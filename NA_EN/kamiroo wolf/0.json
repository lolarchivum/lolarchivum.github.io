Since he is blind but has enhanced hearing, smell, and taste(though the last two aren&#039;t very important), Lee Sin passively gains Tremor Sense. \n\n**Tremor Sense**: Enemy champions and neutral monsters within&nbsp;1350-units that move within the&nbsp;Fog of War&nbsp;have their position revealed for&nbsp;Lee Sin and his allies. This does not grant sight(vision), but Lee can basic attack enemies within melee range and see their silhouettes. \n\nAdditionally, when Lee Sin has Vision of an enemy, his next 2 basic attacks on said enemy have 45% increased attack speed with the first of which ignoring 5% armor and each hit returns 15 furry.\n--------------------------\n**[New]** Q= Sonic Wave/Unwavering Resolve\nCost for Sonic Wave: 50 energy\nCost for Unwavering Resolve: 20 energy.\nRange on Sonic Wave: 1150\nRange on Unwavering Resolve: Melee/Lee Sin\n\nSonic Wave)\nLee Sin shoots a&nbsp;2000-speed wave of sound in a line, dealing 40/60/90/130/160(+80% Bonus AD) physical damage to the first enemy it hits and granting true sight of it for 3 seconds. If Resonating Strike hits, Lee Sin can cast Unwavering Resolve.\n\nUnwavering Resolve)\nNow that Lee Sin has sight of his enemy, he strengthens his resolve against the enemy, dealing true damage with every basic attack towards that enemy while vision is active on them and increasing his own movement speed by 3/6/9/12/15%.\n\nCooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 seconds.\n---------------------------\n\n**[New]** W=Safeguard/Iron Will\nCost on Safeguard: 50 energy\nCost on Iron Will: 30 energy\nRange on Safeguard: 500/525/550/575/600 unit radius.\nRange on Iron Will: Lee Sin\n\nSafeguard)\nLee Sin dashes to a target ally. If this ally is a champion, they and Lee Sin receive a shield worth 0/80/120/160/200(+90% AP) that lasts 1.75/2/2.25/2.5/2.75 seconds. Lee Sin can activate&nbsp;Safeguard&nbsp;on himself to receive the shield, and can cast&nbsp;Iron Will&nbsp;within 3 seconds.\n\nIron Will)\nFor 4 seconds, Lee Sin gains 5/10/15/20/25% bonus life steal and spell vamp.\n\nCooldown: 14 seconds\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**[New]** E=Tempest/Cripple\nCost for Tempest: 50 energy\nCost for Cripple: 30 energy\nRange for Tempest: 425 unit radius\nRange for Cripple:575 unit radius\n\nTempest)\nLee Sin smashes the ground, dealing 50&nbsp;/85/130/165/180(+90% Bonus AD)(+5% AP) magic damage to all nearby enemies and granting true sight of them for 4 seconds. If&nbsp;Tempest&nbsp;hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast&nbsp;Cripple&nbsp;within the next 3 seconds.\n\nCripple)\nLee Sin cripples all enemies within range that are marked by Tempest,&nbsp;reducing&nbsp;their movement speed by 30/35/40/50/60% for 4 seconds, decaying over the duration. Additionally, crippling an enemy will add 1/1.5/2 second(s) to any currently lasting Vision effects.\n\nCooldown: 10 seconds. \n-----------------------------------------\n\nUltimate.\n**[New]** R= Dragon&#039;s Rage\nRange: 400 unit radius\n\nLee Sin launches a powerful roundhouse kick, dealing 250/450/650(+220% Bonus AD) physical damage to a target champion and&nbsp;knocking it back&nbsp;1200 units over 1 second. Enemies the target collides with take the same damage and are&nbsp;knocked airborne&nbsp;for 1 second. \n\n**Here&#039;s the kicker(see what I did there?), however: Lee Sin can only use Dragon&#039;s Rage on enemies he has Vision of.**\n\nCool down: 110/95/80 seconds.\n-------------------\n\nThat&#039;s just my small little rework. I&#039;m always open to comments, concerns, and suggestions so feel free to post them below!","replies":[{"poster":"Bard R Friday","date":"2015-05-06T04:35:16.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. With zero gap closers he will be useless. 0 shield with rank one safeguard? 15% movement speed at max rank q, 5% ap scaling e, 5% armor reduction passive, you have no idea how to balance.

He isn't going to be getting his gap closers back, unfortunately, but I can always up the movement speed so he can at least catch his enemy.\n\nAlso, you are right, I have no idea how to balance.

These changes gut Lee as a character. His entire design is about being highly mobile and early game pressure, which he trades for being a late game knock up bot.

Unfortunately, his Q gap-closer won't be coming back any time soon(sorry), but I can definitely increase the movement speed on his Unwavering Resolve if that would compensate?\n\nAlso, what do you think about what I did to the ultimate? Good or no?","replies":[{"poster":"Daeonic","date":"2015-05-08T15:59:41.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's an interesting concept. I need to take a closer look at the numbers to determine if it is worth the change or not. It doesn't really change his gameplay. I just think it's a little unnecessary. It feels like you're trying to find things to change to make the rework unique. Common with fan reworks or designs, it doesn't really do anything but change his skill order(might not even do that depending on how you play him). If it buffs the damage on his ult then i can see it working. But if it keeps it the same or lowers it then this is very bad idea. I appreciate the effort put in to your rework but i think it's unnecessary. Lee isn't that good right now anyway {{item:3070}} {{champion:64}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bard R Friday","date":"2015-05-06T14:13:37.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck getting your rework accepted without giving him gapclosers. If you really want to make him weaker, just get rid of all this nonsense and nerf the speed or projectile width of his q or something, firing a sonic wave to detect an enemy and then just moving slightly faster towards them doesn't make any sense. I would say to remove the wardhopping, but that's an iconic part of his kit, all Lee Sin players would rage if that was removed. He's strong, but only really in a 1v1. If you just fight him in a group and don't line up to get kicked into eachother, you can fight him easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-05-06T21:57:37.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thezanman,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=YEFH2AOp,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-05-06T14:13:37.993+0000)\n>\n> Good luck getting your rework accepted without giving him gapclosers.
