To counter that, you have the burst sources like mages, AD/AP assassins, and bruisers/fighters who can kill people with either little to no resistances or small health pools in 0.5-2 seconds.

Honestly, an ADC can go 0/10 but as long as they get the items they need and get peel, they will always be a threat.\n\nAs a tank, your job is to watch your team and try to get them to follow you when you engage and peel if your carries are being focused.

It's better to lock down the ulting Master Yi gunning for your ADC and remove him than get the enemy ADC and watch Yi clean up the fight afterwards.  \n\nAs a fighter though, it depends on who you play.  Irelia, for example, has a great gap closer and is meant to dive the backline and destroy a squishy.  So, for characters like her, you want to be looking for an opportunity where you can do that, preferably where the enemy team is busy focusing your tank so you can dive in and disrupt the backline without eating all the CC.\n\nThen again, I play ADC a lot so this is mostly what I see and expect.  You can decide how you want to play though.","replies":[]}]}
