Is he/she something corporal? And if the answer is yes, is he/she alone, or has he/she got some companions with him/her?\nStarting from this point of view i think that the following idea is fitting and the time is right for Riot to show the Original and real Veterans Star Guardians Team, maybe being those who grant the power and protect the new generations of Guardians, idk.\n\nSo, here we go, here&#039;s Doge Kitchen original comment.\n\n**Star Guardian Team 3\n\nLeader: First Star Aurelion Sol (Legendary)\nTeam Members: Star Guardian Pantheon, Star Guardian Taric (Attuned to stars like Lulu and Soraka, Veteran Star Guardian, Retired), Star Guardian Diana,   and Star Guardian Leona\n\n After their bodies have been used by the deities if Mount Targon, Pantheon, Diana, and Leona find theirselves as weak, helpless mortals. Around this time, Taric is at the end of his journey up the mountain and finds himself helping the former god hosts. Taric, along with the rest of the group, collapse in the snowy, barren land. But a bright light arcs from the starry night sky. Brighter than all the rest. It was the First Star. It took the form of a slim dragon. He told them, &quot;I am the First Star. The guardians I have selected are falling and I need more. But this time, I shall join the battle. I have seen all of your strength and I see that you will make excellent guardians.&quot; Taric looked up, and kneeled. &quot;I shall join the fight once more.&quot; The others followed this example. Then all of a sudden, Leona cries out. But it was not one of pain. Bright lights start to burst in each of their bodies, changing the appearance of each newly declared Star Guardian. The First Star turned, then burst into the sky. Taric looked back at his new team, smiled, then shot into the sky behind Aurelion. Soon, the other three rocketed too. The colors gold (Aurelion), blue (Taric), silver (Diana), orange (Leona), and red (Pantheon), illuminated the earth, the heavens, and the universe alike**\n\nSo, what do you think? \nBut, most importantly, do you have any ideas (similar to this one or different, it&#039;s not important), for the New Star Guardian Team 3?\nI&#039;d like to hear you out:)","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-02-11T21:15:04.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking up this necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FeederCricket","date":"2018-03-12T17:39:36.221+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:6}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:427}} \n\nIf this gets 10 upvotes i'll draw some crappy art of them in paint","replies":[{"poster":"Mustafakuń","date":"2018-08-27T19:09:28.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got it!
