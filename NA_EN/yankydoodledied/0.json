Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nAccording to [Riot Tantram](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000):\n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely.\n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [{quoted}](name=yankydoodledied,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=doyHB5IN,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-22T01:15:58.007+0000)\n>\n> It sucks that people spend a lot of money on this game and many lose all their money.\n\nYes, but only for those toxic players, and they earned that punishment and knew it was coming.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=yankydoodledied,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=doyHB5IN,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-22T01:15:58.007+0000)\n>\n> I find that there shouldn't be sush a severe punishment to players after 2 chances because it's not fair to people who are trying to get over things.\n\nIt's very fair. The same rules apply to everyone. How about the people who don't want to deal with your failure to \"get over things\"?

It isn't Riots job to keep you in check, it's your job. Regardless of whether or not you have anger issues, the \"mute all\" option is something that exists for a reason. If you know you struggle to keep your cool, then mute yourself and mute your teammates. Even people who remain calm often do it anyways as a way to cut out chatter and other toxic players. 2 chances to fix your attitude or do something about it is more then enough.

For the first one, the level 20 challenge, they did release details as seen [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**Why can’t you give permanent banned players a second chance? You will receive a better player.**\nActually, this is the unfortunate problem. Allowing permanently banned players another chance is an extremely damaging cost. Do you know what the success rate of the Level 20 Challenge was? 5%. Do you know that for each person, they clearly outlined the toxic behaviors and had 1 on 1 conversations with the players to try to improve their behavior? These are players that were hand-picked by Player Support staff because they felt the pleas from these players were genuine. The success rate was still 5%.\n\n>Do you know how many games on average these players played? 100 games / month. When a permanently banned player fails to reform, they are creating miserable experiences for hundreds, maybe thousands of players a month. That's not a cheap cost or a low risk and we cannot consciously justify that, for the sake of the rest of our players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bubonica","date":"2020-01-24T00:09:32.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately if they unbanned you then they would have to unban others.
