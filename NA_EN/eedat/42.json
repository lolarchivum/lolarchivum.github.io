Even if they have clear weaknesses and regardless if they&#039;re strong in the current meta.\n\nI&#039;ll start with mine:\n\n{{champion:45}}: I know, **I know.** He&#039;s an immobile mage that gets one spell rotation off in a team fight. I get it. But that feeling getting caught in his  cage and knowing you&#039;re about to be 100-0&#039;d by a 2/4/3 Veigar tilts me. I honestly think it has to do with his point and click nuke of an ult more than anything. Tilted me even more when his ult scaled with **your** AP. He has weaknesses, I know. Doesn&#039;t mean he doesn&#039;t tilt me though\n\n{{champion:23}}: Yes, &quot;lots of champs counter him&quot;. But if you don&#039;t counter him, its miserable. Starting off with the RNG crits from the very start. Try to trade with him and get crit twice without any crit items. **Tilted.** Its not like Jhin or Cait when you know their crit is up. It&#039;s just random. Absolutely nothing you can do to predict or play around it. Even if you dominate him in lane, he will eventually get to a point where you need to send at least two people to deal with him. Leave him alone in lane for 1 minute and he takes two towers. Yes, he&#039;s horrible in team fights. Yes, he&#039;s weak to CC. Yes, some niche top laners can kite him into oblivion. Still tilts me.\n\nHow about you?","replies":[{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2016-09-15T06:07:59.271+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-09-15T13:00:27.153+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fuck that guy.
