So having 19 out of the top 20 being AP is actually expected. Not to mention that out of those 5 AD champions, 2 of them are way better top lane...Actually looking at the list, 4 out of those 5 champions have a higher win rate for Top lane over their Mid lane.\n\nAs for ADCs being nerfed for going Mid lane, that was because they were \"probably\" crowding out and out-beating the AP champions in they're own lane, a lane that most of them can only go. It's the same reason why {{champion:117}} has seen so many nerfs apparently when she strolls into Top/Mid lane. Yes we do now have {{champion:115}} going bot now, but that isn't destroying and forcing any ADCs out of their lane, and in fact I rarely ever see it anymore anyways, which is why that wasn't nerfed.\n\nAs for the conversation of {{item:3157}} vs {{item:3156}}, I wouldn't normally mind how strong Maw was if Zhonyas just felt better as a rush item or if Seeker's was a good item to rush as well. Most AD champions who go mid to fight Mages are usually Manaless champions or generally have low mana costs. Hexdrinker alone gives you everything you would want (besides for Lethality I guess), and even if you really don't feel like you need Maw....getting a Hexdrinker and then going into a Lethality item is something that you have options to do, and you don't really trade off much if anything to do that.\n\nMages on the other hand, most mages have mana cost and some even have very high mana cost...some even to the point that you literally have to build double mana items {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} which means you can't even think about getting Zhonyas until way later on...But even for the champions that don't need that double mana scaling items, they generally would need some form of mana which usually is {{item:3165}}. If they get Zhonya's then they'll have the defense to maybe live from some AD champions but they wouldn't have the mana to keep up with their wave clear or poke AND then have the mana to attempt a fight if they get jumped on. Not to mention the stats for Zhonyas is just terrible, and honestly I hate to even think about rushing it as a first item, even if I was up against an AD Assassin, unless I was playing a champion that really didn't need to much and didn't have mana problems like Mid {{champion:85}} then I could see it.\n\nIf they made Seeker's a bit better as an item, maybe give it a mini-zhonyas or maybe something else or just increase the stats it gives then maybe I could see it being a good option to rush.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aqours fanboy","date":"2017-04-08T10:16:31.827+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"AD is far better and a {{item:3155}} or {{item:3211}}  makes APs in lane *irrelevant.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2017-04-08T00:21:33.930+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well that happens when most of the midlaners are ap to begin with, how you think you're making a good point here is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-04-08T01:18:17.256+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Because anytime AD champions go Mid the community demands they be removed.
