They've been using animation canceling as a core mechanic waaay back when it was **actually** a bug in like the street fighter II days in 1991. Back then, they decided it worked out better with it so they kept it and every single fighting game that came after implemented it as a core gameplay mechanic and balanced around it, taking it away and adding it as needed as well when it was deemed unhealthy. (Illaoi and Rengar anyone?)\n\nSo how you can tell me that a character released in 2011 that was based on fighting games was not intentionally supposed to use their core mechanic of animation canceling since 1991 of all things is far beyond me. You just can't tell me they \"just so happened\" to run into the same bug unintentionally as they did way back 20 years earlier while also referencing the genre that practically institutionalized the use of animation canceling as a gameplay design point. \n\nIts actually ludicrous that people insist on the idea that animation canceling was not intentional and was an exploit. Its like you guys are actively refusing to knowledge some core truths in the place of what would be the most convenient for your view. \n\nRiven was based off fighting games, which have been using animation canceling for over two decades. There is not possible way you can actively reference something then just kinda accidentally run into the 20 year hallmark game mechanic of fighting games. \n\nRiven's animation canceling was intentional from the start.","replies":[{"poster":"LordForrest","date":"2017-05-21T03:48:05.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't. If you look back at all the old stuff from her release, there is no mention of animation canceling at all. It wasn't even a thing until she was balanced and people were trying to find an edge on her.  Even then it still didn't become prevalent until the tiamat change and addition of ravenous hydra.\n\nYes, animation canceling is a core mechanic of fighting games, but they have no place in a game like league. Most other cases of animation canceling are removed, because they cause problems.  There are exceptions, like any champion that can exploit Tiamat spaghetti code (others can, Riven is just the most famous).  Those tend to be ones that are not cost effective to fix or not easy or consistent to proc.  In the case of Riven her base stats were dumpstered so she wasn't broken in the hands of those mains who were exploiting the bug and will be just like yorick and heimerdinger before her left to rot for years before they actually fix anything.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2017-05-20T05:50:05.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who the hell calls ward hopping a bug??\n\nmordes bugs are left in the game, highly doubt they're intended to be there","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-05-20T08:22:53.084+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ward hopping was originally a bug that came from wards being coded as minions.
