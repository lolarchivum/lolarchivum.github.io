Her W is really really stupid at targeting, might as well make it a skillshot where all 3 flames will converge on where you click. That would probably balance it out too, considering she wouldn't be able to Ult in and W for 30-60% of a squishes hp (because the ability to nuke the a precious squishy adc screams for nerfs). Might even give a reason to max it second as well.\n\nI don't think that nerfing her ult cd will do jack considering its no game changer like Oriana, and all ult cd's are basically around a minute by late game anyway. They are always up for the next teamfight. I don't really think changing damage or mana costs is the solution. Her base ms is pretty low for a midlaner already. Her base armor and her auto attacks aren't the problem. If they change the way her Q and thunderlords work then she won't be able to proc it with charm and Q, and W its one of the worst targeting abilities in the game other than mordes ghosts or daisy so that wouldn't be able to proc it either.\n\nIDK what kind of reasonable discussion you are looking for. I've seen rational arguments for both sides about this. My question to you is what exactly you want to see from this thread? Ahri nerfs most definitely. Of course you are, you wouldn't be making a post unless you had some axe to grind. There, I gave my reasons and my proposed nerfs. Take what you want from what I said. My bet is that everyone will have downvoted this based off of the username and length of the post rather than the points made.

She can steal the life force/essence of anyone she targets. While I haven't seen Ahri played in my games for a while or played Ahri for that matter, I still think the prospect of playing against one would be an interesting game mid lane. From what I see with her kit is that most of her attacks are skill shots or abilities that have an AI targeting to it and her ulti is directional. This would lead me to believe that her damage comes from being able to land her skill shots and combos efficiently, and her ult helps to position her spells to do optimal damage. \n\nTl;Dr, Passive is heal because of lore, and I'm guessing Ahri's damage comes from being able to land skill shot abilities well and know ing how to position to optimize trades.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-03-28T19:33:26.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I want to know what people think about changed her 3 dash ultimate to 2 dashes but compensate it with a bit more damage.\nI feel like Ahri is a bit too mobile as she is.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2017-03-28T19:50:28.932+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ahri's base damages are some of the lowest in the game.

She doesn't have any spell that *also* does Physical Damage nor any enhancement to increase her Physical Damage output; so she can be countered by building HP/MR like every other mage in the game.\n\n-She can't hold a zone at all, actually. She affects the area around her strongly, but she can't incentivize everybody away from that location, instead ambushing and running (e.g. pick potential).
