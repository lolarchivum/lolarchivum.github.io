Though, when it came to be known that all they did was make another no where near the center of the NA, many grew angry because they felt let down. \n\nLag was the main issue ever since I first got onto the Boards. It was always there and it never grew out. \n\nWhen I see a new skin, I think, \"wow, that's cool\" unless its a 750 skin that has a set with some others (I still find it cool but sad to see its not like how Riot use to do it, like the Pool Party skins). Riot already has at least 200–300 skins on the market. They also have rare skins that few are able to get and more that people are able to buy. \n\nIf Riot were to be working tirelessly, I would had seen way more progress on Ao Shin after 3 years of waiting. You can't be working hard when you aren't working on everything and leave it for another (better) time.\n\nI also know that they will not put out all these servers in a year. It's way to hard as just doing 1 should take almost a month with tests and such.

The same client reappears, and says the game crashed, with a nice little reconnect button on it. Of course, the obvious choice is to click reconnect, which is what I did. The same thing happened, it just made the client disappear then reappear. I probably kept on clicking reconnect for about 20 minutes, with nothing to gain from it. It didn't count as anything as a leave all three times. My first was a ranked, and then my second was a normal game and my third was a bots game because I got suspicious at that point. I'm not in low priority queues... During the first, the ranked game, I tried re-logging. and reconnecting a few times and it didn't work. During the normal match I repaired the client, still didn't work, and during the AI game I literally un-installed the whole game and re-installed which still didn't work. I'm in Canada so NA, and I'm wondering if this is a localized problem or does anyone else have this issue? Also, if anyone knows a possible fix to this issue that'd be great.
