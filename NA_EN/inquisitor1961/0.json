Those are fantastically strong women and Illaoi seems to have a bodyshape that seems inspired more in that direction.  (I didn't work on the champ and don't know if those women were directly referenced in Illaoi's creation.)\n\nI think the problem here is, much like if I were talking about male body types and only brought up pro boxers or MMA fighters, that they are only picking from a certain subset of \"strong women\" (ie. strike-based fighters and grapplers that try to fit within a certain weight range since it determines who they will be fighting). \n\nJust doing a quick Google search, there are also women like Aja Kong and Miki Satoyama that compete with their strength, just like how there are guys like Brian Shaw and Manny Pacquiao--two very different dudes, but I can't really think of anyone who wouldn't consider them both to be strong. In Street Fighter, you've got guys like E. Honda and Vega and Birdie and Dhalsim duking it out--all very different guys! (Although unfortunately, the female end of the roster has a much more limited range, and even more unfortunately, this isn't really something out of the ordinary--aside from a monster or two, even League's roster suffers from this)\n\nAlthough, Vi to me seems like she'd fit more easily into someone like Samantha Wright's bodytype. Tough and compact, like a fist (and undoubtedly strong enough to lift up those gauntlets and hurt people with them), which could also be a fun juxtaposition with Caitlyn's more tall and narrow silhouette. I'm not going to harp on too much about Vi since what's done is done and Riot's artistic vision has certainly brought them a degree of success (and it's possible that I'm just looking at things the wrong way), but it kinda says something to me that Vi and Quinn have the same base body, yet the latter still reads 100% as a lithe and agile scout. You can't really do the same thing with Braum and TF, for instance!\n\nYou folks are getting a bit better about keeping the guys and gals of League on somewhat even ground (Illaoi is a nice contrast to the rest of the female roster, even if she doesn't immediately make it as varied and interesting as the male side), so I've got a good amount of faith that we'll be seeing some interesting and divergent silhouettes in the future.

U:\n\nI'm not even going to blame Riot on this one, I honestly doubt they designed her with \"Let's totally make her look weak\" in mind. It's just that what Vi is, is \"default,\" and it's the same pretty much everywhere else in the industry. In Street Fighter, you've got fighters ranging from Zangief to Vega to Birdie to Ken, but among, say, Cammy/Chun Li/R. Mika/Karin/Laura, there's still some variance (Chun Li's thighs dwarf Karin's, Laura's wearing a belt, R. Mika's parents are alive), but not nearly as much as the male end of the roster. Hell, even looking at Overwatch, you've got a dwarf and a huge armored knight and a guy with a pig belly, but the ladies range from \"hourglass sexy\" to \"not as hourglass sexy\" to \"Zarya\" etc. (This kind of stuff is why rosters like Indivisble's get me so hype--I'm always a fan of over-the-top and stylized silhouettes, but it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth when that sort of treatment is as one-sided as it tends to be)\n\nBut back to the point! Vi's a champion from an era (hopefully) long past, where champions like Leona and Syndra and Lux and Riven didn't vary as much as Garen and Ezreal and Braum and Lee Sin, despite representing wildly different archetypes and fantasies. It's a shame that Vi and Caitlyn aren't as juxtaposed physically as they are in just about every other way, but hopefully Illaoi is the start of Riot getting a bit more comfortable and branching out from the default more readily when it comes to lady champions (and not making the common mistake of seeing their gender as a factor that limits design choices). I look forward to the day where we can have gals as jolly as Gragas, as crooked as Swain, and as torn-the-hell-up as the new Gangplank.

In that case, she'd have the built core and legs of a professional weightlifter, but that's also not the case. \n\n-Even if it's artistic license, or somebody at Riot came onto the forums tomorrow and explained that Vi is actually the physically weakest champion and she's lifting the gauntlets because of magic because they said so, that brings forth an even more important question--why? Why does a character who is meant to be rugged, who is defined by her rough demeanor and preference for brute force, have the same base model as Quinn, who is the opposite of those things? Braum is big and broad-shouldered, has muscles to spare, and carries around a huge metal door/shield because he is characterized by his strength and durability. Twisted Fate is slim and lean and wiry because he relies more on his wits than his fists, and isn't built like a brick house because that would only slow him down. Gragas is vast and jolly and beer-bellied because he's the ultimate boozed-up bruiser, he has his weight and knows how to throw it around (and he still needs to be able to carry and throw around that big cask, too). \n\nI can make up any number of excuses as to why Vi doesn't embody her character as much as she could, why her whole archetype falls flat the moment you take away her gloves (you can take away Garen's sword, he's still a goddamn linebacker), but that's pointless. It's okay to like things despite (or even because of) their flaws. I still think Vi is a really cool character, she was my favorite for over a year.

There is however a contradiction between what your expectations of a female that is robust, tough, a tank, and etc. should look like and what {{champion:254}} looks like. I mean that's like looking at {{champion:420}} and saying that she can't or shouldn't be a femme fatal or a seductress simply because she has more muscle (I personally find her sexy... don't tell {{champion:41}} I said that). League of Legends is a fictional world with fictional characters so I think it's safe to say that there are going to be characters that don't meet our expectations of what a certain champ with a certain archetype will look like. I mean look at Cloud from Final Fantasy VII; he looks way too thin to be carrying his buster sword but he does it anyway. It's who he is. Changing Vi to have the same body definition as Illaoi would take way a sense of badassery that she already has. Vi is tough and robust because of her lack of muscles; I mean if you were to see a \"thin\" person carrying around something large and heavy with relative ease what might be your first impression? That is one tough, strong badass. It may not meet your expectations of what that person can do, but it doesn't take away your perception of that person being a tough, strong badass does it? Now if there is ever a lore event where Riot decides to give Vi an updated body definition after using the gloves for so long then I don't mind that, but to say that Riot didn't do Vi justice by making her \"thin\" gives me the impression that you might've missed the point. Vi being \"thin\" is what makes her tough badass and differentiates her from the other badasses in League. Oh and I don't know about you, but even though she doesn't look like she could punch my teeth out without the gloves, after seeing her use them with such ease, I would like to think that I would know better than to start a fight with her.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-01-02T15:45:12.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a principle in character design, where creating the strongest impact comes from absolute unity or absolute juxtaposition. Let's take two of League's characters as examples: Garen is meant to portray a strong character--this is done by giving him a sturdy build, bulky armor, and a massive sword; the updated Poppy is also meant to portray a strong character--which, in this case, is done by juxtaposing her small frame with her massive weapon.\n\nThese are two very different characters, and they portray two very different ideas of \"strength\"--Garen is a mighty juggernaut, while Poppy is a determined little Yordle-who-could. Every aspect of a character's design is the result of a tool being used, and each tool has their consequence. A character with unity is something because of what they are, a character with juxtaposition is something despite of what they are.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem that a lot of people in this thread are going \"It's okay for Vi to have the same delicate wimp arms as Sona, it juxtaposes with her massive gauntlets and really brings to light how vulnerable she is without them!\" and that would be entirely true, if the core of Vi's character was that she was innately vulnerable and was nothing without those gauntlets, like if you [took the Philosopher's Stone away from Envy](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/f/f9/True-forms.png/revision/latest?cb=20140104182234) (which was an element used to juxtapose them with the protagonists, who seemingly lost everything, but whose innate qualities allowed them to build themselves back up again every time), then this would all make sense. In Vi's case, however, her gauntlets are an extension of her strength rather than the source of them, which could be evidenced in their inception--she saw people in trouble, she wrenched those suckers off of some robot, and then she proceeded to punch the shit out of some rubble. Even before that, [she was characterized by being rough, tough, and self-sufficient](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vi/Background)--she was all of these things before the gauntlets, and that's why she has them in the first place.\n\nIf the argument here is that Vi should not appear strong (and she doesn't have to be an obelisk like Illaoi--a compact build similar to Samantha Wright's would probably suit what she does better and could also juxtapose nicely with Cait's tall-and-narrow silhouette), then I'd say it would be wildly inaccurate to her character, it would be a cue that sends all the wrong messages--messages such as \"she's not so tough without the gloves\" or \"her core character trait is vulnerability\" and so on.\n\nGoing to the Cloud example, I'm going to borrow from professional wrestling with the concept of a \"sell\"--usually when a move wants to be portrayed as powerful, both wrestlers will have to \"sell\" it to the crowd. The wrestler performing the move should look like they're giving their all, while the wrestler receiving it should look like they're getting thrown by a much more powerful force than the first wrestler is exerting. Like with Cloud, you can look at him swing the sword around as if it were weightless, but that doesn't sell the weight of the sword or Cloud's strength, it only makes the sword look really, really light (and the Final Fantasy series as a whole tends to not have a great track record when it comes to a lot of their character designs, as iconic as they may be). Someone like [Guts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIA9xg2oIew&feature=youtu.be), on the other hand, is clearly physically strong, and is sword is massive, but he still shows exertion when he swings it and the wind-up/wind-down is often exaggerated, which serves to \"sell\" both how strong Guts is and how heavy his sword is (Ike from the most recent iteration of Smash Bros. is another good example of this, especially since now you can see him side-by-side with Cloud). Of course, none of this means that Cloud is a horrible character design, but it does mean that looking at him side-by-side with, say, Sabin or Azul, it would be very easy to say that they are (or seem to be) more capable of feats of strength than him. I'd flinch much more easily at one of Lee Sin's punches than those from the Vi in this teaser if she's not wearing those big ol' gloves, and that kind of sucks. \n\nWinding back up to the \"Illaoi can't be a femme fatale\" and stuff like that, I'm not saying she can't be charming because of her build (in fact, a lot of her unique charm comes from that build), but if you wanted a character who reads as a sly and coy master of manipulation, you'd go for someone like Miss Fortune or LeBlanc, not Illaoi (who would seem more likely to manipulate you with her physical strength and overpowering personality--and every time we see her in the story, that's exactly what she does!).\n\nAnyway, long story short, Vi could make sense as a character with wimp arms like Sona's, but that would require her to be a completely different character than what has been shown to us so far, and that her physique is much more likely a result of the weird self-imposed and habitual limitations a lot of people put on female characters (hence why a lot of them look the same aside from recent outliers like Illaoi), rather than an intentional design decision to use it as a meaningful character cue.","replies":[{"poster":"Splision","date":"2016-01-02T21:02:59.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand what you are saying and it all makes sense, but meh... I'm still going to have to disagree. I feel like it's a limitation in of itself to think that Vi and Illaoi should share the same body type. Does it make sense that they should?

They shouldn't share bodytypes for the same reason Vi and Quinn or Riven and Sona shouldn't share bodytpes, that being that they are completely different characters. Hell, even with Garen and Lee Sin both being strong fighting dudes, Lee's more athletic and nimble build suits him more than Garen's linebacker brawn does. If anything, Vi should be more dense and compact, like a fist--which would help tie her more to her weapon (Like how Braum's wide shoulders and broad chest tie him to his, or like how it would be really weird to see Garen running around with Katarina's daggers), and would have the added bonus of juxtaposing her more with Caitlyn, her partner in crime (or I guess crime-fighting in this case). \n\nListening to Vi talk in-game, looking at her backstory, and all that stuff, it would make sense for her to be not look as delicate as Sona as far as physique and build goes (if I haven't mentioned how weird it is that she and Quinn share a base model while Quinn still reads as a lithe and agile scout, I'll do that now). She's rough, she's tough, and she's self-sufficient, so even though a lot of people in this thread are making the wild claim that she's somehow nothing without her power fists, I think she'd be fine without them--she certainly wasn't getting pushed around before she made them. \n\nIt just makes sense that a character's personality (or at least their core) should be reflected in their physical appearance, since we're talking about characters here, and specifically, characters that are designed for people to be able to read easily due to their MOBA context (with over 100 characters, you shouldn't have to read every bio to get the gist). The new Poppy is small because Riot wanted a character who was a bit of an underdog and did amazing things despite their size (it's also why they made her hammer so big). Braum is big and broad because Riot wanted a character who looked invincible, and used that invincibility to help others. Rek'Sai is sharp and angular and inhuman because Riot wanted a character who looked like a fearsome and alien predator, and so on. Character design is a process, and every decision has its repercussions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-01-02T04:44:51.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Garen has to swing the sword, it doesn't do the work all by itself like Vi's gloves do.

Vi's personality isn't what would make her ripped, not using a dyi hextech as apposed to a traditional weapon like Garen or Darius might help though. \n\nYou just nitpicking something for the sake of complaining, and there is no real reason to continue this conversation. \n\nAlso the Sejuani complaints aren't because of sex appeal, its because of inconsistency. We covered up Sejuani becasue she didn't dress the way you should in her environment.

Also, not saying that having Vi's personality would instantly make somebody ripped, but having a body that matched her personality/character traits/archetype/fighting style/etc. would make sense from a character design perspective, since it's that sort of holistic quality that makes a character resonate with themself. It's why Braum is built like a circus strongman, why Gragas is big-boned, and why Lucian is lithe.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather nitpick than just accept everything as it's given. Riot's too honest for me to be quiet about things I think they could've done better. Lowering my standards for them would be a disservice. \n\nThe Sejuani argument's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, it would make sense if they were all as covered up as Sejuani is; on the other hand, having Tryndamere bare-chested helps characterize his hot-bloodedness and having Braum bare-chested is a good way to show his natural indestructibility and inner warmth; on somebody else's hand [old Sejuani](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/0/00/Sejuani_TraditionalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151016025748) wasn't really built like them (and even with a bit of added bulk, she still isn't), and part of the issue was that she was wearing a chainmail bikini rather than something more fitting to her rough and brutish nature. Personally, with the context of Trynd and Braum, I'd be cool with Sejuani showing more skin if she were built like her boar and traded in her cleavage-amplifying Freljord's Secret chestpiece for a cool chest-wrap or whatever the barbarian equivalent of a sports bra is (since they tend to be good about keeping things in their place during rigorous physical activity). You can have [cool and strong female characters](http://i10.mangareader.net/teppu/7/teppu-1245226.jpg) that show a lot of skin without being inherently sexualized or silly-looking, but old Sejuani was not one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-01-02T18:12:44.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"How do I know Vi's gloves do all the work, its very simple and I've stated it multiple times.

I mean half of her animations show the gloves charging up and basically using some jet propelled system to allow her to dash across the air and uppercut people ten feet of the ground. \n\nIts good to know you are just nitpicking for the sake of arguing. \n\nAlso your Sejuani answer is a nice cop out. However Sejuani is the leader of her people and described as being able to go toe to toe with the strongest of them. If its too cold for her and she needs to be armored from head to toe than the same should be true of everyone of the Frejlord.

We're talking about weapons here, my dude, and in fiction (and video games especially), they are typically used as an extension of a character's core--just as weapons in real life are used as the extension of the wielder's body. This is also ignoring the fact that Vi wasn't born with the gloves, and she certainly wasn't powerless without them--even in her backstory, one of her primary traits is her self-sufficiency. Vi's brash, she's brutish, and I'm sure that would be the same without the gloves--so again, it wouldn't make sense for her to have Sona's arms under there.\n\nI'm nitpicking because I see something that doesn't make sense, and I like it when things make sense. If Riot didn't \"nitpick\" their own work, we wouldn't have any balance patches, and that's not something I'd like to think about. Ever had a Jax jump you from the fog of war and tear you apart while \"dodge\" text floated over head? Do you remember Release Xin Zhao? Shit wasn't pretty.\n\nSejuani is also not the leader of every Freljordian (and if I recall, Trynd's married to Ashe and Braum is...also alleged with her, I think?); even then, if you looked at Sejuani in her previous iteration (supermodel in a sexy barbarian costume) or took the armor off of current Sejuani (where not much is different), she wouldn't *look* like she could survive the cold, contrary to Braum and Trynd.

Also, it was her nature that led to her acquiring those gloves (her willingness to get her hands dirty for the sake of others is the reason she wrenched those fists off of a robot in the first place)--even if the gauntlets did 100% of everything (and even then, Vi would still have to carry their weight), that would be like saying Thor became worthy of Mjolnir after picking it up. It's an extension of her personality, not something that magically transformed her entire character. Unfortunately, since the details on Vi's hextech weaponry are almost nonexistant beyond \"she punches things with them\" and \"she took them from a mining robot,\" we can't really say whether or not Vi just kicks back and lets them do all the punching. It would be stupid if they did, though, and that Vi was just a wimp without them, because that contrasts with her established character--maybe if she were someone like Heimerdinger or Ekko ([who has more defined arms than Vi](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a7/Ekko_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150514004039 ) ) who are wimpy but clever and use their brains more than their brawn, it would make sense, but this image of Vi clashes with the character that gleefully says \"Punch fist, ask questions while punching.\" Also, how come Jayce gets to have a superman build? Surely, his hammer with all its fancy jet propulsion could do all the work if the writer felt like it, but giving him his build and posture help convey his character. How come champs like Leona, Nidalee, Riven, and Sivir don't look like they partake in the heavy physical labor they clearly do (whether hoisting around heavy gear or needing to be at top physical condition to survive), when [Malz](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/3e/Malzahar_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120201041322), [Ryze](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/ce/Ryze_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120801131905), [Kass](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/7d/Kassadin_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121025184138), and [Varus](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/16/Varus_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120407043111) look like they make good use out of their gym memberships and nobody asks why or has to justify it? Vi's just an example of something bigger, and seeing a lot of the comments in this thread, I understand why.\n\nIt is, thank you. There are very similar elements between them--Riot wants Tahm to stay true to his core, so they smack his mobility rather than his utility or durability. I want Vi to better represent her core, so I point out how silly it is that she doesn't look like she'd have more than a 50/50 chance of beating a dainty musician at arm wrestling. If Riot wants Vi to seem like what it seems like they want Vi to seem like (rough, tough, enjoys punching things and people), giving her wimp arms or making it seem like she's nothing without the power fists isn't the way to go about it. If Riot comes on the forums tomorrow and says \"Well, we're deciding to change what Vi's all about because it better suits our creative vision\" then I'd happily accept it. Vi might no longer be my favorite character, but I wouldn't be able to gripe about her being internally inconsistent or not as well-executed as she could be.\n\nThe thing is, Sejuani doesn't look as strong as anyone in the Freljord. She doesn't look as strong as Braum or Tryndamere or Olaf or Willump or Volibear, or, hell, even Woad King Darius. Without her boar, I wouldn't bet on her in any of those fights. Illaoi, however, is a completely different story. If you have to _tell_ me that Sejuani is as strong as or stronger than every other muscleman in the frozen north, if the only way I could understand that is if you were to _inform_ me, then her character design has failed to do its one thing: convey. Also, you do realize you're trying to defend a willowy waif socking people with massive, metal Sock 'Em Boppers™, which is more ridiculous than Braum and Trynd, because it puts a greater strain on the willing suspension of disbelief. With Braum and Trynd, you have a train of thought: you look at them, and go \"oh, they're strong\" -> \"they are physically substantial\" -> \"they partake in a lot of physical activity\" -> \"they may be able to survive in the tundra because of their physical might/endurance, constant physical activity, or a more abstract inner heat (hotbloodedness in Trynd's case, warm-heartedness is Braum's case)\". Again, this is why it wouldn't make sense if TF was out there in pool shorts and little else. He's a lanky dude, there's nothing to keep him warm (muscles or fat), and he doesn't seem particularly vigorous or tenacious. With Vi, it's just \"Well, Vi's this cool girl who's really rough and tumble, but she doesn't have any muscles because her gloves are magic and a wizard did it and I said so!!!!\" It's why Guts looks stronger than Cloud--hell, even Sion and Mega Gnar look like powerhouses, and feel powerful when you show how hard it is to do what they do (the channel on Sion's Q and the delay on Mega Gnar's rock toss). Vi being waif-like undersells her strength and considering what Riot's blog posts on character design have said so far, it's not an A+ on their part.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't put too much time into getting through to you, and as useful as putting my own thoughts down on the table and figuring out why things work the way they do is useful to me for my own work, further replies are going to be a bit shorter (especially if I need to repeat myself).
