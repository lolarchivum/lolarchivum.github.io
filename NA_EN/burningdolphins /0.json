I have to say, although Season 5's meta stagnated about halfway through (Jinx and Vayne were the only ADCs ever played, Thresh was the only support ever played, for example), the game had a different feel to it that I can't quite put to words. Games felt as if they didn't snowball hard, but at the same time, you felt rewarded if you performed well early on in a game. \n\nTo be completely honest, the main reason I dislike this season is the fact that personal skill feels so invaluable versus working together as a team, but at the same time, it's as if this season people are just... worse. I don't mean that as an insult, it just feels like everyone has become less talented and either spams a champion due to its recently discovered power o because that's the only champion they use. I wouldn't even disclude myself from this, I main Karma and use her almost solely, but the season just feels like a downgrade and I'm not at all sure how it can be solved to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-09-04T04:25:29.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Jinx main, I can confirm that games snowballed VERY hard during that Jinx/Vayne time period. That was in fact the whole point of playing them. They're champions that snowball. Games are now SHORTER than season 5, but they are no more snowbally. The majority of games back then went until 40 minutes, but they were still decided in the early game. Teams would get an early lead, and hug towers, farm, and grow advantage until they're so far ahead they could stomp. That was what a lot of season 5 was: a lot of wasting time and sitting around.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-09-04T04:30:38.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said it way better than I could!

It's basically very easy to get stuck on the game's current issues this season, or just this patch, and complain that it's in its worst state yet, despite these problems being far less dire compared to those of the previous season: for example, Season 5's jungle was murder on all but a few champions, Season 4 had a tremendously snowbally laning phase, which meant only early game champions could ever be viable, Season 3 had supports build nothing but Vision Wards and a gold item, Season 2, despite being strangely popular among a few players here, featured balancing problems so hilariously terrible that they are still remembered to this day (Metagolem, anyone?), and Season 1 featured some of the game's most egregious mistakes in champion design, including release Irelia, Vladimir, Xin Zhao and Yorick, mistakes that took until very recently to begin fixing properly.
