While there I played A TON of games, freshman and sophomore year was 1400 hours of competitive TF2 (scout, sniper, medic) and Junior and Senior year found me addicted to League of Legends.  I applied to riot my senior winter after realizing finance wasn&#039;t for me and joined the champ team as a designer shortly after graduation in 2012.\n\n**WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT?**\n\nMy primary role here is making champions.  Past projects (love affairs?) include Vi, Jinx, Gnar, and Ekko.  I&#039;m currently working on #5 who&#039;ll be coming out next (he&#039;s freaking awesome).  Asides from direct mechanics design I&#039;ve also been heavily involved in early concept ideation for the majority of the champs to have come out in 2014 and 2015 as well as a few that are still yet to be released. Also (when I have time) enjoy helping out other teams such as live gameplay or systems.  I headed up the keystone masteries project for the recent preseason with Stashu and Squad5 and am one of the many people to have nerfed Lucian.\n\n**WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?**\n\nFirstly, feel free to ask me about any of the champs or projects I&#039;ve worked on (including lore and theme stuff).  It&#039;s no secret here that I&#039;m my champs&#039; biggest fanboi and as such I know A LOT about them.  Also have quite a bit to say about general design philosophy and how we work on champion team. An awesome part about Riot is that all our designers work in different ways with different preferences.  A champion made by me is going to be very different from one made by CertainlyT. Finally, I&#039;m still one of the younger designers (24), so if your&#039;re wondering about what it&#039;s generally like to get out of college, find a job, and grow and learn in your profession, that&#039;s something I&#039;ve been very close to for the last 3 years.  I started out here pretty clueless (Vi was my first design pretty much ever) and still feel like there&#039;s so many ways I could improve and get better.\n\n**WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?**\n\nOf course if there&#039;s anything else you want to ask about just shoot it my way.  I&#039;ll answer most anything as long as I have the context to do so (please don&#039;t ask me why your game crashed yesterday, I can&#039;t help with that).\n\n**Note: Not going to have much time to answer stuff today (12/18) but ask anyways, I'll be hopping online Saturday to really get the conversation going.**","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2015-12-22T23:20:29.399+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's play a game; I'll give you a concept, a place of origin and role and you make a champ and kit concept around it.

Also most of these skills are probably bad.  Also this may not actually be an assassin.\n\n**Blair, of the Ruby Vanguard**\n\nBlair is a young demacian woman who is not as she seems.  Inducted into the highest ranks of the royal army at an early age, many were astounded by her swift rise through the ranks and downright stunned when she was appointed to the Ruby Vanguard, the crown's elite assassination unit, tasked with eliminating enemy commanders before a battle even began.  Only the crown and other members of the Ruby Vanguard know Blair for what she truely is, a host, bound by sorcery and united under a single conscience.\n\n**P - Resuscitate** (This is a fun mechanic I've been playing around with, seems like it would fit an insect theme)\nBlair can right-click nearby corpses (minions or champions) to dissolve into a cloud of insects and teleport to them, consuming the corpse and healing herself.  This can be cast after death on champion corpses to revive herself\n**Q - Barrage of Stingers**\n-On an Ammo System, has 3 charges\n-Blair fires off an insect missile that deals damage to the first target hit and applies a stack of \"weakness\" to them.\n-Blair's attacks gain X AD per stack of weakness on their target.\n**W - Consuming swarm**\n-Pure Passive\n- Every third attack or spell on an enemy champion afflicts them with Consuming Swarm, consuming swarm stacks infinitinely, and after 3 seconds of not being applied will detonate, dealing X damage per stack and healing Blair for Y\n**E - Cloud of Pain**\n- Blair dissolves into a cloud of insects, becoming untargetable and dashing to the target location over .5 seconds.  Any enemies along the travel path take X damage.\n**R - Assault of the Ruby Vanguard** (I've always wanted to do this ability for an assassin)\nBlair attaches insect swarms to all nearby allies, allowing them to apply **W - Consuming Swarm** to enemies for the next 15 seconds.  R can be recast during this time to allow Blair to globally teleport to any enemy afflicted by Consuming Swarm.","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2015-12-23T02:17:05.245+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow! lol this is awesome, I wish this was a real champ and i see why you have your job.

(Because it gave EVERYONE a three-hit passive)","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-12-19T23:14:02.582+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"A lot of people ask this as a joke,  but I'm going to give you a super serious answer with lots of DESIGN LEARNINGS.\n\nI really do think 3-hit passives are great design, for the reason that they tend to add large amounts of tension and impact to moments that would normally have none.\n\nExample: Let's take a look at Alistar. On top of the cleanse and near invuln status, his ult also gives him 60-90 AD.  Did you know that?  Most players don't.  It adds a ton of power and yet it's hard to feel and not all that compelling for a lot of people.  Now let's take that same spell and instead say, \"Every 3rd hit on an enemy champion deals 180-270 bonus damage\"  and then go support that mechanic with a cool hit effect and stacking particles.  I guarantee you the offensive portion of Ali ult will start feeling a lot better for 2 reasons:\n1. The ceremony and oomph around the 3rd hit will make it feel exciting and POWERFUL\n2. The first and second hits will feel better, even though they individually are dealing less damage, because they now have tension and build up associated with them.  Each one is getting you closer to that 3rd super hit.\n\nAs a side note, I also like 3-hit passives because they give the champions that have them extended repeatable combat patterns that make them feel good about fighting forever.  Perfect for a champion like Vi who JUST WANTS TO PUNCH THINGS ALL DAY.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nYes, Thunderlord's was originally proposed by me, but Stashu and Squad5 were the ones doing most of the design thought, tuning, and implementation.  I was most involved on the keystones in the resolve tree (Grasp of the Undying, Strength of Ages, and Bond of Stone).","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2015-12-20T14:15:37.455+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The thing about 3 hit passives is....they're overdone.

In your Alistar example, an enemy who is aware of the AD bump might not feel super threatened by it on every hit. However, if they see the passive slowly building and they are about to eat the third hit, they may blow a flash or other movement ability to escape and deny it. It creates more interaction between both players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aiko Umesawa","date":"2015-12-20T05:38:28.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, is the next champion you are working on a void creature?

An assassin killing squishies is difficult to some degree since the squishies are always hiding behind a tank line and actively trying to avoid them.  Zed wrecks Jinx, but he has to figure out HOW TO GET TO HER.  Tanks on the other hand are always right there, ready to get bopped.

Keep up the good work man/woman, whatever you are, you're doing a great job so far!\n\n1) After the string of complex releases we've had for the last year and a half (Gnar, Azir, Kalista, Rek'sai, Bard, Ekko, Kindred) The Virtuoso was deliberately designed to be quite a bit more accessible when it comes to mechanics.  Note that \"accessible\" does not mean \"lacking in depth\" or \"something you've played before.\" He's neither of those.  On the gameplay difficulty spectrum, I anticipate him being way easier than Azir, way harder than Garen, and somewhere in the middle between Jinx and Ekko.\n\n3) Yeah, we have access to a lot of data about champions and whatnot which helps when you're drafting in ranked and trying to decide what items to buy.  Not really a \"riot only\" advantage though because of all the scraper sites out there. Their data isn't as accurate but it's usable.  \n\nI also know the inner workings of a lot of champs (like {{champion:254}} ).  Means I got to exploit all the black magic I scripted into her from day 1 >:)  (like her Q vacuuming minions and her E extending her attack range!)  Plus, it's cool to play champs, find something that feels off or buggy about them, and be like \"I'll go into the office and fix that\" (have a bard buff coming out this patch that's a result of that).\n\nGlad you like the champs I worked on :) Ty","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-01-08T15:55:33.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"BAAAAARD BUFFF","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Orisi","date":"2015-12-20T05:39:53.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main, I have to say your champs are some of the few that make me enjoy going out of my cherished role even when I suck with them.

We tend to swing pretty hard in various directions when making champion lineups and that is something we're trying to smooth out.  Ideally we get a good mix of things that scratch different player itches throughout the the year.  Guys, girls, monsters, simple kits, complex kits, grim-dark, lighthearted, etc.\n\nIt's hard though to get it right.  Heh, during my time at riot some of the trends we've seen pop up have been:\n\n* Dudepocalypse (Varus, Draven, Darius, Jayce - all grim dark men)\n* Boobpocalypse (Zyra, Diana, Syndra, Elise - all grim dark women with the same body type)\n* Too many monsters (VK, Gnar, Azir, Kalista, Rek'sai, - string of \"monstrous\" champs without many more normal humans)\n* How do I hold all these mechanics (Gnar, Azir, Kalista, Rek'sai, Bard, Ekko - string of champions with a lot of weird new mechanics that aren't all that easy to pick up and play)\n* Year of the myth (Bard, Tahm, Kindred - string of \"mythical\" champions that you can't really imagine walking down a street in runeterra)\n\nNow all these characters arguably are pretty great on their own, it's when we string them together that we start to worry.  Not everyone likes playing Yasuo, so if all the champs you release in a year play like Yasuo you're letting down a lot of your player base who isn't into that.

Seems like he has clear strength and weaknesses and obvious reasons to be picked/passed over for a given game.  That's good :)\n\nI do wish he was a little less hardcountery to certain low mobility melee champs.  I didn't really account for the fact that he likes building straight tank in a lot of games which tends to negate a lot of mini Gnar's weaknesses (he's supposed to be easy to kill).\n\nAlso wish he was a tad easier to play for the average player.  I'm really happy with his kit and how it all flows together, but he has a very appealing thematic that attracts a subset of players who would likely prefer not to have to deal with the complex movement and timing games I ask of him.  I get a little sad whenever I hear someone talk about how they buy all his skins because OMFG THEY'RE SO ADORABLE but then never play the champ cause he's too weird.  \n\n* TLDR - if you're making a guy who's twice as cute as Teemo you probably shouldn't also make him twice as hard to be effective with.\n\nGnar stories...hmmmmm...he was honestly pretty straightforward for me on the design side.  He did go through two designers though. Meddler made the first half his kit (transform mechanic, boomerangs/boulders, and hop) before handing the rest off to me when he didn't have time to work on him anymore after being promoted to Lead Champ Designer.  I added in the 3-hit passive (duh), ultimate, and really dug into what it meant to be in each form.  Mini Gnar was originally melee and used a tiny little version of Nautilus as a temp model with super sped up animations.\n\nFav Gnar skin is Gentleman.  I love the white hair and top hat.  All his skins are freaking sweet though.  Toats adorbs.","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2015-12-20T00:50:19.390+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've sort of wondered: Since going straight tank kind of negates his intended 'easy to kill' weakness as mini Gnar (On top of keeping him alive longer to pump out his sustained %health damage), would you consider implementing something like an iteration of the old Soraka Rework passive. \n\nFor a while, they toyed with giving Soraka a straight conversion on armor/mr (i.e., a 100 armor item would be effectively 80 armor and 20 AP for Soraka). Would you consider having something like this for Mini Gnar (Say, X% less bonus armor/mr while mini, but X% more bonus armor/mr while mega) or would you want to find a more clever way to go about it?\n\nNot that I think he's unbalanced or anything, just I'm wondering if it's worth it to keep his intended 'squishy mini form' weakness relevant even after he's bought some tanky items, and his low base stats don't matter quite as much.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Speaking personally, I LOVE the semi-involuntary transformation! It definitely gives him a feel that absolutely no other champion has or can really replicate (Which I love in my champions), and the stark contrast between his two forms (\"Squishy, mobile, sustained damage kiter\" and \"Tanky, slow, bursty engager\") makes it better for me. It means I have to keep on my toes at all time over when I have to transform or not and change up my strategies according. \n\nIt also makes me have to think about matchups a little more than I would otherwise because, for the most part, what one form may struggle with may be easy for the other. \n\nYeah I still get frustrating parts like \"Gah! Like one more rage and I could have gone Mega and lived\" or \"I WILL JUMP IN AND UL-oh wait I'm tiny RETREAT RETRE -ded-\", but the high points make it worth it for me. \n\nAnd yes, I even like his little mini-games: I definitely feel what you're going with for the three-hit passive, and the mini-games with his various Q's cement his playstyle for each form: Mini form Q goes back to you (And it goes farther back than where you threw it), so you can keep casting it on the run to kite. While Mega's Q, it initially acts as a way for you to catch up to your opponent and, when you're there, keep them pinned down while you tear them apart.\n\n---\n\nSo if Nautilus was the mini-form placeholder model, was there a Mega form placeholder model? (Please tell me it was a giant Teemo to contrast things)\n\n---\n\nWeirdly enough, I think gentlemen Gnar is the only skin I don't care much for: I think it's just because I picture Gnar as this hyperactive little kid who, like most kids, would hate having to wear a stuffy suit. Because of that the other skins (Gnar pretending he's a huge dinosaur monster, or playing in the snow and having a snowball fight) feel a lot more fitting to me. I do like the Jekyl and Hyde reference on Gentlemen though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-12-20T19:37:02.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the other guy.
