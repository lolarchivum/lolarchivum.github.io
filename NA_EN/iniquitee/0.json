Rather than rush a fix out the door, we are going to take due diligence to maintain the integrity of the game and release Kindred (all fixed up) next patch, once it has had adequate coverage. Until that time I hope Worlds can sustain your hype train. We really can't wait to get this champ in your hands and see what you can do with them. They are (still) coming!","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-10-05T19:02:23.390+0000","up_votes":280,"down_votes":6,"body":"Acceptable, but only under the condition you releases videos of whatever hilarious bug is causing Kindred to be delayed.\n\nDoes she do less damage on purple side?

This means you cannot use W or proc your E. Pretty bad stuff. As for why we don't hotfix - checking in and verifying a fix takes several days. By that time we would be very close to 5.20. I know a few days means a lot and may seem worth it, but there are a ton of huge costs involved in doing a patch, including kicking players out and forcing them to patch, sometimes in the middle of a game (if they disconnect for any reason, for example), and many other costs that may be invisible to you.
