Yeah, we&#039;ve gotten some comics, we keep getting the short stories with the champs, and those are great. But how long has it been since the last comic? Ryze was the last one four months ago? Burning Tides was roughly 3 years ago along with that Harrowing story if I recall. To my memory, we haven&#039;t gotten a big, base lore story for quite some time. We&#039;ve gotten stuff like Star Guardian, which is fine, but it&#039;s not the same.\r\n\r\nThe only thing keeping me anchored to League right now is the art department, certain skins that come out, and the lore of League. While the art department never really fails, skins can heavily be hit or miss to me, and lore/stories just come out too slowly. It&#039;s almost painful to wait for what the next big event is in the world and short stories for champ&#039;s updated bios and new champs can only do so much.\r\n\r\n&quot;BuT RiTo iS JuST a SmoL Indi-CoMPanY&quot;, BULLSHIT! Riot has been around for nearly 12 years and how big are they at this point? Still roughly a few hundred people? I don&#039;t think so. They are running one of the most popular games, maybe most popular MOBA (debatable for another day), around and they don&#039;t have the resources to maybe hire a few extra writers or artists to maybe come out with a better stream of comics and short stories? \r\n\r\nWhy not start looking into novels? They could easily start building more of the world that way with tales from various people and characters created for these stories, not necessarily the champs that we all know in the game. It&#039;d be interesting to read more about the life of a Demacian and how they make act around from someone outside their country, a Noxian soldier whose slowly is seeing the flaws of their nation and the struggles they get with that knowledge, the viewpoint of an Ionian in the middle of their home being torn by invaders but also extremists, maybe even a swash-buckling Bilgewater character and just have him go on stories of adventure across Runeterra. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s just a lot of potential that can happen here that Riot can jump on. League already is losing its touch as a game to me but as a series of stories or comics I&#039;d be down for more. That&#039;s just my thoughts and opinions anyway, I don&#039;t know. Just needed to get this off my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2018-11-13T22:01:20.456+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Because they are still trying to figure out the lore.

Did he see her as a yordle or no? Meanwhile we have Mordekaiser seeing through Viegar's glamour like it was nothing, presumably because of his power, or maybe, his thirst for magic or power was very much the same as Viegars, matching the values of Viegar, hence revealing the shroud? \n\nI do think your theory makes sense in one form of it, as the folk who tresspassed on Kled's territory won't see Kled the same as someone else, like Riven who shares (shared) many of the Core noxian traits, and them being in a public job meaning that they need to remain a single appearance by multiple people.

They might go to places because they seek out like minded people (like we all do) but not in a way that it takes from their character.\n\nFor Glamour, Poppy was able to walk among loads of people without anyone giving her a second glace in her comic, many of those people were warriors and 'heroes', all Demacian. For Jinx, Ziggs says straight after \"Wait, She's Crazy.\" Indicating a unsound mind can be twisted enough to see through because of their view on the world. Morde was powerful enough the innate magic in Glamour wasn't even a problem for him but the other people Veigar was with at the time, even though they were attuned to magic, didn't see through it.

The Yordles gravitate to where *Their* ideals matter, or are akin to the Culture of the area. Heimerdinger is still genius because he's a genius, he simply blends in best in Piltover, because that it the nation of innovation and invention.
