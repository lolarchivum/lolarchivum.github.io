That strategy is dead as far as we are aware, and that change is no longer necessary.

Yi goes in once at least 1 enemy is half-HP, so he could work with his alpha-resets.\n\nWhat you propose \"group up\" is useless as he won't go in for untill your team gets smashed by tank and your ranks will get in all directions.

That is very hard to pull off on the fly, and is part of the skill expression of playing conqueror Yi so in my opinion it is justified. Lethal Tempo and PTA Yi are nowhere near the sheer amount of damage output by conqueror Yi, except LT against full squishy team.\n\nAbout lots of autos to kill a squishy, the thing is it is a hell lot of wuju procs over about 1 second if he goes in stacked, it's likely going to be a nuke. However, again, that requires stacking. Agree about orb walking, it's hard to do at 2.5 AS.\n\nOverall, I actually think he's just right now. He was weak during preseason when the only viable build was crit which was literally invalidated by tabis. Now on-hit is back as a reliable build, and he can actually scale lategame now compared to the pressure of having to snowball. Games still last too short for that though, that said.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jack Frost","date":"2018-10-02T19:52:45.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello mr cowsep.

What tools do I have in Master Yi's kit to gank enemy lanes? What do I do when enemy ganks me? I personally would like to see Master Yi as duelist and teamfighter and less farming oriented\n\n---\n\nAnd exactly what makes you better player when you are managing your mana better? If you are not using your abilities you will get shit tons of harass from laning opponents. \n\nNo one will allow you to stay on lane and farm. You will use Alpha Strike to clear minion wave then enemies will throw all their abilities on you and die. You need to be more mindful of your laning opponent than clearing minions wave. You should know pretty well that you save Alpha Strike to counter other champions abilities\n\nOn other hand there are champions like Gnar that also harass you alot with ranged attack and Boomerangs. In that case you are not allowed to farm so you must use Alpha Strike to fight Gnar and use the damage advantage that you have against him. So you are forced to use Alpha Strike more often. Same goes with Lissandra that forces you to use Alpha Strike against her more often. So mana costs reduction comes in handly quite alot for laning Yi. Champions have abilities and should rely on them\n\n For a jungle YI mana cost is not a problem even if it was 70-110 because of mana regenerating that provides from the jungle item. For Top Yi however this is huge deal. Up until now I was forced to use mana runes just to be able to stay on lane for longer. Not to mention that there are lots of champion that either have low mana costs or champion with high resource regeneration or resourceless champion who on top of that spam their abilities. Meanwhile Yi mains who play Laning Yi have to deal with insane mana costs of 70-110.\n\nSo while i am trying to farm in melee form I have to deal with other champions of spamming abilities while my Alpha Strike costs 110 mana. Take Yi vs Gnar for instance. Not only Gnar is harassing you from distance but he also spams boomerangs whenever it is off cooldown.\n\nFor me mana cost reduction improved lane sustain quite alot. I am able to fight my opponents much frequently without relying mana runes. The miss of bonus damage to minions is not issues for me.

Ever been ganked top lane then put so far behind while the enemy Fiora steam rolls a game? More likely to happen when your jungler is Yi and they have an Elise. Individually he can be a very strong 1v1 champion (if given the feed and opportunity) but in most situations when you apply it in an actual game with equally skilled opponents he does not come out on top.\n\nThe fact that you used Zoe as an example of why Yi is an overly powerful champion tells a lot about your approach of the game, and why you will most likely stay in an elo that Assassins can terrorize.\n\nAlso yes, I'm glad you thought ahead, we don't need to call you a bad silver player because you clearly you know you are.\n\n---\n\nAlso for anyone that wants to check his profile just to get a glimpse at his frame of reference he is in Silver 5 and he is a Zoe main.
