His lack of mobility, single target damage, and cc being so delayed make him really bad at team fighting and his only warden ability in teamfights takes his ally out of the actual fight and puts him at risk of just being Cced and dying with his ally ( you ate your adc? Great, now blitz got a 2 for 1 special). Braum and Rakan can buff allies, have strong aoe cc, and  have mobility. Taric can buff your team to stupid amounts while having an aoe stun. Thresh has very strong cc including a hook, and also gives his allies an escape which is also a shield. Tahm doesn't buff his allies in anyway with his kit and can only take them out of a fight. To make up for Tahms lack of aoe, his inability to buff allies, his lack of mobility, him having to hit someone 3 times as an immobile melee champ before he can cc them (and his stun as a melee champ is a skill shot that is useless in a minion wave), Tahm instead has strong durability with his e ( which can be stopped by CC'ing him when he is low and before he shields), a long range teleport ult (which means that his lv 6 is weak) that lets him bring one ally that is highly telegraphed ( allows enemy to run away well in advance or lets enemies like Vickor to set up abilities) and can be stopped by damage, which is mostly good for swapping between objectives and catching enemies out of position or split pushing, and he has strong DUELING abilities that mostly scale with his health ( which he would have to sacrifice stoneplate, locket, banner, and zz rot for) so that his SINGLE target damage and the pressure of his global ult isn't useless.                                         Tahm does do some crazy damage in duels when he gets stacks on you and is strong against durable enemies ( unless they stack mr), but he isn't going to be beating any  duelists, he won't be able to engage on you unless he hits his q, fighting in your minions will let you outplay his q stun easily and he can't spit you away from your minions and get all his stacks up in time to stun you b4 you get back to your minions, dashing away before his damage ramps up should let you win trades, and anywhere else he will win because you probably beat him in aoe damage in team fights or something. If you are upset because it seems like tahm does more in team fights by denying damage with his devour, then remember that the enemy team probably has at least 2 squishes to try to kill and if tahm is close enough to either one your team focuses, then the 3 are bunched up enough that champs like Annie would insta win the teamfight.                                                       Tahm gives up a lot in being so strong in duels and without his strong ramp up damage and having stickiness without mobility that can feel bad as a melee who isn't a skirmisher or maybe another juggernaut, Tahm would be complete garbage and only another rework would fix him as a who's ult would be near useless without having any kill pressure behind it, and would be a devour bot that is hard to kill in team fights, and would be useless in Botlane against the engage supports that he is supposed to counter and the mobile enchanters who he can't stop from running away from him. If you nerf his devour damage, then he would never actually eat an enemy except to maybe move a juggernaut away from his team which is just a really bad and slow knock back and buffing his early or late game devour damage would just let him stupid damage at that point and if you buffed how fast he can move during devour, then tahm would just be stupid near towers, if you nerf his scaling health damage passive when supports are already low on health then his dueling damage will be gone and he will lose against all of the engage supports in Botlane, touching his q damage would make his poking either stupid in Botlane or useless and tahm wouldn't want to interact with the enemy at all except for all ins, his slow on his q is tahms only instant way to catch any enemy and he would be useless against enchanters and celerity adcs  without it and is his only way Slow down melees running for his adcs. His e has already been nerfed heavily and he has slow base health regeneration for a tanky champion, it gives him no actual in combat sustain, and his shield only lasts 3 seconds.                                                                       Sorry for the rant, but the last patch hit tahm kench hard and I'm not sure what you would nerf as Tahm Kench actually gives up a lot for his ramp up damage and stickiness and there isn't much you could compensate with him that wouldnt either make him broken in Bot lane or make him garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-03-07T06:11:40.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sir/madam, I would kiss you if we met in person.
