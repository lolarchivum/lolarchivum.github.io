His kit looks way less awkward while still keeping some iconic elements like the corrosive charge lock-on, a shield on W (even if it's tied to a brand new ability), and his sick new ult being a sort of spiritual successor to his old one but a million times more fitting. His new skins are all drop dead gorgeous. I mean, crabgot went from a laughing stock to a terrifying kaiju for god's sake. \n\nThe only thing really left to discover other than actually playing him is his new voice. Unlike most older champions I thought Urgot's voice actually sounded decent despite having tragically few lines. The pained, gargle-y sound of them really suited him and definitely wouldn't be out of place on new Urgot either, so I really have my fingers crossed for something similar.
