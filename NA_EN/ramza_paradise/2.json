If you run at kalista and she jumps away, you turn around and fight her team instead of chasing. She jumps further when jumping away, so she now has to waste time walking back into the teamfight since she hopped out of AA range.\n\nIf they go that stupid hurricane build, just having a tank run at her until she hops away then turning around is actually a decent way to keep her impact at a minimum. The build lacks heavy single-target damage, and Kalista doesn't have a steroid outide her W proc, which does magic damage. So she actually has a hell of a time actually killing a tank that doesn't just chase her endlessly.\n\nStill would not recommend taking Garen vs. her.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-02-22T20:29:54.261+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"No my friend, *you* missed *my* point.\n\n> Real Kalista mains woulda **maintained the max range distance** since it is further than Darius' pull range and you can easily outhop Garen's Q MS.\n\nAka stayed in range at max range aka stayed in the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-02-23T09:35:18.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the point isnt a good one. \n\nokay -  she kites back and  is out of the fight. then you turn back on the enemy team. \n\nbut a good kalista wont jump STRAIGHT backwards. she kites from side to side. you turn back? great!
