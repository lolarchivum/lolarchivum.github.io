Mandatory service pay little exept if there are special conditions (like many siblings or guardian of the family). And still it is a raise from 5 to 30 euros. While needing at least 50 per month for when you go out. Yippe kay ye.\n\nSecond of all. You dont learn teamwork or team-building. On the contrary you learn to hide from responsibilities as much as possible. Let someone else take the responsibility or the blame. Teamwork is a blatant myth, everyone try to spend their time doing as less as possible. And you cant really blame them. Mandatory service is like a tax you pay in time.\n\nThird. You learn few essential skills for your life. Most of the work you do are the simplest everyday jobs. Like cleaning everything over and over again. Most of the stuff you already know how to do or at least you would learn anyway in the months you are drafted. As for the physical training, being done by people that dont know what to do will often lead to burnouts. I would rather have someone with experience giving me a route i could follow twice a day instead of feeling exhausted for two days after that.\n\nExpanding to point three. Unless you fall under certain exceptions (doctor electrician plumper and cook being the most obvious) you wont excersise your education. It was sad seeing people with degrees on lookouts and patrols.\n\nAs you can see mandatory service is not something pleasant for someone not caring to join the army.
