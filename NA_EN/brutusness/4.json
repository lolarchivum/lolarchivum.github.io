What I just hope for is that his next one tips more on the fact that he's a dangerous demon and less on him having a funny appearance. There have been a bunch of ideas that lean towards this from artists, which I'll leave below.\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/219/632/large/leon-ropeter-tahm-1.jpg?1504558694\r\n\r\nNot exactly \"serious\" per say, but it still retains a creepier appearance.\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/594/792/large/fredrik-hagg-darkstartahmkench.jpg?1499798055\r\n\r\nThis one just works, given the nature of black holes as eternally hungry for everything, and Tahm's own need to feed.\r\n\r\nhttps://img00.deviantart.net/b166/i/2015/301/2/9/void_world_eater__tahm_kench_sketch_by_wesnothas-d9ejhfd.jpg\r\n\r\nSimilar to Dark Star, but with a slightly more animalistic and alien feel.\r\n\r\nOne more, that's a bit more my own personal idea, is Candy King Tahm Kench. While it doesn't sound that serious based on the name or immediate appearance, like Ivern's, it's based on Tahm himself looking to eat everything, fitting into his overall theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-01-25T22:51:59.882+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I'd love to see a skin for Kench where he's settled into one of the other regions of Runeterra - like if Tahm Kench had been around during the height of the Shuriman civilization, what could he have looked like in that culture?

Xayah is a hipster, yes, but not any of this. Someone who'd make a fantastic Queen of Hearts would be Camille. She has the haughty attitude, she's very arrogant, and always speaks down to those not in her social class.
