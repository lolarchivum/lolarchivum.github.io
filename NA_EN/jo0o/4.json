It's a great move.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":252,"down_votes":46,"body":"So, I have only been playing a couple months, but I was warned that the community could be rough, and boy, was that right. League has a serious problem with toxic players. I have relatively thick skin thanks to several years of playing other online games, but even I get occasionally blindsided by a player&#039;s words to the point where I&#039;m actually shaken or disturbed. \r\n\r\nSuspensions and even bannings seem to have only moderate impact. People are capable of making new accounts, and indeed often have several active. Perhaps they&#039;re confident they can avoid punishment. Perhaps they&#039;re prepared for it. I&#039;m not sure. It&#039;s like how, in the US justice system, mandatory minimum sentencing laws are frequently demonstrated to not actually reduce crime.\r\n\r\nBut now? You hit potentially toxic individuals at their bottom line. I now get to enjoy products that they can&#039;t get. For MONTHS. You made being a player in good standing something that truly matters, and you even had the balls to make this determination retroactive, so that somebody punished a month before Hextech Crafting went live that wasn&#039;t considered &quot;reformed&quot; still can&#039;t participate. I love it. It&#039;s a master stroke.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy for you to make this new content available for everybody, but you guys have shown real vision and guts to take a stance against the toxic players within this community. I have high hopes for Hextech Crafting to make a real dent in the numbers of people willing to ruin the game for others.
