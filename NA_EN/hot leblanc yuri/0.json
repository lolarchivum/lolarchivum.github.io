Its happened to me, its happened to just about everyone.  You can reduce this by only clicking one move order when near or inside of a wave, something that I have to consciously think about, as myself and everyone I know who plays this game clicks several thousand times more then they really need to during the course of a match.\n\nWhat really bugs me about creep block and creep behavior is creep block overwhelmingly hurting melee champs compared to ranged ones.  A ranged champ pokes a melee champ when they are near/in a wave, they take a sliver of health in return from creep autos.  A melee champ attacks an enemy champ in/near a wave and the wave thrashes them for the gall to attack someone near them.\n\nThe other thing is creeps autoing an opposing creep, you waiting for it to be in range for an auto to cs, and then at the last second a minion either stops targetting that minion, or a new one targets it in addition to the ones who already were.
