The client won't leave the authenticating screen, but people see us logged in.\n\nWe have a situation where:\n1) accounts theoretically with less skins (i.e. low level accounts/smurfs) seem to have no trouble.\n2) accounts' online status at the time of disconnection seem to be irrelevant (both parties are affected)\n3) Friends are able to see us as online when we are on the \"Authenticating screen\".\n\nTo expand on point 3, the client even acts as though we have been logged in. For example, when we are on authenticating in the background and browsing the internet with google chrome as the active tab, the client flashes orange at a point as if to say something is happening, but then when you click the tab, nothing is going on, its still authenticating.\n\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"YouGotCerved","date":"2017-11-21T16:02:47.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I notice a pattern on these forums that people (such as myself) were logged in and got booted for maintenance are having issues with only those accounts.
