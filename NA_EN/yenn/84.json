We had jgl oriented meta when season started,shifted from mid lane meta,shifted from top lane meta,which is now bottom lane oriented. Regarding climbing, you will get your elo with your main role,even if meta doesnt focus on that role. I came to my peak rank (or up to 150 mmr below) with 3 different roles on 3 different accs. You can play jungle,mid or top,and still carry games and get your elo. And maybe if ur main sup and only played janna last month,you will get up to 200 more mmr (around 3 divisions) because its strong pick,but eventualy, that kind of player will probably fall of by that same 200 mmr he gained by playing strong pick,in time. \nI dont think game is unfair or completly reliant on botlane,and I do think that you can carry and get your Elo with any role. \n\nP.S.
