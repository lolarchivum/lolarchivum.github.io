Despite having hawkshot, nobody realized what was going on until it was too late. \n\nWith optimal team play, Ashe would scout the jungle for Rengar. Your jungler would interpret the hawkshot info to realize what side of the map rengar could be on, think what plays he could make from there, and move the counter them, while mid wards the bot side of the lane so he can scream bloody murder when A. Sol moves to gank.\n\nSince this is likely solo queue, let's ignore that scenario. With optimal individual play, the situation can still be salvaged. At level 4, a tower isn't something you just brush off. If a dive lasts longer than expected, you will have casualties. You likely had enough CC (Exhaust, frost shot, Dazzle) that you could force them to tank more tower shots than they can survive, and you have enough sustain (Heal, Starlight, Bastion, Colossus, Warlords) that you can survive a decent bit longer than they might expect. One or both of you are still going to die most likely, but you definitely could have taken Rengar down with you at the very least. Your jungle and mid could rotate topside to punish or take the unattended mid tower. Your top could also TP down to respond.\n\nNow, since this is a plat game, let's ignore that. After the trainwreck that just happened, you should ask your top laner for a lane swap. Without a T1 tower, you can't safely farm as Ashe, and a bruiser/tank is likely better able to hold down the fort against the nightmare poke of Varus+Sona than a squishy, immobile marksman.\n\ntl;dr The enemy was proactive, and your team collectively failed to respond.","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2017-10-13T11:43:00.260+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":14,"body":"That's not even the point.\n\nThe point is that laning phase shouldn't end so abruptly and the so called \"macro\" play shouldn't be to just clusterfuck the botlane every single game.\nWin bot win game, and stuff like that.\n\nEven watching the LCS you realise how everything goes around the botlane, even when there are many star midlaners and toplaners around.\n\nTowers are made of paper - fact.\nThey go down too easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-10-13T13:31:55.846+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":14,"body":"Yes they should.

It's up to the enemy team to recognize that things have changed and adapt and respond. Riot is not required to enforce a specific method of gameplay for you. You as a player should be reacting to the enemy team's movements and decisions with your own movements and decisions. \n\nIn this situation, the best thing to do would be to have the top laner TP to a minion and the top laner, jungler and mid laner hard push mid while the four man is happening. Since you have no champions to kill, you probably get the turret faster even through Fortification (level 4 in bot lane is close to 5 minutes anyway which is when Fortification turns off).

A proactive Sona with mana to spare would likely blow through spells to proc that q to chunk down the tower.\nAdd Sol's free waveclear (the guy only needs to position while firing aa's at tower) and Rengar....\n\nI'm going to assume one of two things happened here. Either Aurelion Sol and Rengar stole tower while you were respawning and going back to lane, or all 4 of them were hammering at your tower. In this case, you've gotta understand. Even before 5 minutes, 4 champs(generally) have enough waveclear and damage to push their minions on your tower constantly, therefore granting them uninhibited ability to take tower.\n\nIf its that big of a deal and becomes overly common in games ( I doubt it will ) then there could be another pre-5 buff to towers, granting them partial damage immunity if the tower doesn't have a champ near to defend. If there's 4 enemies on bot, then there would need to be 3 there to cancel this buff.(I'm bad at explaining it but it makes sense in my head)\n\nOtherwise, You just got outplayed.  You'd need to better sync with your team on this part. Restating previous advice given. Ashe should have scouted for Rengar, you should have maintained a minimum of 2 wards at all times, and top could have TP'd to bot. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this situation was balanced in terms of numbers. If they want to abandon their lanes and positions to dive early tower, then thats ok. Your team should counter by assaulting the empty towers and positions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2017-10-13T12:49:24.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"How did you get dove with a taric.\n\nIve gotten triple kills from people diving me with blitz and im just a shit silver player.\n\nThat an easy 2-3 person stun while the tower destroys them.\n\nUnless you mean dove as in.\n\n\"We were way overextended at 30% life with no wards #bufftowers\"","replies":[{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2017-10-13T13:04:34.189+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"or maybe you gotten triple kills **precisely** because you're Silver and the players diving you don't know how to execute it properly because they're...
