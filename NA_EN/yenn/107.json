I don't understand what people don't get about that.  How is it okay for him to die with 0 counterplay.  Like to me that's the problem with this game entirely.  They claim ok we have to nerf marksmen because they do too much damage and it's unfair.  So they nerf them and now most of them suck unless they get 3-4 items yet some champs just take their place deleting you in 1 seconds with minimal counterplay yet the champs doing it now have more mobility and more gap closers and more survivability.  I mean if champs that can engage from 1 screen away can do it then there's 0 reason that marksmen shouldn't be able to still.","replies":[{"poster":"Anags","date":"2018-07-03T16:14:29.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Burst has existed in this game similar to this for quite some time.  \n\nAnd even when it wasnt burst it was being killed with no recourse.\n\nAt a certain point you are bitching about league being league.

The cooldown on it is far longer than Nocturne's combo.  Realistically all it does is let you revive once every 5 minutes when you get deleted.  By the time you generally build it, the game has progressed far enough that this usually means that it's ready 1/3 (or at best) 1/2 the time you need it.  Even then, it's not really counterplay either.  For a one-shot combo like the OP demonstrates, you're knocked out of combat and your team is left fighting a 4v5 for 4 seconds.  By then it might be decided and you as likely as not are just going to revive to die again. \n\nAs for glass cannon champions, a lot of the time they don't really have any other options.  Their kits bring no utility and they rely on scaling their damage.  GA and Zhonya's are the only defensive items most ADC or mages can really afford to build.  \n\nEven more ridiculous, however, is how even tanks aren't really building defensive effectively anymore.  With the absurd amount of damage flying around these days, even a full-build tank is getting melted within seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-07-02T10:41:24.545+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"66 armor \n1600 HP.\n\nWonder's why he got 1 shot.\n\n\nEcks dee.\n\n\nLol at Rakan trying to W the dash.\n\nNocturne is unstoppable during the dash.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkone7001","date":"2018-07-02T14:27:30.506+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"That was not his point, his point was there was no counterplay to his ult. he is very aware and stated that he had no defenses, his point was Nocturne R'ed to him and had no way to counter it. he would be dead all the same even with armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2018-07-03T05:07:17.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The counterplay is stay near an ally and have them deal with noc, or have any armor item.
