If you see it hit zero Kbps, don't panic, you computer is doing computer things and isn't going to start downloading again until it finishes. If you feel like you have waited too long just try to switch to a different region again and see if that results in it resuming download (if not, your computer is doing computer things).\n\n3. complain to riot for making a patch update this large come out as one potato shattering chunk","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OST Yura","date":"2014-10-10T03:16:57.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not know if I am allowed to do this, but I have posted on Reddit with a temporary fix and a discussion on what may be causing this problem since patch 4.15: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2itjji/are_you_having_problems_with_your_lol_patcher_415/\nI would like to help you help us so please feel free to ask me more questions.

(Windows 7) Like over 15k+ files. I noticed that this is usually the cause when you are in the middle of patching and suddenly while patching, it drops to 0kps and you rage quit and exit the patcher. I honestly don't know what the problem is, but for me I believe it was just my internet and connection.. (trying to patch at school LOL) but I've read in recent forums that people have really good internet and have dropped to 0kps. While patching today, it was pretty steady until after 33%. It kept going from 0kps-300kps and then dying back down. I thought if I let it wait it would patch eventually. It did move at 0kps though. it moved 1% every 2 hours but I gave up after that. I'm not really sure the problem is for 0kps so I can't really help there.\n\nBut for the endlessly scanning files I discovered that if you delete some folders in the league folder. Deleting the stuff in (RADS/solutions) and the folder lol_launcher (RADS/projects) and then try patching again. It will probably take a while and it will continue to scan files. But I took note that the League of Legends folder is about 24k files. Check properties, and henceforth if you are scanning over 24k files, clearly something is wrong. I've had this issue before and and deleted the 2 things i mentioned earlier + lol_game_client (I believe, not quite sure) and left if over night to patch again. And when I woke up it was ready to go! It may scan for quite a while, couple o hours, then it whould be able to patch soo an extra half hour or so. I'm scanning right now and I'm at 12k files. Gonna leave it for the night and see the outcome tomorrow morning. I'll post if mines functional or not. \n\nNew to forums and stuff like this. >.< Sorry if this is too long, but I can tell this problem is cheezing a lot of people. Me too D: Hope this helps!\n\n**Update**I didn't leave it on for the night cause my computer went to sleep. So I had to resume it when I woke up. It finally finished! After 5 hours of scanning and patching. Jeeez. So it ended up scanning around 30k files for me. I don't get it but after that it started patching again... While it was patching, it dropped to 0kps a few times, but it got back up a bit later. Well, note is that DO NOT CLOSE YOUR CLIENT WHEN PATCHING. IT WILL HONESTLY **** IT UP.  Give it some time.
