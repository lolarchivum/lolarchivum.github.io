The game states allows one lane to get so snowballed that the other team has to surrender at 15 due to the 5-0 Fizz or Zed roaming and murdering every other enemy champion in one shot repeatedly with no counter plays or ability to take objectives. When the majority of the games have toxic players, people not caring whether or not they win, or just plain casuals, then you have to be THE ONE to get super fed early to carry the game. That does not happen unless you are an assassin or roaming AP mid or an objective controlling jungler like Udyr. \n\nYour rank is more dependent on teammates not feeding kills multiple kills during laning phase than it has ever been in the past because statistically your team is going to get crushed by 15 or 20 minutes due to one player's gold advantage. There is no coming back, especially if you are a bottom laner. You can win lane with a cs advantage and still get completely crushed by a fed enemy mid laner or jungler. You should have the ability to scale with a cs lead, but I feel like that has to do with lack of peeling supports and the rune benefits for assassins.\n\nThe more I type in this passage I realize there are so many problems with the game right.

That whole dev blog about trap games stinks. The post makes no effort to explain how comeback chance got quantified in the first place, the breakpoints are _super_ uneven, the threshold for \"even games\" does not correspond to the general perception (25% chance at a comeback isn't considered \"even\" by most people), and, at the very end of the day, it still proves everyone's suspicions. Not only are around a quarter of all games legitimately almost impossible to win by Riot's own standards, _more than half of **all** games aren't even close_. This is, again, using Riot's very generous divisions, and I'm sure the results would be even worse if the lower limit to \"even games\" were set at something more reasonable, like 40% or 35%. Riot has effectively proven that League is far, far too snowbally, as the literal absolute majority of all games do not offer a sufficient chance of a comeback, and a quarter of all games are the horrific stomps that have already been talked about so much. This is terrible.\n\nWhat's more, in spite of presenting us with these statistics, Riot _still_ tries to pull the wool over our eyes. The post's grand conclusion about there being \"a large increase\" in more even games is directly contradicted by the statistics at hand, unless one is willing to call a ~2% difference since 8.01 \"a large increase\". The post also conveniently fails to mention how this compares to previous seasons, namely Season 5 and before. This omission, plus the heavily exaggerated conclusion, and suspicious distribution of data all point to a deliberate attempt to try to mislead the playerbase into believing something other than the facts, whereas the poor presentation of the stats, the complete lack of explanation behind the numbers, and the lack of awareness of what the numbers directly convey all suggests that whoever was in charge of pushing this piece of propaganda to us players themselves lacked an adequate grasp of statistics. That post is a poor attempt at lying to the playerbase under the guise of communication, and is not the first time Riot has deliberately tried to mislead us using badly handled statistics. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes players lose trust in Riot, and that gives us reason not to trust them in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-07-25T20:13:26.284+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":6,"body":"If we assume that either team has a 50% chance to win at minute 0, how do you believe that percentage should change over the length of a game?

The continuous attempts through posts, videos and dev blogs to show that the game is \"fine\" and still yet to grow further, tangencing or half-answering critical topics such as snowball, Time-To-Kill, damage creep and playerbase drop doesn't help Riot solving the game's issue.\n\nI understand that, as a employee or leader, the last thing you want is to cause panic and share negativity or pessimism towards your game to the community.

Assuming both teams are equally matched, games should progress in such a way that there should _always_ be a meaningful chance at coming back at every stage. If there is no realistic chance for a team to win, the game should end right then and there, and should not require a surrender vote to do so. Again, this is only my opinion, but I do not consider a 25% comeback chance or below to be especially realistic, which is why it concerns me so much that over half of all games do not offer a sufficient chance at a comeback, and a quarter of all games over virtually no comeback chance at all.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6hhqhHkY,comment-id=00110001,timestamp=2018-07-25T20:13:26.284+0000)\n>\n> How much value should you get out of early game victories?\n\nWhy focus on the early game so much? If a champion wins the early game, they should be able to take a tower, set their opponent behind and/or roam to other lanes, all of which should give momentum, even if it should not in any way decide games then and there. If anything, early game victories should have the least defining impact relative to mid or late game victories, because early game victories influence how likely a team is to win in the mid and late game, due to how League rewards wins with raw combat power.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6hhqhHkY,comment-id=00110001,timestamp=2018-07-25T20:13:26.284+0000)\n>\n> Or how much should you lose from making mistakes?\n\nLeague should give room to make mistakes and take risks, and should not disproportionately punish them based on whichever arbitrary period of time one has chosen in the match. I don't speak for others, but I like the Dominion score model where the same action produces the same reward at all stages, and leads towards inevitable victory. SR could take a page from this kind of pacing, since currently it seems like Riot's way of accelerating the pacing of matches there has been to have each small victory generate far too large an advantage.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6hhqhHkY,comment-id=00110001,timestamp=2018-07-25T20:13:26.284+0000)\n>\n> How do champions who&#x27;s strength is in the early game get impacted if we don&#x27;t allow you to build up advantages? \n\nThat is for the balance team to decide for if these champions suffer.

You took no time to mention that the number of games with a below-25% comeback chance was something to improve upon, and in fact you did not even announce plans to continue improving on this. That post was all self-satisfaction and self-congratulation for a job well done: at best, this does not demonstrate particularly good awareness of how players as a collective have been feeling about the state of comebacks, and at worst it is a deliberate attempt at deceiving players into believing things are fine, in spite of data that shows otherwise.

No insight was given onto how Riot went about calculating comeback chance in games, or what a \"comeback chance\" represents (how do you define a comeback? When in a match does a comeback happen? Can this happen more than once per game?), and not even a single example was given of a factor that influenced comeback chance.

If you do not expect people to be able to read a graph, then why did you even choose one as the core of your presentation? Explaining yourself just a little more, as Riot had once done in the past to explain their design terminology, would not have harmed the approachability of your post. I don't know about you, but I'd also rather have a post that is slightly less approachable, but that at least makes sense, rather than one that looks nice to a wider audience while lacking in real substance.

This is the same kind of deceit under the guise of statistics as that dev post that used Vietnam to discuss the state of top lane in NA. What you are telling me about \"your view\" is that Riot apparently took a look at this graph, or whichever data behind it, saw that the absolute majority of their games had less than a one-in-four chance of producing a comeback, and is okay with this, as the company apparently once was with Dynamic Queue in similar posts.

The amount of wins i have because i didnt surrender is crazy. comebacks are very possible. if it was up too me there would be no surrender button at all, its toxic and creates more friction in a team instead of people focusing on teamwork they argue about surrendering. When you Q for a game you agree too a 30-50 minute commitment on average if you cant though through it don't Q up. Also fun fact how can one improve at making comebacks or playing from a behind position if they always forfeit hint hint , they wont.).

Bot lane can't 2v1 an enemy support one fight and they keep dying or being completely useless sitting afk farming by tower when they KNOW the entire enemy team is on other half of map and they should be hard-shoving to get enemy tier1 bot tower, but they don't. They flame, complain, and/or be useless for forever, then you get one fight where you convince them game is winnable and all of a sudden your vayne adc decides to try and is 2v4 getting a triple kill with your help. They didn't hit any powerspikes in levels or items since the last time they died 2v1 vs the enemy support, but now they can 2v4 kill 3 enemies INCLUDING said enemy support?

In these scenarios you are stuck in a game for 20 minutes (at the minimum) - sometimes because a troll refuses to give up, sometimes because half your team genuinely thinks that the statistics don't matter and the other team will make the infinitesimally small mistake that will break the game the other direction... quite possibly because that was the state of the game a year ago.  \n\nIf Riot created a more balanced approach to games that fall into that category to be forfeited at an earlier time, I think it would alleviate some of the pressure regarding this conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-07-24T22:29:29.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that is part of the consideration.
