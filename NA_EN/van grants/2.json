And I actually agree it should not have mana in the build path since mana is meant to be an early gating mechanism. To that end, I think it should build out of Brutalizer. Brut needs something besides Youmuu's to build into, and Essense Reaver seems like a great candidate.\n\nReplace the B. F. Sword with a Brutalizer, drop the AD to 50 (since very high AD with flat armor pen is a dangerous combination), give it 20 flat armor pen, and drop its price to something like 2850 so it stays gold efficient. Now you have an item that is reasonably rush-able to solve mana problems, but not TOO early, gives an alternative to Youmuu's for Brutalizer, and has stats that are very desirable for AD Casters, along with a build path that doesn't scare them off.

The multiplicative scaling means that you scale off of several stats, so if you don't have any of those stats, you deal a bunch less damage. Someone building defense, or utility, or anything other than most DPS as ADC is Doing It Wrong; meaning ER is going to be the Wrong Choice as long as this is the case. Adding in any of those stats other than raw AD (crit chance, attack speed, armor penetration) might make ER better, but it'd also probably overload the item and make it cost way too much\n\nB) By the time you can afford ER, you don't need it. Making it build out of a BF sword means that by the time you get the mana sustain, you're already past the stage where mana management is much of a concern. Sure, most ADCs can bleed themselves dry if they try, and some (Kog, Ez) might find themselves with not enough mana to do their job, but most ADCs can function without mana sustain because autoattacking costs nothing.\n\nIf ER is going to be a thing, it needs to be cheaper and ADCs need to be revamped so that they don't need to build all damage all the time in order to do their jobs.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-08-19T02:34:30.682+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ADCs are designed to do the most damage\n\nI don't see this as an ADC only item, even if on paper it suits them best.

It's a late-game item; when you have your zeal item, your IE, your LW, you need another 'lots of AD' item.
