His kit is powerful from a sheer number standpoint  however theres not a lot of room for some of the aspects highly valued on newer ability kits such as &quot;expression of skill/mastery&quot; or &quot;meaningful counterplay&quot; .just to clarify  I don&#039;t think Wukong is too strong or too weak I just think that a lot of his kit simply is not up to snuff compared to other champions. Wukongs skirmish pattern is very basic to the point that he is practically a sequence caster (E into close range land a Q to shred armor and get to spinning!). Everything is targeted more or less which really eliminates the room for interesting game elements .\r\n\r\nHis passive is largely uninteresting and is simply &quot;free stats&quot; .\r\n\r\nHis W skill and clone is very &quot;clunky&quot; in-game. If you already have minion aggro but create a clone minions will de-aggro and continue moving forward instead of immediately switching aggro to the clone\r\n\r\nW also used to be a great juke tool back when he first came out but now very keen players will realize when you use it due to a very subtle idle-reset animation that happens thus you are mostly relegated to using clone as a way to deny counter trades in lane or get a free stealthed initiation from around the corner very similar to Shaco. As salt on the wound just look at all the things {{champion:7}}  clone can do in comparison ! Walking at people, auto attacking AND mimicking spells? Could such technology not be incorporated into Wukongs W to make it a more impactful and believable skill\r\n\r\nE is a simple targeted gap closer more or less that grants attack speed. Sadly unlike the other gapclosers it doesn&#039;t interact with other champions or environment significantly . no resets on kill{{champion:39}} ,no snare stun or taunt {{champion:80}} {{champion:98}}  {{champion:89}}   no wall bouncing or traversing {{champion:245}} {{champion:164}} , not even a pitiful slow{{champion:5}}. Its just a gap closer plain and simple with a steroid on top. I guess its supposed to be semi-confusing due to the 2 clones he also sends out but they disappear immediately  and Wukong doesn&#039;t even flicker out on use so its really obvious which target he chose.\r\n\r\nR is his most powerful skill but falls to the same drawback many other &quot;channeled spin&quot; attacks that have existed on character in MOBAs over the years and that is the ever looming question of &quot;Am I putting out the most DPS I possibly can? Would simply auto attacking this person instead of spinning on them yield more DPS?&quot; For instance If I went full crit &quot;assassin Wukong&quot; you get really mixed feelings on this spell and tend to use it exclusively for a knock-up or to escape after a assassination attempt.  In other words this ultimate doesn&#039;t support all physical damage  focused builds equally.\r\n\r\nAnyways all in all I think Wukongs is Ripe with potential and He should be looked at.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-03T02:34:17.742+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd expect Wukong to be one of the prime candidates for an update when we do Divers.

The Warwick update is probably the biggest example at this point, since he's still one of the easiest junglers to pick up, if not the easiest, but even before that, Ashe got changes that made her competitively viable while keeping her simplicity, Taric was also kept relatively easy to play, and Jinx has had a pretty forgiving learning curve since her release.

Because you guys mentioned back around November that he would be getting light changes in the preseason or just after. That came and went, and it's now February. Having to go almost another year until next preseason with Aatrox feeling like he does is difficult for me to come to terms with. He's been my favorite champion for a long time now, and seeing him in such a sub-optimal state for so long is kind of disheartening.\n\nI know that its not so simple as snapping your fingers and suddenly a champion is better. Abilities are hard to come up with and balance, and I get that. But at the same time, how difficult would it be to increase base AD by 2 or HP by 20? Small stuff like that would be nice and I seriously doubt that it'd put him over the top. He has some of the lowest base stats of any champion, regardless of one who's supposed to be an initiator. I get that you don't want to change something and then go back and change it again, but...he needs something. He's a joke right now.

Also unlike other divers who have some form of sustain, Wukong only has his passive and his decoy to keep him safe in a team fight. That was fine back in earlier seasons, but anymore if you don't have some form of sustain to help you in lane against champs with pokes, you are practically a sitting duck during the lane phase.\n\nAs for his kit, his W definitely needs to feel more impactful. Most of the time getting hit by his W isn't as big as a punishment as other tricks in the game. A good example being how both {{champion:7}} and {{champion:35}}'s decoys can really punish you for attacking the wrong one. I think if the Decoy at least did basic attacks (even if it did no damage) to a target within its attack range it would at least serve as a better form of deception then it does currently.\n\nI thought of an idea for his E to make it like WW's Q, where it can be held to dash or pressed to send a 3rd decoy instead, but that's more for a thematic reason (don't really think it fits a Diver style honestly). Adding a bit more of that trickery and playfulness that Wukong is known for.\n\nHis Ult shouldn't change too much since it's his signature move, but I do think it needs to be tuned to fit along other divers. Something like \"if you hit a target with your Q before Ulting, that target deals reduced damage to you\" or something.\n\nI do agree he is a champ with a lot of potential and always has been. with a few changes here and there he could be one of, if not the most versatile champs in the game, supporting all kinds of builds and possibly be even better for new players then he is now, since his kit wouldn't punish you as hard for not building a certain way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CH0BBY","date":"2017-02-20T22:30:52.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you guys should just fix the hitbox on q and e and aatrox will be fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2017-02-05T03:43:57.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally love Wukong's kit the way it is.\n\nI agree the passive is lackluster and a lot of people try to force him into a tank role because of this, yet he plays more like an assassin.
