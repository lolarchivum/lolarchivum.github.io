And no, I'm not talking abut a blind just like Teemo or Quinn's Q, I was thinking of something like Graves W since Veigar E resembles a black hole, and maybe when they are inside of the box they can't see the borders! so this way maybe they will get stunned... unless they kindly stop moving!\n\nWell, Thats all I got to say folks.

This was due to a 0.25 second animation that's always played before the spell casts (or in 5.4, begins to cast). So now his delay is getting reduced to 0.75, as the animation is now included in the delay. So really it's much more of a correction than a buff.

Come late game, a 180 dmg difference is nothing.\n\nThat being said, and while I would like to see the delay on his W lowered, I feel that as long as his q is a skill shot, this is a bad idea. Simply put, if riot continues this trend for veigar, they are going to drastically alter his core identity as a **single-target** burst mage in favor of a more homogenized **poke** mage. And an inefficient one at that. If I want a poke/zone control mage, why would I pick veigar when I could pick Xerath or ziggs? \"but veig has teh dmgz\" Oh really? Why wouldn't I just pick syndra then?

Not really. The delay is the same, 0.75s. What you're talking about is the *animation delay*, and that's a huge difference.

It's now a stun that only stuns people if they stand still or (for some reason) decide to run into it. It's become less of a stun and more of a cage. So, Veigar's E now allows Veigar to trap an enemy and force them to fight him 1v1 at close range…which does not usually end very well for tiny little Veigar. This is precisely what used to happen when you missed a stun: the most likely outcome was that the other mage would delete poor Veigar, though sometimes you would blow each other up.\n\nMaybe hitting someone with Q inside your cage should stun them. Maybe W should have reduced cooldown inside the cage. Maybe amp up damage inside the cage (but not for people who run into the walls), making opponents decide between trying to dodge skillshots inside the cage or taking one guaranteed rotation at normal damage (\"double or nothing\").

Works for Annie, and it would be a smaller circle, so everyone can stop crying. Easier to land for us, same effect as others have (as passives, no less), and more dead bodies. It can still be used to shut down some of the #LCSBIGPLAYS characters.. oh, right. Nevermind. \n\nBeen trying to play him the last couple days, and it is horrible. His ring can't keep him safe, it can't engage. Just a way to dump mana before you get nuked all to hell by someone.\n\nEdit: The ring needs to be altered or replaced. How they have it now is just worthless. I cast the ring with Soraka in the middle of the cast. Wasn't trying to stun her, as that is impossible now. It is just a really poor imitation of J4's ult. But no, she managed to walk out of the entire thing before it even appeared. That is just plain stupid.\n\nI don't like the Q change to be honest. But at least you can still play him with it. W is also worthless at this point. You have a Q and an R with no means of escape, protection, or engage. Guess that's all you need. He was already an incredibly unpopular champ, now he is unplayable also. \n\nFor the last week, winrate in Master+ for NA... 28%. With 0 games played in two regions. How the hell do you get played so little that you don't even appear on least popular character lists? Seriously. 0 games in a week. But yeah, removing a .25 delay off his already delayed stun will boost that up. Maybe that will nudge him into being played once in the EU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galactopus","date":"2015-03-10T13:11:08.450+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot should just put his stun back the way it was he has plenty of weaknesses. Riot has some list they think they should base their \"balance\" on without understanding what they're doing.

They didn't want him in the pro games, because he's not allowing skill-based counterplay, only strategic counterplay. And that's what they're trying to get rid of. They don't want strategy, they want skill display in flashy trades. \n\nThat is the main reason. The other one is really close : Players that play on reflexes alone, having great skill with their high-mobility champion, were being destroyed because they didn't think twice before going in. \n\nThat is the direction the game is taking : less strategy, more display of skill in flashy trades. Veigar just happened to be a strategic champion played recently in the LCS, and hence couldn't stay the way he was.","replies":[{"poster":"KoryCooper","date":"2015-03-10T23:26:42.438+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically Riot is just ditching the whole smart part of the game, going full Brawn and no Brain, man, he's really taking a liking into being a sport...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-10T04:02:26.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buffs on pbe are actually amazing.\n\nThey just need to adjust his E more, or his w.","replies":[{"poster":"Yiffed By Veigar","date":"2015-03-10T04:34:02.331+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, I will be tuned for the next PBE changes in the next cycle, I really hope they make Veigar viable again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reazale","date":"2015-03-10T14:32:51.293+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are not amazing , they arent fixing any of his problems, his weakness are still there, his counter play is still there and his ability to land W and E is still lacking.\n\nThis half assed rework has me on my nerves...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-03-10T03:00:21.791+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new change to the wall (dash stop as soon as the champ touch the wall), we can assume ally knockback do the same too.\n\nSo, if he really need some buff after the next patch (and is W will probably be the target), why not make the spell produce an \"area knock back\" (like ziggs W) when cast in Event horizon (ennemy trap will be forced to choose bewteen taking damage and not being displace much or take no damage but being trow in the stun)","replies":[{"poster":"Yiffed By Veigar","date":"2015-03-10T03:02:29.006+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, that actually sounds pretty good +1 ^^\n\nBut the problem to catch them in the middle still remains, but we well see.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-03-10T01:08:25.948+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its likely that W's delay might be lowered","replies":[{"poster":"Yiffed By Veigar","date":"2015-03-10T01:13:57.257+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yeah, I totally agree with you, I was just suggesting the slow and blind changes for the E's stun, because I usually play as a support Veigar and that shit totally works for me!","replies":[]}]}]}
