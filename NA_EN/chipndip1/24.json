The game with the Camille backdoor had I think 12 kills called in a 30 something minute long game.\n\nThe reason games are faster in lower elos is because no one cares and always takes the risky play instead of the safe one. Pretty much every death is avoidable whether it be from proper set up before hand (vision or lack thereof) or during (flashing the blitz hook itself instead of taking it and then flashing after you lose 80% of your health so you still die). I'm not perfect in the slightest. Far from it. But I RARELY reach record high death counts that some players consistently get because they don't pay attention to anything and just want to \"make the big plays and 1v9\" even though that is never going to happen against people actually playing league of legends to win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2018-10-15T04:50:20.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Balterein,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vOf5LelG,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-10-14T22:17:07.896+0000)\n>\n> The community as a whole has to get together at some point and say this is how the game should be balanced: Either Pro Play or Casual.

It'd be balancing around the top 0.4 percentile.\n\nEven D5 would be more reasonable as it's the top 2.15%.

You balance mainly around there because almost everything that works in high elo works in low elo too, and if there's some egregious balance anomaly in low elo, such as Yorick you nerf that. It's what Riot was doing ages ago and works extremely well.\n\nThe issue is Riot really doesn't give much of a shit about high elo solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2018-10-15T05:56:16.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, I look to it as \"It can fix itself\", which is clearly not the case.
