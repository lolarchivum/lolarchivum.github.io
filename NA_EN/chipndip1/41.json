It&#039;s like people don&#039;t even know what game they&#039;re playing these days. Or rather, they know what the game is and they&#039;d rather be playing &quot;League of *insert summoner name here*&quot; instead.\n\n**League is part dynamic gameplay, yes, but it&#039;s PART STRATEGIC.** No one seems to give two flips about the latter half of the game, though. Yes, that means team comps *always* matter. Yes, that means if you pick the only tank in your comp and go full ad, you&#039;re a moron. No, the game shouldn&#039;t have to be bent and twisted to compensate for your pre-game or in-game stupidity in this regard. If you have an abundance of split pushers, no one&#039;s gonna hold objectives for you to split. If you have an abundance of utility champs, you put extreme emphasis on your few damage dealers. If you have a crap ton of assassins, know that you don&#039;t have utility and you invested a shit ton into the early game. If you intentionally disregard certain elements of the game, you can&#039;t just up and complain about it when you get rolled by those elements in the game. The issue is that people act like this game&#039;s balanced like a fighting game. That&#039;s *part* of it, yeah, but not all of it. You&#039;re gonna have bad match-ups, you&#039;re gonna have to worry about who&#039;s who and who&#039;s doing what, and no, you can&#039;t do everything yourself, nor is it a smart idea to balance a team game so that you consistently can.\n\n**How many times are we gonna whine about meta/champs?** And I don&#039;t mean the *usual* whining. I mean the whining that caused the assassin update. THAT whining. If it isn&#039;t a tank meta, everyone wants it to be a tank meta. If it IS a tank meta, everyone complains about fighters being bad. When assassins are one-shotting targets, everyone wants Riot to add counter-play to &quot;no counter-play, face-roll assassins&quot;. When they add that to those champs, now we&#039;re bitching about adcs not being killed. When Riot&#039;s doing champ updates in bulk, everyone complains about how they hate class updates. When class updates are officially dropped, people start talking about wanting that &quot;Diver update&quot; that was in the pipeline. \n\nNow, we could go on with this for a LONG time, but the point is: Regardless of if these things were good or bad things to complain about, are you guys upset because they&#039;re *actually issues* or because *you just don&#039;t like X and you want something to happen?* Perfect example being game length. In season 5, no...not every champ was good. Every LATE GAME CHAMP was good. Early game bullies had it rough as hell in season 5 during Cinderhulk&#039;s early months and team comps could have up to 3 tanks at a time, with comps *regularly* having at least 2 tanks. Games would go on for 40+ minutes almost consistently, and Jinx/Vayne were CONSTANTLY complained about, which led Riot to eventually nerf the absolute crap out of Jinx (to the point where she&#039;s kinda shit, tbh). And now we got *thread after thread* begging Riot to force game lengths to be *longer* than now. Why? Makes no sense. We have a solid mix of early and late game champs being strong picks *right now.* Why would we fuck that over? It makes even LESS sense when people *also* want hyper carries like Twitch to be nerfed *at the same time.* HELLO? These two complaints don&#039;t even add up together.\n\n**The circle jerk is probably the worst offender.** The Yasuo and Fiora jerks are probably the worst of them all, but seriously, these circle jerks are just too damn much. Like...let&#039;s take Twitch&#039;s circle jerk, for example. If I go to LeagueofGraphs, Twitch has about a 51.6% win rate atm (for Diamond, anyway). Now, a Rioter specifically commented on Twitch (forget which) and said &quot;Rain or shine, Twitch usually sits on about a &#039;pretty solid&#039; win rate because his kit allows him to exploit elements that thrive in solo queue more than organized play&quot;. Makes sense if you think on it. When Censer was strong, Twitch had about a 52% win rate. Censer&#039;s not strong? Still around 52%. Some champs just abuse solo queue, and Twitch most likely is that type of guy. Hell, the highest win rate solo queue marksman isn&#039;t even Twitch according to this site. It&#039;s *fucking Draven* at almost 55% after the Censer nerfs brought down all the hyper carries. So why the hell is everyone and their G-ma on Twitch for basically existing in stasis? Should Twitch just get Sejuani&#039;d? Is that how balancing should be? Champs should just &quot;take turns being good&quot;? Is that the answer we&#039;re looking for?\n\nMy issue isn't necessarily having a complaint. That's fine. My issue stems from complaints that look like people just want Riot to fix the game to cater to them specifically rather than looking at why something may be the way it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-11-06T03:25:20.320+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":4,"body":"Your entire post is based on the idea of the League of Legends community being one hive mind.\n\nIt isn't, that's why there's always going to be conflict of interests and complaining. \n\nIt's not that they don't see why something exists.

I dont think \"Man, leblanc is bs\" when im killed. The problem is, assassins are actually hard to play now. They are all skill expressive in their kits rather then waiting for key abilities to be used. You want tank ekko and fizz back? Those where only killed because riot succeeded in adding delay to them. They added a delay to ekko passive and fizz's mark, and that succeeded in removing the \"toxic\" playstyles.\n\nI will NEVER miss being oneshot from stealth by rengar. NEVER.\n\nReworking assassins was the BEST thing riot ever did. Katarina is so much more fun then she used to be, and highly rewards skill with her kit. She has actual skill expression now, instead of just waiting. Leblanc is still as good as ever, while remaining fair. Sure you can flash her damage as shes waiting for the delay, but thats what makes her fair. If she gets the sigil proc off, it HURTS. Talon now fills a niche and feels GOOD to play, and is much more memorable then the guy that popped into vision for 2 seconds before oneshotting your entire team. Rengar... ill admit he got the short end of the stick, but change the Q and hes back to being a good and satisfying champion.

Removed items that had strange mixes of stats, while keeping some overtuned ones that keep bending balance; crippling flexibility in build paths and enforcing stale repetition. The previous time masteries was massively changed, it caused a make/break because a couple keystones were so much more powerful than others, limiting useful options and here we are putting up with it once again. Blatantly ignoring the pbe feedback when it doesn't entirely approve of their changes, frequently holding favoritism for some champions over others to an obnoxious degree; more recently lowering the standard of entry, allowing a flood of meta-maniacs and otherwise egotistical players to join, making the pbe environment hostile and troublesome to use now. Gutting some champions for being too good at a niche, while letting the generalists continue to bully out anyone who can't keep up. There's been a growing cluster of complaints about how towers are more valuable to the enemy than yourself, for the past three years, yet have been ignored time and again with marginal game-play nudges to say 'we are doing something about it'. Withholding the huge variety of gameplay modes under the excuse of 'not enough resources', then wondering why the game is loosing traction, and instead of undoing or reworking some of the previous changes that lead to this issue, they implement randomized rewards both in and out of game. Esports taking precedence over everything else, including common sense when it comes to quality of life regarding the overwhelming majority of the player base. Crunching the game that used to be about strategy, where early game and late game teams were both equally viable, into a state where early game decides everything; shifting the tense 45 minute neck & neck struggles, into 15 minute stomps. \nI could expand on any one of these, but I won't in this message as that'd triple the text, lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-11-06T19:11:10.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It's basically like politics.\n\nThis hits the nail on the head. _That's_ why it feels so shitty to spectate these arguments.

Everybody prefers different types of champions because they fit most to his/ her playstyle.\n\nSo, yes, people complain about \"meta\" when the meta forces THEM to do something they don't want... and, they should have that right, because the game should be balanced enough so that all strategies make sense at all times (or, rather - and I agree with you here - that picking the right strategy counters the wrong strategy of the opposing team)... a constant struggle for Riot's balancing team that they will simply not be able to solve.\n\nYou know why? Because they balance based on data over a large sample size of games, and that large sample size ALREADY FOLLOWS the expected meta on average... the mere assumption that a champion should have a 50% win rate on average is leading to an UNBALANCED game, UNLESS that game also follows \"the meta\" (that was the basis for the 50% win rate) to the letter... so, \"picking the right strategy\" is not an option that you should ever think about, \"picking the right champion within the current meta\" is the only choice you need to make. Because that is the WAY the game is balanced in the first place (yes, you may be so great at the game that you can ignore the meta if you play at a level that is significantly below your actual skill, sure... but that doesn't change the fact for the average player).\n\nAnd obviously, a lot of these problems are further made worse by what players think and assume: nobody knows whether maybe Soraka jungle is exceptional SOMETIMES (ok I am exaggerating...;)), nobody knows whether maybe playing with 2 junglers is a good idea SOMETIMES, nobody knows whether having 2 people mid instead of bot is a good idea SOMETIMES... because if you TRY EVEN ONCE, you tilt your team because they expect everybody to follow a very narrowly defined meta at all times.\n \nTake the example of the Singed Support player with Smite... he EVEN GOT BANNED BY RIOT because he interfered too much with the expectations of other players on his team, ALTHOUGH he explained his strategy AND he had a positive win rate with it...\n\nSo, my suggestion is this: stop pretending I am allowed to play all champs, that LOL is some sort of strategy game, that team work is required, all those \"would be nice if it were true\" assumptions. Just let me pick a role, then offer me only the top champs that are \"meta right now\" and discard all the others... problem solved (the first step to that was forcing players to select a role... making more or less any not standard setup \"unacceptable\"... and then changing tower armor, to discourage the remaining \"strategic option\" of lane swaps). And then we can all finally focus on what LOL is really about: mechanical execution and very short time window tactical decision making... not \"strategy\" or team work.... you dreamers :)\n\nBy the way, that is what pro players are doing all the time: they don't try new strategies, they focus on mechanical execution. Because THAT wins them games, not strategies (see most recent Worlds, if you don't believe that)... at least, they THINK that... (see GBM at Worlds, and consider they had mechanically \"equal\" players in their roster...).","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-11-06T17:53:41.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Fervor Leona isn't a new strategy, guys!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n2) You're mixing up \"Playing a champ\" with \"Playing the lanes in a different fashion\" in this post.\n\n3) As far as solo queue goes, there's a time and place for just about any champ you can think of. However, the *strategy* part of that comes from knowing when to do so. If I'm about to throw out Charizard in a Water-type gym, Pokemon doesn't magically lose its strategic elements because I can't get away with that. It means I either had a stroke and mis-clicked or I was a moron the whole time. You can play something like Shaco or Teemo and win a game in solo queue, or even climb ranked. OBVIOUSLY this becomes harder in a game where you have *both* a Teemo and a Shaco at the same time. It's up to you to have a small enough champ pool to master a few champs to climb with while having a diverse enough champ pool to cover different drafting scenarios, assuming you care about pre-game odds.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-11-07T19:13:28.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to point out, you use pokemon as an example of a strategy game.\n\nBut one thing that pokemon does, which league absolutely fails to do now and keeps making worse, is to allow different kinds of the same type. \nE.g. \nEvery type of pokemon has a pokemon of that type which can be utilized in a particular way, and even the same pokemon which are commonly used for one purpose, can have an off builds which also include many other purposes.\n___\nUsing your example of the Charizard in a water-type gym...\n\nIf I **choose** to build my Charizard like this\n\nCharizard @ Passho Berry  \nAbility: Solar Power  \nEVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  \nModest Nature  \nIVs: 0 Atk  \n- Tailwind  \n- Sunny Day  \n- Solar Beam  \n- Roost\n\nThen yes, i would absolutely swap him into a water-type gym.\n___\n\nThat's what pokemon, as a strategy game has, that league now lacks, the choice in how you want to to use the tools at your disposal.

A substantial number of the people complaining about the way the game is designed, aren't complaining that they aren't doing the things they want. It's that they're doing things that they don't want, to the things which they play. Mind you, there are always complaints about the current meta, because there is always a subset of players who will not like it.\n\nOverall, I'd rather they just stop trying to make the disparity between the optimal and suboptimal choices so massive, or outright removing them so, that you have literally no say in how you play the game. A common complaint is so called \"noob traps\", but i never heard someone actually falling into one. It's always people who consciously walk into them, because it provides a different gameplay experience. \n\nI'd rather them have never added assassins to the game, because the systems aren't designed to support them.\n\nI'd rather them not have allowed AD to creep into the design space of AP.\n\nI'd rather them not have reworked dragon to provide more flat value to the winning team than the losing team.\n\nI'd rather them not have turned all champions into mono-build, and increasingly mono-stat, champions.\n\nyes, these are my opinions.

Which seems fine, so long as you're still in that demographic that's being catered towards, but eventually,** YOU become the players and NOT the potential players. ** As the old players stop playing, and only the most recent set of formerly potential players are overwhelmingly left.\nThis is why riot needed to make another game years ago, or at least actually allow their community to divide between game types, instead of failing to support different game modes and them eventually becoming so decrepit that people abandon them. \nThe problem is that they only support draft 5v5 ranked. That's the only game mode which they ever design anything around and the only game mode which they put any effort into maintenance. \n\nBasically, I don't want them to design the game for me.
