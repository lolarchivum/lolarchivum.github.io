As someone who *really* doesn't like Vayne, Silver Bolts is the only thing I can respect about her kit in terms of being able to keep sustained damage against even the tankiest of tanks where other ADCs can fall flat. The problem is that she has not only that true damage, but high mobility, reliable self-peel and CC, and stealth directly tied to her high mobility.\n\nAssassins will almost always lose to a Vayne of equal skill level (and killing squishy ADCs is one of the few things assassins are supposed to excel at very heavily), because she can force them off and kill them unopposed, while taking virtually no damage herself. If they're about to get away within an inch of their life, Vayne has the movement speed buff and Tumble to chase them down.\n\nA lack of waveclear alone isn't enough to balance out having so much power not even related to her actual damage output that she can *counter-assassinate assassins*.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-11-03T11:33:40.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Vayne killing assasins isnt something new she does indeed have alot of tools for that in her kit. But one of the bigger problems is that she is allowed to use pretty much all of them on these assasins. \n\nVayne doesnt care if you are tanky or not she kills everything equally fast because of the high attackspeed and silverbolts. When you go in with your tank she will likely tumble out of the engage and shoot you away during which time she is guaranteed to kill your teams tank/engager before your gapcloser comes off cooldown for a second attempt. \n\nThe other situation is she kill you first whilst her frontline tanks for her, Then after she can still kill your frontline as fast as Vayne's is being killed.\n\nUnless you have an aggro tank like Olaf or Mundo, Olaf deals more dmg the lower he gets but also relies on his lifesteal/spellvamp to not immediately die once he gets low. Mundo does something similar, He doesnt need as much armor as a regular tank but instead keeps regenerating whilst doing good damage. Both sort of force you to focus them and rely on their sustain to help keep them alive. With built in tenacity and sustain they can get past your frontline and and stay alive long enough for your team, including you the assasin to help kill their backline faster. \n\nBut now that sustain is cut in half And vayne will deal a fat burst of damage every 3th attack, effectively never allowing these heal/aggro tanks to ever get below 20% hp or they wont be able to do their job, normally its ok for someone like mundo to get past frontline drop 50% start fighting the adc drop to 20% but stay alive due to healing.\nThis allows the assasin to kill their ap/ad carry or adc on his team to either kill their fronline first.\n\nIf you go in first as assasin you will likely die vs Vayne. But now if you go in as an aggro/healtank first you will also likely die. Normally you can build armor vs adc but this isnt very effective vs vayne due to true dmg but building hp doesnt work well either due to % true dmg, So aggro/heal tanking was always the best counterplay but now this too wont work properly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"laststanding6","date":"2015-11-02T09:55:58.390+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"@RitoRpertoir can you guys please start replying to the wave of threads expressing concerns with the marksmen changes?

The thing that a lot of the champions that they changed dramatically have in common is that they \"aren't in a good place\" at that time.  Old Sion was hardly played.  And for good reason, he had a wonky... scratch that, bizarre kit that was pretty broken.  There's a lot I could write on it but the point is there was call for it to be massively changed.  \n\nThere are champions who aren't played, whose kits are out of date, perform less than average,  have certain _Issues_ or whatnot.  These champions are somewhat \"ok\" to take risks on, not just because they are unpopular and thus don't have many people depending on their abilities being what they are, but because they need large changes to even make enough of a difference.\nOn the other hand, other champions are more popular because they are working at least well enough.  Despite whatever memes there are or whatever out there, these other champs are actually in a pretty good place right now and only need minor adjustments;  it makes sense to be cautious with these champions because a larger change could unexpectedly even more than what is predicted and throw them into awful territory\n\n---\nYou might want to check out those videos; Deya mentioned Stonewall and what he was actually saying in those videos had a point.  Some champions can be hard to change, even if there are issues with their gameplay.  Take Tryndamere's Undying Rage and Teemo's darts and shrooms.  Riot could try to address Trynd's ult being broken and holding back the rest of his kit or how Teemo just acts as an irremovable nuisance the entire game... but how?\n\nTryndamere's Undying Rage is central to his kit and character; if you take it out Tryndamere loses what makes him Tryndamere.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-11-02T14:31:55.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes Sion is a good example.
