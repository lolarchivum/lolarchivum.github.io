I pretty much ping for my whole team and when I'm not focusing too hard I'm telling them what to do as well and so far it has worked out perfectly, therefore I think I can allow myself and take onto the decision when we surrender or not.\n\nIf we are all behind and no one is ahead that's a clear loss.
