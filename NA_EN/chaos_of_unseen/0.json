If someone is acting up and they refuse to stop them just mute and report them instead of feeding the trolls so-to-speak. If that other player continues to act up then they will eventually be punished as well. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nAs far as cussing is concerned, cursing by itself usually won't get you punished. However, it's when you start cursing at others that it becomes a problem. From the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**What's the point of having a language filter if I can get banned for 'adult' language?**\nWe aren't out to punish players who use adult language; in fact, very few players are ever banned for saying stuff like \"f***, I missed that skill shot\" or \"damn, f***ing close game!\" However, the language filter is not an excuse to verbally abuse someone in the game. When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\n\n>**Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?**\nPlayers shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player.\n\nAlso, you're right in that this isn't preschool, so instead of whining and complaining that your poor behavior got you punished why not try to improve your own behavior instead? If you do then you might find that you enjoy the game more, plus there's also the occasional in-game rewards that you can get for good behavior every now and then as well. If you don't then you'll just keep getting punished and punished until you either shape up or ship out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Powderkegg","date":"2016-07-25T20:58:47.180+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your caps is stuck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-07-25T20:56:51.531+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop blaming your teammates.
