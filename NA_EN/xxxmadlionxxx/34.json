That's why I brought in the Armor example. Regardless if you build it or not, you will never have an instance where you'll be hit with true damage by conventional builds (aka not 6 Duskblades) due to the fact that you have a minimum of 75 Armor at Lv18, even on mages. \n\nThis is also a problem because Armor/MR to damage reduced of that type isn't linear. -15 MR from magic pen at 30-40 base MR will increase damage far more than 75 to 57 from a Lethality item (8% more iirc).\n\nMages are not burdened at all by building defensively. This is evident by Armguard beign able to built into Zhonyas, an item that can basically be built on any mage. Need MR as a mage? It goes into Banshee's, which gives the most amount of flat MR in the game (another form of bias when only mages can itemize MR).\n\n\"Well yeah, you shouldn't get damage and defensive stats so early and so powerfully that it took 3 items to counter 1.\" - Guess Armguard needs to be removed then if Hexdrinker is losing its MR, which is what Riot is planning. \n\n\"That is because he drinker plus the magic based shield rune plus hex drinkers shield made a very difficult issue for mages.\" - Oh, I'm sorry, you're struggling because I built specifically against you?

Anything else can be countered, but not mages. In the past 14 games, it's always been 2 mages mid, a mage support, or a mage top. It could very well be a maokai top pumping out AP damage, but oh wells, you still deserve to lose because you didn't play a specific character.\n\nCall me crazy, but isn't this the exact logic in Ardent Meta? Either you have one or you're instantly at a disadvantage.\n\n\"That is the point of counter building. There is a reason there are so many items.\" - That's why I'm so against more magic pen - There's literally nothing to build.

I want actual MR items that I can build that doesn't involve me just sitting on a null mantle all game because I have nothing to build into. This needs to happen before more magic pen items can actually exist. It's a problem when I have 2 full MR items that cost approximately 6K and I only have 150 MR.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2018-12-23T13:48:16.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Draconian565,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yEB4QpV4,comment-id=000500000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-23T04:22:28.209+0000)\n>\n> The fact that it&#x27;s basically mandatory to buy MR is already a problem. \n\nIt isnt.\n\nThat&#x27;s why I brought in the Armor example. Regardless if you build it or not, you will never have an instance where you&#x27;ll be hit with true damage by conventional builds (aka not 6 Duskblades) due to the fact that you have a minimum of 75 Armor at Lv18, even on mages. \n\nThat is because AD enhances both auto attacks and abilities rather than solely abilities as is the case with the majority if mages.\n\n\n> \n> This is also a problem because Armor/MR to damage reduced of that type isn&#x27;t linear. -15 MR from magic pen at 30-40 base MR will increase damage far more than 75 to 57 from a Lethality item (8% more iirc).\n\nIf it decreases linearly you would need to rebalance the game as a whole because tanks would be shredded horrifically. \n\n\n> \n> Mages are not burdened at all by building defensively. This is evident by Armguard beign able to built into Zhonyas, an item that can basically be built on any mage. \n\nThis is such a tiresome and poor argument and yet it continues to see mention 5 years later.\nA seeker rush is not something any mage wants to do period.\n\n\n>Need MR as a mage? It goes into Banshee&#x27;s, which gives the most amount of flat MR in the game (another form of bias when only mages can itemize MR).\n\nNeed mr as an ad assassin?\nGo maw.\nOr you can go mercurial scimitar and cleanse any cc on you including knockups.\n\nSee? I can name options as well and frame it to sound like a great 1st item rush in all situations!\n> \n> &quot;Well yeah, you shouldn&#x27;t get damage and defensive stats so early and so powerfully that it took 3 items to counter 1.&quot; - Guess Armguard needs to be removed then if Hexdrinker is losing its MR, which is what Riot is planning. \n\nWe already went over this in regards to armor vs mr purposes and why you get more of the former.\nA single 450 gold item requires a void staff minimum to defeat. No one rushes void staff because cdr, mana, and ap are so much more important after the removal of mana pots.\n\nYou can still pick up a 450 gold item to reduce magic damage severely. \n\n> \n> &quot;That is because he drinker plus the magic based shield rune plus hex drinkers shield made a very difficult issue for mages.&quot; - Oh, I&#x27;m sorry, you&#x27;re struggling because I built specifically against you? Who would have though.\n\nThe issue was how they stacked in conjunction with the shield creating a large amount of eHP which competed with a dedicated tanks damage reduction ability which any ad damage building champ could achieve with ease.\n\n> \n> &quot; - that&#x27;s default saying that you must have a mage at all times, which is the exact problem. \n\nWell yeah. You need mixed damage types so that you can effectively damage everyone at all times.\nJust as you want an rADC because of their effectiveness against towers and scaling capability.\nGod forbid you have variety for effectiveness. Clearly it's a problem when the main magic dealing damage class sees use because it's the main magic damage dealing class!\n\nThat's like being upset that having at least 1 tank is good for your comp due to their cc and initiation capability.\n\nCurses! I shouldn't have to counter build or counter pick!\n\n>Anything else can be countered, but not mages. In the past 14 games, it&#x27;s always been 2 mages mid, a mage support, or a mage top. It could very well be a maokai top pumping out AP damage, but oh wells, you still deserve to lose because you didn&#x27;t play a specific character.\n\n\nVery sure statistics and pr play do not support such a statement.\nViktor top is the only case of a kage competing up top and guess what? He counters urgent and aatrox, ad champs, who heat everyone else.\nI guess its convenient everyone forgot about the times of renekton too. \n\n> \n> Call me crazy, but isn&#x27;t this the exact logic in Ardent Meta? Either you have one or you&#x27;re instantly at a disadvantage.\n\nSame could be said about tanisha and adcs. \n\nNerf them. Plox.\nArdent 8s also not comparable.\n\n> \n> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so against more magic pen - There&#x27;s literally nothing to build. What can you actually build to counteract magic pen beyond just sitting on a null mantle? While mages pump out aoe damage in mid game teamfights, everyone else has to be stuck with building defensively?\n\nThere doesn't need to be more magic pen since it is unnecessary, but, you are truly blowing the issue of mages and their penetration values out of proportion.\n\nYou dont need anything but mull magic mantle because the mage is forced into counter building against it which sets them behind.\nMages are the most resource heavy class. Being forced into oblivion orb and sorc boots over a lost chapter item is painful. Counter build according to your champ.\n> \n> I&#x27;m not calling for a nerf of AP items like hashinshin, as I despise his notion that everything non-Jax should be nerfed.

This needs to happen before more magic pen items can actually exist. It&#x27;s a problem when I have 2 full MR items that cost approximately 6K and I only have 150 MR.\n\nThe difference is Mr blocks all magic damage which is nigh exclusively ability based.\nArmor seals with physical which 8s ability and auto based hence the higher values overall.\nAs much as everyone complains it's a damage meta, part of the issue is  none wants to build defensively.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-12-23T06:13:01.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean  that's probs because {{item:3916}} is part of a lot of mages core builds.\n\n{{item:3165}} and {{item:3135}} are used in 90% of mages builds, the same way {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} are for Assassins. \n\nThe only difference is mages are more stat based then Assassins.
