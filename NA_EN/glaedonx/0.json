Everyone is complaining about Zed, Lee Sin, and obviously Sona being way to OP (Kappa).\n\nZed. Why not make his second Ult activation a reset? This would mean Zed has to kill the target that he uses his Ult on in order to activate the shadow to escape. So if he goes balls deep into a Zhonyas, or Ults a tank to dodge a skill, he can't just get right back out. \nEdit: This wouldn't make his Ult cooldown reset, it would just allow him to step back to his Ult shadow.\n\nZed's problem seems to be that he has too much kill potential and mobility.

And maybe his ratios would need adjusting to support a change like this. Bottom line, in my opinion at least, is that he is too safe. He can jump into a fight with no consequence as long as the fight takes place away from his R shadow, he can jump out as he wishes. He needs some downside because as it stands, even if you manage to focus him, he can still kill someone on your team faster and get out.\n\nI never said that this type of change would work in a team fight scenario. It may be used better for cleanup or 1v1s. Zed may be used for Picks or traps. That is exactly the problem with current zed, any situation he is put in, he can perform up to par or better. That's not really fair. He needs a weakness and I can't think of a reasonable weakness that he has right now.\n\nIn another comment I said that if it were up to me, Zed and his allies would have something like 0-5 seconds from the Ult cast to kill the target that was Death Marked, If the target dies in that window, he can port back to his ult shadow, otherwise it's strictly used for copying his spells.\n\nThanks for the different point of view!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-01-07T16:07:09.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This wouldn't work.

I do see the reasoning to why they added in the escape. I mean I feel like he does need it to survive in fights. It's just entirely too easy to escape effectively in it's current state. People use it just to dodge skillshots and to juke people. I feel like it's just too versatile and safe as it sits.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LuckyReden","date":"2015-01-07T15:43:17.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So just trying to clarify here, so is it if he kills the target the shadow able to be returned to, or if the deathmark is confirmed to be deadly (if the damage from death mark will kill the target, not has killed the target) the shadow is returnable.  \n\nBecause if he has to wait for kill thats a bigger nerf than getting deathmark kill.  plus the deathmark kill forces him to hit all of his abilities meaning that a zhonyas or cc by team would save a teamate and trap him.","replies":[{"poster":"Glaedonx","date":"2015-01-07T16:08:06.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuckyReden,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EhEgJgUG,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-07T15:43:17.613+0000)\n>\n> So just trying to clarify here, so is it if he kills the target the shadow able to be returned to, or if the deathmark is confirmed to be deadly (if the damage from death mark will kill the target, not has killed the target) the shadow is returnable.  \n> \n> Because if he has to wait for kill thats a bigger nerf than getting deathmark kill.  plus the deathmark kill forces him to hit all of his abilities meaning that a zhonyas or cc by team would save a teamate and trap him.\n\nWhat I was thinking was, the target that Zed Ults has to die. This death can be prior to Death Mark proccing, it can be caused by Death Mark proccing, or it can be a teammate killing the target death mark is on. I supposed it could even be shortly after Death Mark falls off. I figure give zed somewhere between 0-5 seconds to kill the target he Ults. If the target dies in that window, he has the option to jump back to his Ult shadow for somewhere around 3-4 seconds. It's a tradeoff because, as you stated, he can be CC'd/Zhonyas/QSSd, but that's the point. Counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"LuckyReden","date":"2015-01-07T16:11:57.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So currently theres a skull or something that shows up if Zed's deathmark will kill the target, what are your thoughts on that also being what activates his shadow?","replies":[{"poster":"Glaedonx","date":"2015-01-07T17:16:06.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuckyReden,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EhEgJgUG,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-01-07T16:11:57.043+0000)\n>\n> So currently theres a skull or something that shows up if Zed's deathmark will kill the target, what are your thoughts on that also being what activates his shadow?\n\nI'm not opposed to that. \n\nThe thing is that even if there is enough damage to kill the target before it procs, the target hasn't necessarily been killed yet, so it wasn't necessarily my original vision. This basically means that the target could still Zhonya or QSS or be Mikaels'd before they die. \n\nI still like that idea though, it takes a bit off of how big of a nerf it is.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gank in Progress","date":"2015-01-07T16:43:08.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"great idea. i dont care what theyre doing, as long as they do something. but since riots balance team is full of gold players seeing sona as a higher threat than zed we can wait for a solution for many more months. **** it","replies":[{"poster":"Glaedonx","date":"2015-01-07T17:07:22.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quality PIayer,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EhEgJgUG,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-01-07T16:43:08.908+0000)\n>\n> great idea. i dont care what theyre doing, as long as they do something. but since riots balance team is full of gold players seeing sona as a higher threat than zed we can wait for a solution for many more months. **** it\n\nThanks.\n\nI don't think Riot is necessarily putting Zed a lower priority than Sona.
