Prior to 1868 the Bill of Rights only limited the power of the federal government and could only be enforced upon the federal government. \n\nThere are currently eight states that still require a religious test to hold public office or give preference to candidates who are Christian. Pennsylvania, for example, requires belief in a supreme being and heaven/hell afterlife to run for office. Obviously, that is illegal now because of the incorporation of the 1st Amendment by the 14th Amendment.\n\nThis ends today's legal lesson. =)","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-18T23:57:00.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was attempting to not turn it into a legal lesson, but you are correct that the 14th amendment does have a grey area - but it *still* only applies to governments. There is a reason nobody brings cases on it - because they don't know how they will turn out at all (and they won't get paid if it doesn't end favorably :P).\n\nI am not a lawyer, but personally, my reading of cases suggests that the P/I clause applying the \"freedom of speech\" requirement to state governments is iffy at best. The first amendment was explicitly written to say \"Congress shall make no law\" - it does not say \"There shall not be any law\" - it specifically says \"Congress\". This is in contrary to other amendments/clauses such as the 2nd which explicitly apply to *everything* - in saying \"the right... shall not be infringed\" - vs - \"Congress shall make no law\". As Congress in the US Constitution is generally understood to apply specifically and exclusively to the US Congress, it is uncertain whether the 1st amendment can be enforced on states through the 14th, unlike the 2nd which was shown to be so by the P/I clause given that the 2nd says \"the right... shall not be infringed\" and thus it is a right given - not a prohibition on Congress. Further suggesting that 1A may not apply is the 10th amendment - which states \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution... are reserved to the States respectively\" - which never makes any mention of something prohibited to Congress being prohibited to the states. In fact, we see this with other parts of the constitution where Congress is prohibited from doing something explicitly *so* states are able to regulate it.\n\nAll in all, this is a **very** unresolved issue that is basically moot as afaik all 50 states guarantee freedom of speech from their government in some way shape or form. That being said, upon some further investigation, I've realized just how extremely controversial this is and that some lawyers believe it's settled under Due Process clause of the 14th amendment. Makes me want to become a lawyer in fact :P\n\nNice to read someone doing their research and if you'd like to continue this discussion or throw more case studies at me please add me in game - I love learning legal issues just because I'm a very semantical person :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Exillic","date":"2018-01-18T23:26:12.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chermorg,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tR8zgnrG,comment-id=000100000001000000010000000000000001000100000000,timestamp=2018-01-18T23:23:54.412+0000)\n>\n> Freedom of Speech does not apply to private corporations in the US.
