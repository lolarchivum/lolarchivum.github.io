Notice I said MATCHMAKING not ELO or MMR.\n\nHere's the deal.  It's a good system when your matchmaking value goes up faster than your visible rank or elo.  Example: It's OK for a Gold 5 player to go on a 10 game win streak to get into G4 and then all of the sudden start running into G1 and Platinum 5 players.  You will either start getting smacked and things will level out, or you will rightfully keep winning and just get where you belong faster.  This part RIOT does correctly.\n\nHere's what doesn't work, putting players on a losing streak on the team with someone on a win streak.  Now I understand the idea here.  You want to make sure the winning player isn't just by luck getting carried repeatedly and that the losing players aren't just having bad luck and getting sandbagged by trolls repeatedly.  I get that.  I really do.  But the game is not balanced for that.  \n\nWhen you put a player on an upswing on a team with 3 players who are either significantly lower elo and/or on a losing streak, you are essentially saying that if you are so good you should be able to carry 3-4 other tilted players.  RIOT themselves has said they don't want League to be a game where a person can reliably solo carry.  So you create a system where a person has to do something you don't want them to be able to do in order to win?  It's directly contradictory.  Champions and roles are not designed/balanced to solo carry, so do not implement a mechanic that creates and artificial environment that most likely (by design) results in a loss.\n\nMy only explanation for this is the almighty $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.  If I had to guess I'd say this mechanic exists so that if a historically silver player gets a stroke of luck and goes on a win streak he finds himself in Gold territory and decides to stop playing so that he can maintain the end season rewards.  Or conversely, that if a traditionally higher elo player randomly gets sandbagged he doesn't decide to stop playing because he's had to play 20 games in  top gold when he's never had an issue making it to Platinum in the past.\n\nHuman interference ruing a system that would be so much better when random.  Let win streaks boost hidden MMR and to some degree actual visible ELO, but do not let them become a factor in matching based on win lose streaks.  Just let matchmaking be fully based on MMR/ELO.  If we lose a player just because they found themselves a little higher or lower, they were gonna quit soon anyway the minute their favorite champ or style of play got nerfed.\n\nHere are my questions to RIOT:\n\nDo the above situations really happen often enough that you are OK irritating the crap out of people trying to hard climb? (I'm guessing the number of people trying to climb and getting snubbed by this mechanic is much much higher than the number of people who might actually quit or reduce their game volume in a significant way).\n\nDo you actually think that going on a losing streak because of just random bad luck is more annoying than a system in your favorite game actively trying to stop your win streak despite it being contradictory to the game's philosophy?\n\nP.S. If you actually take my advice and you find a player who has been silver or lower for 3 seasons or more on their main account suddenly get carried by luck into Diamond, I will retract all previous statements, acknowledge that RIOTers are amazing God-Prophets and will purchase a skin for every champion in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-01-06T05:49:30.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Whisper87,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ekpTAEH,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-01-05T22:50:05.895+0000)\n>\n> I totally agree that win and loss streaks should not be taken into account for matchmaking.

The difference was instead of starting ranked right away I treated it like a test, watching, reading, and trying out in custom games everything I could before I finally dove into ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2018-01-06T13:16:10.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah, go ahead and try to dodge the point:\n\nSince season 6 in which you reached P5 you have not managed to hold a winrate that is above 50%. In fact you had a 46% winrate with your main in S7 and a 44% winrate with your main so far in this pre-season. That means that it is just a fact that you have not improved in a long time. \n\nThus it's absolutely hilarious that you claim that improving is being actively punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-01-06T18:46:55.732+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, lets look at QT's account chowdog on op.gg\n\nWhile yes he does a gimmick sometimes, you honestly think possibly the best player on NA....naturally holds a 52% winrate.\n\nNo if QT had his way and didn't do his gimmicks he could easily hold a 75% winrate.\n\nBut no, look at his history. 4 wins 4 losses 2 wins 2 losses, its all a pattern which is totally unnatural. QT has proven he is consistent in play to a point where he shouldn't be 'going on tilt'. He already achieved rank 1 challenger earlier last year, so if you honestly think that QT's winrate is naturally 52% then you are just as drunk out of your mind as riot wants you to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Seilleas","date":"2018-01-06T00:02:54.361+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It´s actually legit, I think that if the system sees that you solo carried your game total stomp by yourself, the next game you get team so shit you cant possibly carry 1v5,  in very many cases even in higher elo I experience having 3 bad players one alright one and me vs 5 good players and theres just no chance of winning anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captainn Ginyu","date":"2018-01-06T04:28:54.683+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel as if a lot of people are fanboying in here \"no the system isint rigged/broken! your just bad\" covenant everytime i get on a winstreak its halted as soon as i hit promo's by afk'ers trolls people who are tilted an so on an i end up on a losing streak cause i get slapped with a lot of these people till i eventually get shoved back on a winstreak again\n\nan no you cant solo carry this game unless the team your fighting against is totally brain dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2018-01-06T00:55:49.414+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"got matched up with 2 unranked players that obv belonged in bronze 2 at most.
