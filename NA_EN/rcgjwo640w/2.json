This is one I&#039;m actually kind of skeptical about since we already have Maokai and I think if they went the tanky/support route with him, he&#039;d just feel too similar.\n\nWhat do you guys think he can do?

We made sure to regularly check that we were delivering fairly different gameplay, visual appearance and personality despite the thematic overlap as a result.

I personally feel like he is going to be to much like Maokai, and I mean, do we really need another tank champion? Especially when it's already the tank meta? Shouldn't Riot be trying to break the meta to help push the gameplay forward and make it even more intense? \n\nAnyways, when it comes to his abilities I feel like one of them will be for him to be able to grow a bush anywhere he wants that slows enemies that walk through it and stealths allies. From his video it makes him look like some sort of protector of the forest, a little to similar to Maokai, but I can't help getting the feeling that his passive is that he heals or gets some sort of extra buff when he kills monsters. Another ability of his might be that he can turn jungle monsters into temporary minions of his. For his ult, it's definitely going to be some sort of AOE because basically almost all tanks have an AOE ult, again a little to much like Maokai. \n\nI also feel that Riot should really start rethinking about how much CC they give their tank champions. Yes, tanks should have _some_ CC but when you give them like 3 different knock-ups or slows they're basically a support champion. Tanks should be able to disrupt enemies but their main purpose is to soak up damage for their team. I mean giving them so much CC is the reason we have people who play Sion, who has 2 knock-ups, a stun, and a slow, as support. Not to mention Maokai who has 2 slows, a knock-back, and a root. \n\nI just hope the assassin update will finally change the meta.
