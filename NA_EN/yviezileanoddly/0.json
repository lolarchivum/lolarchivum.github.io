Multiplied by .55 for a shared lane is 24.2. Since he increases experience by 8% that means his lane reaches level 2 how much faster? Let&#039;s find out!\r\n\r\n(280 / 24.2) -(280 / (24.2 * 1.08) ) = .857! So that means you hit level 2 almost but not entirely 1 minion faster than your enemies! \r\n\r\nYou read that right, folks. And that&#039;s not even mentioning the fact that he literally doesn&#039;t have a passive at level 18. \r\n\r\nI feel like before we even touch on other problems about Zilean, or before Riot even thinks about doing anything balance related, somebody over there needs to step up and change this passive. Leaving his passive in this state is nothing but carelessness and laziness, and I&#039;m honestly disappointed in whoever did this rework. \r\n\r\nBut it&#039;s not too late to fix your mistake! All you have to do is change his passive to something meaningful. And here I am, creating a discussion just for you, Riot, to gather ideas. You don&#039;t need to thank me.\r\n\r\nSo, people of the League of Legend boards! Let us rise up and give ideas for a new passive to our good ol&#039; chronokeeper!\r\n\r\nAn idea on reddit that I thought was really good was a mana regen aura.  This would especially be helpful to Zilean support, and imagine what it could do for adcs like Ezreal or Varus!\r\nAnd if you don&#039;t want to change the passive altogether, you can always just increase the experience gain to something meaningful. I think a 15% gain is a reasonable amount, considering the fact that he still wouldn&#039;t have a passive at level 18.\r\n\r\nPlease upvote and comment to get Riots attention!

Giving at least +1.4 health regen every 5 seconds. But in late game, him having a good 400 AP will allow up to +7.8 health regen every 5 seconds. It can even go up to 800 in late or even 1000 to allow +19.6 to +23.6 health regen every 5 seconds (or +3.92 to +4.72 health regen every second) when Zilean is nearby and this will also apply to himself. But, his own health regen may need a nerf to allow this. \n\nHealth regen right now is 5.44 (+0.5 per level). It can be changed to 5.12 (+0.2 per level).

If Zilean were to have 4/6/8/10/12% exp bonus, I think it might be unfair with his new passive... But, if it is allowed, at 12%, you gain a 1.39 faster, which is better than 0.857.

If W were his passive and that every little while he could double cast his non-ultimate level abilities then they could solidify either his mage or support play pattern and end this \"is he a support or is he a mage\" question. I am unsure as to what to add in place of W but I can imagine there are many options out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-06-24T20:26:31.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive: Sands of Time: When Zilean debuffs an enemy, they take (X + Y*(Zileans Level) + Z*(AP)) Magic Damage per Second for the duration of the debuff.
