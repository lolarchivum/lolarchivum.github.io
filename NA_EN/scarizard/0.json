No concrete promises on this, but we are exploring some options to make the Summoner Spell system more interesting.  Really have no idea when we'll be ready to deliver on this, but yes, Summoner Spells are on our collective radars as something that could clearly be improved upon.\n\n2. I mostly just disagree with this statement.  Morellonomnomnomicon and Athene's are both reasonably powerful in my estimation and we still usually see mages rush one of these two.  I do think there's a small gap here in terms of AP/CDR itemization for non-mana mages, but I also think this is a very niche market that we're hesitant to provide easy CDR for due to how overbearing a, let's say, Vlad can be when he can easily rush both AP and CDR in lane.\n\n3. Literally tons.  A lot of our early iterations on Rengar's Q in the rework come to mind, where we did stuff like using ferocity on Q would give you 3 stacks to make it the sustain damage option on him, but really basically just made him murder you even faster.\n\n4. Different reasons on all of these.  Kassadin's the most straightforward, where it's just about how his mobility profile gives him perfect control over when fights are happening, so the second he crosses a certain power threshold, he just consistently runs away with games.  Ryze is currently mostly about the mechanical needs of the character and just how much power a player gains from properly executing his passive combos, which means that he looks very weak for our average player, but is secretly one of the highest winrate characters for experienced players.  I could probably write a book on why Azir is a balance nightmare at this point, but in the interest of being able to respond to more posts today, I'll just say that it's very difficult to balance a hypercarry who has reliable means of ensuring their own safety and that Azir pushes the limits of both being a hypercarry and reliably ensuring his own safety.\n\n5. I've idly thought about what this would look like, but I don' think there's any chance of this actually happening.\n\n6. Very closely.  We try our best to give them good counsel on how to balance their characters pre-release and they try to give us advice on how to balance their characters while retaining their intended identities.\n\n7. There's a chance, but I think we're really hesitant about taking this route, as it does really limit players ability to pick the character they want to play in any given game.  I know there are some folks looking at pick/ban structure and I wouldn't be surprised if over the next few years the pick/ban system changed significantly, but it's not something we're directly looking at in the short term.\n\n8. 5.22, HYPE!\n\n9. Not in the short term.  There will be some crit shifting around in the pre-season, but we're not going to do anything so drastic as fully removing it in the near future.  I think long term, trying to shift random crits to conditional crits (like, say, every 3rd attack crits, or all your attacks from brushes crit, etc), might have some promise, but we've never really gotten a good enough model of this working to ship.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterVidallis","date":"2015-10-23T19:52:08.916+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any plans to make upgrading the warding trinkets less awkward?

If you're forced to back at lv 10 but can either upgrade it or finish a key item, that's not a fun strategic choice.

Her disengage power in Q/R is a reliable way to counteract the current menace of classic juggernaut types. She doesn't seem to be in need of any boosts at the moment, but that doesn't mean we aren't thinking of her. We'll need to re-evaluate a lot of champs, including her, when pre-season lands. :)\n\n{{champion:203}} is experiencing what nearly every new champion does. Extremely high ban rate in games, steep initial mastery curve...everyone is still trying to figure them out. They've proven to be powerful (not egregiously so, mind you) in the hands of experienced players (amount of games played). We tend to follow-up within a couple patches on new champions, and we will likely do something to adjust Kindred's power soon. Again, pre-season will be touching many characters and systems, so we don't want to be hasty in assessing a new champion's current balance!\n\nRegarding the ADC rework: since it won't be much longer, all I can say here is \"wait and see\".

Love 'em.\nNow then, Let's address the Elaphant in the Room; Mordekaiser.\n\nYes, we Mordekaiser fans have been pestering since day one to make his Slo lane viable again and Meddler even mentioned trading his duo lane power for enhanced base stats. Hooray!\n\nHis base stats are in fact abysmal; 1750 base health 20 base armor, 325 MS. It gets worse if you compare him to Darius with 2300 base health, more MS and 30 base armor.\nSo here's an avenue where to buff him for Solo since he should be scaling really well into the late game. AKA give him more health/level and maybe even nerf his base health to compensate.\n\nHis Iron Man passive feels rather lackluster if compare to pre-rework and I'd like to know your stance on it. Due to the loss of 10% shielding ratio and nerfing his AoE damage it's rather difficult to maintain a strong shield and actually make it FEEL impactful.\nAny thoughts on buffing its champion conversion rate to pre-rework levels around 30-35 % BUT cap his minion rate at 10 %  (For reference; his current shield gain from minions is 12.5% and pre rework it was 17.5%)\nIt would entice him to actually brawl more and make his bully nature somewhat more bearable. It's a fair trade off that would make him healthier, allow his passive to feel like the real Iron Man again and still make it balanced.\n\nAnd lastly the worst offender; HIs W being restricted to duo use.\nCan we just get it back? Please? Heavy Metal please with cherry on top?\nOn a serious not though, it is where most of his frustration and problems in solo lanes comes from. Might be worth looking at.\n\n\nAnyways, I'll be happy for ANY information regarding the Master of Metal...Erm...I mean IRON REVENANT :D\n\n~M.M","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2015-10-23T23:10:57.234+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Power-wise we feel Mordekaiser's too strong currently in the duo lane and too weak in the solo lane case. We're generally okay if duo is his main role, but the disparity between those roles is currently too high. His solo lane is too weak and his duo lane is too strong.  \n\nMordekaiser W is totally worth revisiting in regards to the solo vs duo cast, it can feel pretty lackluster and is a good spot to target to help bridge the gap between the Solo lane/ Duo Lane case. Not sure on specific changes we'd make, but we'll be looking into Morde specifically more after the first big preseason patch (PBE Soon(tm)!)\n\nI'm unsure specifically on % of shield conversion values. He's pretty damn durable atm, and I feel the minimum shield threshhold helped him a lot more in lane than is getting generally credited, but adjusting the W sustain could grant us the option of increasing his shield growth since that skill in particular is currently double dipping in generating shield and restoring health.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"droodftw","date":"2015-10-23T19:51:05.596+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the Q&A! My questions are a little more about a career in game balance.\n\n1) Did you know that balance was what you wanted to work in when training to work in the industry? If not, what brought you to balance?\n\n2) What's an average day like with you guys? Do you get reports/feedback from somewhere and asked on how you would want to balance it? I would imagine you do a lot of testing, but what else?\n\n3) How do you feel about the current meta? How would you define the term \"balance\" in terms of League of Legends? (i.e. For me, I'd say having as many champions be competitively viable in high-level/professional play as possible.)\n\n4) I myself am recently graduated from college in Comp Sci/Game Design and balance is a topic I'm very interested in working in. Any tips for how to be (for lack of a better word) more attractive for being hired as a balance specialist? For example, what could one do with their resume/portfolio that makes a balance team say \"We really should bring this guy on!\"?","replies":[{"poster":"SmashGizmo","date":"2015-10-23T21:11:09.821+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can only answer these personally, might be interesting to get other people's perspectives.\n\n1. 100% yes for me.  I came from a background of clinging onto competitive games for the long haul (been playing MtG for almost 20 years now, Smash Melee for 10, League for 6), so balancing and preserving the fairness of a game was always something super important and interesting to me.\n2. We work in 2 week sprints on each patch.  Once during each sprint we plan out our work on what we want to ship in the upcoming patch, which is a combination of the things we see as off as players and the outliers in terms of metrics like pick rate/ban rate/win rate.   Once we take on projects, we rapidly iterate and test changes until we get to changelists we're happy with.  We're also constantly re-evaluating our work so that if something super broken emerges we can hop on it ASAP (for instance, runeglaive Ezreal).\n3. This question is waaaaaaay too big to adequately answer.  I guess the tl;dr for me is that I'm happy we've hit the sort of diversity numbers in Professional play that we're seeing in Worlds this year, but that I still feel like some things are really off in terms of feeling like a fair and enjoyable experience for most players.  I won't dive too deep into this, but basically, Professional diversity is great and certainly one valid measure of how the game's balance is doing, but I don't think it captures the full picture by any stretch of the imagination.\n4. Make yourself visible as an expert on the game you're trying to work on.  This is pretty broad, but encompasses both getting to a relatively high rank and demonstrating your knowledge on the state of the game.  Stuff like blogging, writing articles, and streaming can all be good means of getting exposure and demonstrating that you get the game on a very deep level.  Also, perpetually seek the feedback of people who are already working on balance, as they can give great feedback about how you might be limiting your thoughts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fchyo","date":"2015-10-23T20:59:40.882+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello there, I'd just wanted to know if u guys have anything planned for Lissandra.\n\n{{champion:127}}  Lissandra - Since she was out you guys nerfed her damage howerver always putting more and more utility, but i guess she kinda needs to have her mana costs lowered; or i'd like to suggest an addiction to the passive ,along with the no mana cost spell, she could have like extra damage maybe scaling with level  only.

Is there any chance you are reviewing things like this to make the game more interesting? Here's some of the worst offenders IMO\n\n{{champion:74}}  His current passive (techmaturgical repair bots) has neither interaction or impact IMO. When his gameplay was reworked, the only interesting thing about it (the unique ability to heal towers) was stripped away, and that was really it. All we're left with is half an Aegis aura that also heals your turrets absurdly slowly. Is this really the best thing the inventor can come up with?\n\n{{champion:102}}  I know this is partially because of the clarity demanding you shift the wording, but this is really little more than a ball of stats (which I'm pretty sure you're not too fond of, right?) Again, can't we make it more interesting.\n\n {{champion:43}} {{champion:126}}  I'm pushing these two together because for me, they both suffer from the same problem. Their passive is literally an extension of one ability (both being their \"not\" ultimates). It feels like a band-aid fix to a problem you had in development of putting too much \"power\" onto their active abilities then compensating by effectively giving them no passive at all (even if this isn't true, that's the conclusion I've drawn). How is this right in a world when there are new champions with effectively two passives?\n\n{{champion:143}}  You've probably heard about this one a few times already, but I'll throw in my two cents. The problem here is that plant thematic cohesion aside, this passive just doesn't work. Apart from Karthus, all the other \"strike back after death\" abilities allow the player to chase down their killer or allies to some degree. Karthus still works due to his devastating E damage and uninterruptable Requiem making dying a viable option. None of this is true for Zyra. You get one restrictively narrow skillshot on an immobile mage who is trying to be as far away from the enemy as possible. It is way too easy to sidestep them attack with the time before you can make the shot. Not too mention her lore specifically highlights the new risk of dying. Why should anything in her kit require her to die if this is the case?\n\nThat's probably not an exhaustive list, but that's the ones I personally dislike the most. I doubt anything's going to change from this, but I'd like to at least know some of the designer's thoughts on these particular abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot GMang","date":"2015-10-23T21:28:27.121+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good question, and I agree that there are plenty of passives that leave something to be desired.\n\n**Regarding your examples:**\nSome of the champs you mentioned have also been singled out internally and gotten some experimentation (like Heimer, Shyv, and Syndra), though I can't speak to how they are prioritized among other projects in terms of urgency and which ones are planning to move forward (within our team specifically, the only one that springs to mind is Syndra, though no promises on exact ship date atm hah).\n\n**Regarding passive quantity:**\nThis is a controversial topic, but I wanna just share a bit of context here. It's important to keep in mind that we don't design passives in a vacuum and then decide how many each champion gets. Passives are designed to serve the needs of a particular champion.\n\nSay I'm a champion designer making a new kit, and I start with a particular gameplay loop that fits nicely on Q W and E slots. The kit is somewhat functional and unique, but there are still things to figure out (let's say the W and E have some usability issues, certain lane matchups are very one-sided, my abilities late-game are confusing team mates, my spell rotation feels too unreliable, wave clearing is too easy, and my build paths don't scale right). What I do with the Passive and R slots--indeed, what I do with **all **slots--are going to be about problems like these or addressing other higher levels goals (like delivering the fantasy better or more unique or something).\n\nThe answer to those problems might involve any number of changes, possibly demanding 0, 1, or 2+ passives. If I do add 2+ passives, it's **not **because I just want the champ to be cooler or have more stuff than others. And it **is** going to come at the cost of power budget and complexity budget, not just added on top of an otherwise finished, balanced champion. A solution might even involve removing/nerfing passives so that we have more complexity and power budget to put on actives!\n\nIn the end, individual slots are not supposed to be balanced between each other, nor are \"my champ passive(s)\" vs \"your champ passive(s).\" **Entire kits are supposed to be balanced between each other.** \"2 passives > 1 passive\" doesn't always follow. It's very possible to design a kit with high agency, complexity, and fun with just actives, and it's also very possible to design a super lame kit that has several passives! And it's those kinds of properties (agency, fun, complexity, clarity, etc.) that we care most about: if a champion's multiple passives leaves them with too much control over the game, or too much complexity, or something like that, **that** is a big concern for us (and we definitely aren't perfect about these things!). But the actual quantity is usually not inherently good or bad.\n\n**Regarding passive quality:**\nLemme give a different example: say we have a high-complexity champion who has everything BUT the passive slot locked down (you might have even had an awesome passive during development but it ended up being extraneous as other slots developed further). As in, \"if our game hadn't already set the precedent, I might actually give this champ 0 passives.\" This can be a tricky spot: players expect each of their slots to feel fun and distinct, including the passive slot, but you don't want to disrupt the balance and fun of your existing pattern/slots.\n\nA lot of these passives end up being lower-budget passives: we could have made Jayce get multiple intricate passives, but he's already so complicated and multi-faceted that it would probably detract from the kit to do so. Sometimes you make the call, \"this champ is about these cool actives, and we should avoid detracting from that here.\"\n\nThis isn't to say that \"lame passives\" are a good thing, but sometimes the cost-benefit of trying to discover a perfect passive is outweighed by the value of delivering the champion to players with a not-stellar passive. The opposite is also true: sometimes we have a champion that's bloated in complexity/abilities by the time we're reading to ship, but we're willing to make the trade-off for the sake of delivering what we feel is a good product to players.\n\n\nAll that said, improving lame slots is definitely on our radar; I just wanted to give context. I hope that provides a little clarity for why passives compare/contrast in the way they do!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-10-23T20:00:28.524+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok,I don't have a lot of original questions.So I ask for some simple stuff.\n\n{{item:1054}} - On a scale of 1 to 10 what do you think of this item?1 being a \"must rework or delete\" & 10 being a \"must buy 6 of these on every champ\".\n\n{{champion:75}} - My favorite Dog in League.If he was made today,what would he be like?\n\nCrazy ideas - If you could come up with a crazy idea that would completely change league,for better or for worse,what would it be?These ideas could range from stupid ideas that only exist in your head to ideas that maybe be worth considering to.I'll provide an example,add an area past top lane with an epic monster.The idea here is to make top lane a more important part of the map rather than the \"island\" full of tanks & split-pushers.Plus it would help with the whole \"Party down Bot!\" TP meta.What are you crazy ideas?\n\n{{summoner:4}} - Is it possible for just one patch during preseason to remove Flash temporarily?Just to see how hard things shake up.","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2015-10-23T21:13:05.980+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1054}} 9/10 - Situational buy that does its job when it needs to. \n\n{{champion:75}} The Cane - If he were made today, I assume he'd be classified as a juggernaut and not have an infinite scaling mechanic.

The recent Elise changes have been really good in my opinion, with the ratio buff on spiderlings and the Cocoon change allowing her to max W second both being changes that favoured her being built with pretty decent amounts of AP. Her nerfs have been good too, removing quite a lot of the free damage she gets in her kit, which is something that's caused huge problems in the past.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is how intentional this has actually been - do you want Elise to be an AP fighter? As much as she's overtuned right now it feels easier to balance her as an offensive champion than as a tank (seeing as she's actually building damage to do damage now, and is only really viable as a tank when she can blow people up without building AP), and I think she's delivering on her gameplay fantasy right now better than she ever has. Even when tank Elise was undeniably the best build a lot of people still preferred maxing W and building some AP just because it was way more fun than going tank, even if it was bad. But I never really got the impression that you guys preferred AP Elise, particularly as you seem to have a preference for what we see in competitive play, and that means you'd like tank Elise more.\n\ntl;dr is there a particular direction you want to push Elise in? Am I right in thinking that the playerbase seems to find AP Elise more fun, and if so will you take that into account when you do her next balance changes? It's very self-involved of me but I've been having a blast with AP Elise recently (even though lots of losses over the last few days ;_;) and I really can't imagine getting the same satisfaction from \"tanky stun bot Elise\".","replies":[{"poster":"ricklessabandon","date":"2015-10-23T21:03:49.057+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi, hi~\n\na lot of what you've been picking up on has been intentional—elise should have a path open to her that allows for gold to be spent on increasing her kill potential, and for less of that threat to be available 'for free' in the form of base stats/damages. since elise is a six-ability form swapper it's more important for her overall fairness to ask elise players to use their early-game power spike to earn a gold advantage and then invest it wisely in order to keep that strength going later into the game. i personally think it helps her feel more like a mage/assassin pairing (which seems more aligned with who she wants to be), whereas the elise of old felt more like a support/tank pairing.\n\nif i had to guess as to what areas we'd look at next, it would be ones that would let us stay on course with the last few changes—base damage past level 7 should be monitored closely, and scaling with gold should feel appropriately rewarding (and tied to success). if we ever _needed_ to go harder on her, i'd imagine it would be thinking of cool ways to replace her w spells that would give us more 'balance levers' while keeping her feeling great to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hey im joesu","date":"2015-10-23T21:01:31.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thoughts on Nami?
