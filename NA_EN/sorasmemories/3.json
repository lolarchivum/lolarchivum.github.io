Fighting in-lane against resource-less champions just feels unfair when you have a resource to manage. They can spam all day long and never worry about it. Mana (and to a degree energy Champs) are gated by both cooldowns and mana. I know this is all supposed to work out in how the rest of the kit is balanced, but play against a Riven or a Kat who never has to deal with going OOM and it just feels unfair.\n\n2. The amount of team coordination you need to shut down a Kat in a team fight before she does significant damage is... difficult in pub games. I feel like a lot of her (and Riven's) balance is based around team coordination countering them. Team coordination feels in short supply in pub games though. Really, it's not even about killing Kat or not, it's about killing her fast enough.\n\nNo hate for Kat or Riven players though.

Her poke is also very easy to land and has a decent range.\n\nThe real key though is that no matter how bad you screw her in laning once she hits lvl 6 she can just roam around and very easily get kills and assist and with just a little gold get the items to do insane damage and suddenly she goes from 0/3/0 to 5/4/4 or something like that.

She can go around your wards with shunpo. Your wards can get swept. You can be unable to place good wards because as you try to she kills you. Your plan can fail. Your team mates can fail in all these ways and more. Focusing her is often negated by one shunpo from her or just not always being grouped as 5 (and ALWAYS being grouped as 5 all game is unreasonable).\n\n\"If her damage is high enough then buy some Mr, you're not expected to go glass cannon and survive her dmg without a propper way to lock her in place, even then with some mr you should be doing fine, i rly doubt that is so complicated.\"\n\nOne of the main problems with this is that if you're a champion that uses mana you have to buy items for mana, CDR, AP/AD, and now vs Kat also MR. Kat doesn't have to buy mana, CDR, or MR most of the time. Sometimes she has to get one of those in addition to AP, still less than you do though to counter her.\n\nThe best counter to Kat is always team work, which is one reason she sees no play at the pro level (the other being the couple actual champion counters to her in lane). The lower ranked you are the worse team work you'll have on your side to counter her. It's not until about diamond rank that people can really be relied upon to reliably counter her with team work. Of course the game is mostly balanced around diamond level play though... so she stays largely unchanged. In the last month in ranked solo Q Kat was the 9th most banned champion and the only one besides Rek'sai to not get nerfed in the last 2-3 patchs (and Rek'sai is likely getting nerfed next patch). I can guarantee you the vast majority of those bans come from Bronze players where her ban rate is probably 90%+.\n\ntl;dr I'm not saying she's OP, I'm saying she's very frustrating to play against, especially for lower ranked players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bonfire10","date":"2015-06-30T18:48:19.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Plus she can poke back and without ever running out of mana, even if it isn't the strongest poke it's not exactly laughable damage.\n\nWhich means she's getting 0 cs considering she keeps harassing you and isn't ranged.

That's what the game is. If you're a carry and you're alone, you better have amazing vision coverage or you're about to die. Maybe that seems too punishing at lower levels of play, but that's what the game is when people know what they're doing. That's not even just true for kat or assassins. If you're carry is walking by an unwarded bush and there's an annie/xerath/yasuo/oriana/syndra/varus they're probably dead too.\n\n> Often her damage is so high that Kat kills you before your cc even finishes casting or reaching her.

You carries can deal damage safely while she is forced to just wait by, effectively making the fight a 4v5. If katarina tries to engage, leave. You're momentary lack of damage is less important than not dieing and giving her a reset. If she engages from a super long distance with flash shunpo, it means she either didnt Q, or is casting Q at her landing point and has to wait for the animation time. That's a significantly long enough time for reaction cc/shields/heals to go off.

She shunpos to get there faster too and is good at diving, so even if they play a little safe she might get them. The mere fact that they have to play safer due to her being in the game is part of her power, though yes that's a common thing among assassins.\n\n\"So everyone on your team will have to play League of Legends O_O? That's what the game is. If you're a carry and you're alone, you better have amazing vision coverage or you're about to die.\"\n\nThe key difference is the speed and mobility at which she can get there. VS Syndra or Annie or Xerath your carry can rely on vision over actual walkways to be enough. That's one of the reasons people hate the high mobility many champions have now. High damage champions that can easily and often get over walls create a much higher pressure around the map and increase the amount of vision you need to be safe drastically. Kat's not alone in this for sure but when combined with the rest of her kit it puts her up there with LB and Zed in terms of speed crossing the map over any path and then deleting someone instantly and can still get back out alive.\n\n\"Then don't give her the opening to deal damage to you.

If you can't react within 0.5 seconds, you shouldn't be playing league.\"\n\nThere's so much wrong with all that where do I begin? Lets see... Melee? Her abilities all have a range, calling her melee is like calling Zed melee, he can kill you easily without ever having to auto attack you so that's just pointless to mention. They might out range her but they don't just have true sight on the whole map 24/7 and can't just choose to never be CCed. Also you can't control what your team mates do. No plays perfect 100% of the time, and Kat capitalizes on even the slightest misstep very hard. Sometimes she gets a speed boost from a team mate too. 0.5 seconds is shorter than the entire east coast of the US's ping, for many of us it's half our ping or less. Even when you have to react you can't always predict where she'll flash or shunpo to and your cc isn't always point-click, isn't always up, isn't always in range, ect. She does so much damage that shields and heals are almost never enough, especially since her ult lessens heals.\n\n\"What are you smoking? 3.5 of her abilities require her to be in range of even the closest targeted spells. Her ult and W have low enough range for warwick Q to hit them.

Try throwing it at a halfway decent frontline alistar, he'll see the animation start and flash pulverize you during the animation time then knock you back into his team.\"\n\nAnd what if she shunpo's to something behind Alistar when he flashes and then she just deletes the ADC because they can't peel her on their own and their flash is down? You can come up with counters to every single champions actions by throwing in another certain champion (especially with flash up) to deal with it. That doesn't mean what the first champion can do isn't powerful and capable of working most of the time.\n\nAnnie can try to stun Kat with her Q and Kat can ult then zhonya's in response and kill 3 people because of the travel time on Annie's Q. That doesn't make Annie underpowered or Kat overpowered on its own. And more importantly this thread isn't about Kat being overpowered. It's about her being frustrating to play against. Even when you beat Kat she's often still frustrating to play against, much more so than most champions.\n\n\"Well I agree, due to resets. You could take any kit and apply it 5 times over to make it overpowered, no ones arguing that. The point is even if katarina with resets is the strongest champion in the game, a katarina without resets is one of the weakest champions in the game except against poor team comps or poor play.\"\n\nWhile I disagree with your conclusion anyways, the important thing is that Kat can easily get resets, even if she fails. Being able to reset off assists, especially that amount of resetting, is just stupidly annoying. Every champion in the game with a reset can be rather annoying at times due to that reset, Kat is the absolute queen of resets.","replies":[{"poster":"bonfire10","date":"2015-07-01T14:21:23.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Actually she can easily poke you while CSing with her Q. She can also CS with her other abilities. Backing lets her easily catch up in CS if she's down a little because she doesn't have to back unless you're poking her out, which you probably aren't because shunpo dodges most of it so easy in many matchups.\n\nIf she's poking you with Q, she's in range to be poked back, and your spells do more than hers because she has terrible base damages and ratios. If she shunpos to dodge a skillshot, it has a longer cd than any poke spell you just threw out. She also loses all lane pressure because she can neither commit to all ins or retreat from fights/jungler ganks for the next 12 seconds. During this time she should be zoned from attempting to take any cs by your basic kit, which will easily half health her in one rotation of basic spells regardless of your champion. The only other spell she can cs with is W, which is close enough range that you can easily punish if you're actually paying attention to your minion health and where she'll make the attempt. \n\nIf she's Csing with Q, as she should be forced to do, she not only isn't harassing you, but she's actively pushing the lane. It's similar to tristana, she can't kill a minion without pushing the wave, which means she can't freeze. Even if you suck at freezing lane, katarina is forced to give you multiple tries by constantly slightly shoving lane. \n\n>\"well sure, it's targeted, so are a lot of much better spells\"\n\n>Such as?\n\nAnnie Q, Vlad Q+E, Anivia E, Brand E, Malzahar E, Cass E, Kass Q, Kennen mark infused attack, Leblanc Q+R, Swain Q+E, Viktor Q, Teemo Q.\n\nKatarina's poke damage is capped by being manaless, having resets, being multihit, and having the second mark component. It is outclassed in both damage, utility, and CC by the majority of AP carry ranged targeted spells. Even when accounting for the secondary mark damage, which is completely unsafe to go in and proc, Q still provides less damage than many of the spells mentioned above. \n\n\n>\"it has a pretty average if not sub par range for a targeted ability... \"\n\n>Actually due to its ability to bounce to you off minions it's one of the longest range targeted abilities up there with Dark Wind from Fiddlesticks.

You simply being out of range of your minions forces kat to decide between harass or cs. She can't do both, not with the lane presence any decent midlaner will put on her. Not to mention the fact that only 60% of it's already minimal damage is going to remain by the time it reaches the end of it's bounces. \n\n\n>Her laning phase isn't actually that bad.

The mere fact that they have to play safer due to her being in the game is part of her power, though yes that's a common thing among assassins.\n\nHer laning phase is the worst of all assassins and has only 2 winning matchups. The vast majority are heavily in the other midlaner's favor with a few being close to an even skill matchup. Her speed should be irrelevant if you have a single ward between midlane and botlane or just a slight amount of map awareness. Bot lane playing safe isn't a detriment to your team. While they're playing safe and maybe not capitalizing on all they could or missing more cs, katarina is missing cs, experience, tower damage, map control, and vision control by trying to roam and giving up her position mid. Not to mention this all comes with the possibility of a counter gank, which your team could easily set up if she's following the trend of: push in lane - roam bot lane. Kat's risking a huge amount by roaming, especially when she can't rely on going back to a passive farming lane to catch up. \n\n\n>The key difference is the speed and mobility at which she can get there. VS Syndra or Annie or Xerath your carry can rely on vision over actual walkways to be enough. That's one of the reasons people hate the high mobility many champions have now. High damage champions that can easily and often get over walls create a much higher pressure around the map and increase the amount of vision you need to be safe drastically. Kat's not alone in this for sure but when combined with the rest of her kit it puts her up there with LB and Zed in terms of speed crossing the map over any path and then deleting someone instantly and can still get back out alive.\n\nI understand your point if you're talking about her just flashing over a wall in a jungle teamfight to reach your backline. But if that's the case, your team shouldn't be fighting in enclosed spaces with little vision. That's the optimal scenario for katarina and assassins in general. You also shouldn't get caught stuck in a linear path against a rumble or clump up together against an amumu + malphite + oriana team. \n\nBut outside this scenario, I don't see how your team would reasonably be caught out in a lane with no vision on either side while a katarina flanks you. If kat is getting behind your team, you have poor vision control. This doesn't mean warding 100% of the map, this means vision should move with your team. Wards should be preemptively placed in a bubble around your team as it advances or retreats, while keeping in mind that any bush that you're about to ward could have a full team in it if you don't already have vision of them. \n\nIt also sounds like you're saying katarina uses ward+shunpo to normally traverse the map. This doesn't happen, not to the extent you're making it sound. She isn't a nidalee or a kassadin traversing the map with a short cd jump. She isn't leblanc or fizz or zed who have other defensive options if they are caught in a bad situation after they jump. She isn't a Lee sin or a reksai who are tanky enough to survive a bad situation after they jump. If katarina uses her shunpo to just jump over walls to roam bot lane, she is giving up a 12 second window where she has very little killing power, and even less living potential if any champion besides the support shows up. Again, I'm not talking about her just ward hopping over walls onto your adc or shunpoing to minions in her own lane to be more mobile. I'm addressing what sounds like you claiming her shunpo allows her to traverse the map and create more pressure when her shunpo's realistic potential is contained pretty close to where her targets are. Shee needs to have shunpo up when she's within range of her targets, her entire kit depends on it. She isn't using it for mobility towards her target nearly as much as most other mobile assassins. Not to mention it's also optimal for her to max it last and also she doesn't build cdr items, so her shunpo is still on a 12 second cd until around level 13. \n\n> There's so much wrong with all that where do I begin? Lets see... Melee? Her abilities all have a range, calling her melee is like calling Zed melee, he can kill you easily without ever having to auto attack you so that's just pointless to mention.\n\nWhat? What does being melee have to do with auto attacking or not? That's like saying syndra isn't ranged because she doesn't really auto attack much when rotating through her spells. Zed and Katarina are both melee, this comes with a disadvantage in lane of needing to CS either with abilities, or by putting yourself in danger and taking free harass. I've explained above how kat CSing with her Q is detrimental to her lane control and how W is just as punishable as auto attacking for CS. \n\n> They might out range her but they don't just have true sight on the whole map 24/7 and can't just choose to never be CCed. \n\nYou don't need vision to know what you don't have vision of. For some reason the default mind set of a lot of players is \"I don't have vision of the whole team, I guess I have no information of those other champions\". You might not have vision of someone, but that doesn't mean you don't have any information about their position. You don't know where they are, but you do know where they aren't. If you can't see a katarina farming top lane while there are 4 of her teammates pushing down mid, maybe you can make the assumption that she's probably close by to them, maybe in that top side bush that you don't have warded. The point is you shouldn't be forcing fights when you don't have vision, and you shouldn't be baited into fighting and just blindly hoping that the enemy katarina isn't competent. You need to regain position and vision through map control, you can't just fight back and complain about a katarina capitalizing on improper vision when you were aware you had improper vision. \n\nThe CC argument is just stupid. If you're getting CCd and you're low enough or squishy enough to die to a katarina, you're certainly low enough or squishy enough to die to any other assassin, ap carry, or fighter. Does katarina snowball more damage off of that kill than the other mentioned categories? Yes. Does that your team would only have lost against the kat? No, every other category has plenty of ways to exploit a 4v5 even if they aren't as strong as a katarina with resets. And this is balanced by the fact that katarina is even weaker than those other categories of champions until she gets that reset. You can see how that would be frustrating at a higher level of play where stupid little mistakes aren't made as often. People complaining about how overpowered a champion is when they get that first reset, and you're sitting there thinking, \"How in the hell is anyone giving her an opening for a single reset?\" Shutting down katarina in lane, in roaming, and in teamfights is so simple and flowchart, people just don't take the time to learn how to actually play against her and complain to get her nerfed instead because it's easier than actually growing as a player.
