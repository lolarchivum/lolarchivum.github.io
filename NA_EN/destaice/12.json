Each player picks one.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":252,"down_votes":15,"body":"It's been many years since League was released back in 2009, and many changes have come before it.\r\n\r\nBut one factor that has been a constant is the ranked system's banning phase. 1 player on your team is chosen to ban 3 champions. It was fine back then, but problems exist now and such a system leaves a bitter taste.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we need to address the ban amount. Why is it limited to 3 per team? It was back in 2012 when people started asking for a 4th ban, and with reason.\r\n\r\n6/123 champions. Don't you think that's a tad small? There are around 20 current champions which are considered the problem children, so why let 14 instances of \"unhealthy\" champions get past the gates?\r\n\r\nFor the first change, we need to increase this number to 10. 5 bans for team. Sure some unhealthy champions are still getting passed, but at least you're able to limit to better to what can be counterpicked more easily. But, we can't let this be put in the hands of a single player.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that one person decides the bans? Why is it that one person decides which champions your team might be facing against?\r\n\r\nThe issue with this is that you're putting faith into 1 person knowing who/what to ban that would be optimal for your team. And in truth it just doesn't work out. The bans shouldn't be determined by 1 person, it should be determined by everyone on your team. After all, it is a team game.\r\n\r\nInstead of just throwing them all at one person and hoping they do good, we give each player a ban. One by one everyone will decide who to ban. Everyone can get rid of a champion they wont feel comfortable playing against. Everyone can feel like they're being a part of the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2015-01-31T03:00:14.449+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"We have been asking for this for a while and I think it is just common sense.
