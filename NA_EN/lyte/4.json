You can read more about it here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/upgrading-tribunal\r\n \r\nIn the meantime, we've launched several test systems that have begun aggressively reducing negative player behaviors in League of Legends including a system with the ability to instantly escalate high severity behaviors such as excessive verbal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and worse to a 14-day or permanent ban. After several weeks of testing in North America, we are now ready to start these tests on the European servers. We'll continue to monitor the results of these tests as we prepare to roll them out in other regions.\r\n \r\nThe reason I'm here today though, is because while these systems are effective at reducing *negative verbal behaviors* in League, we've been working on ways to address *negative gameplay behaviors* in League.\r\n \r\nStarting 8/26/2014 in North America, we’ll be rolling out a test system capable of immediately escalating extreme intentional feeders straight to a 14-day or permanent ban. Like our other punishment systems, we’ll start with conservative tests to minimize false positives, and then expand the system to be more aggressive. As with our other experiments, depending on the results, we’ll roll out similar tests to the other servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-08-27T01:38:52.995+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"How confident are you in the systems ability to discern between an intentional feeder, and a player on tilt?","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2014-08-27T01:40:20.769+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":46,"body":"Doesnt matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-08-27T01:42:07.113+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"So anyone who has a terrible game playing a champion for the first time and goes 0-10, deserves to be permabanned?","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2014-08-27T03:59:00.844+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"We'd rarely (if ever) ban a player for having one poor game--we may ban a player if it's super, extremely obvious they were intentional feeding in one game.

Another way to know is simply by seeing how many turret deaths they have! There should be a way to track that. \n\nSide note. Pantheon feeders jumping into turrets to feed, and other times pantheon plays could think they're strong enough to secure a squishy kill. i Witnessed this in ranked a few times. A pantheon feeder would drop on top of mid turret and TRY to get the kill, even though he never did. He kept typing stuff like Awww mann i tootallyyy almost gott himm!!!!11!!!.. So even though he intentionally fed and cost them the game, he did have like 8 kills and 22 deaths end game; How could you know it was intentional? (even though it was)","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2014-08-28T13:38:41.203+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really the problem.  I've seen a few strait up intentional feeders who just strait up go 0/XX.\n\nMost of the intentional feeders I've run into are much more ... cleaver about it to the point that it's often hard to be certain it's intentional at all.\n\nRecently, for example, I had a player who announced in pre-game chat that they would feed and make us lose.  Once game started they went 0/6 using tp to feed every lane 2 kills.  This, obviously, made it very hard for mid and bot to win lane since they were down 600 gold by minute 5.\n\nAfter that they started playing cleanup jumping into nearly ended fights to grab every kill they could (all our abilities being on cd and theirs being fresh) and then either die from chancing or suicide to turret within 10 seconds.  This did 3 things:  Took gold from us so we had even less chance, fed more kills to the enemy, and gave them a kda betterish then some of us who were actually trying to win.  During the entire match they said nothing in chat at all.\n\nSo in post game they had a kda around 7/20/0 while some of us who had been honestly trying to win were left with kda like 0/10/X.  This feeding player had one of the highest gold totals on our team because they had the majority of our kills and csed very well when not feeding.  Their build was legit, they needed as much power as possible to cleanup kills on us.\n\nSo I'm really curious how this system can differentiate this kind of feeder from someone who tries hard but dose badly or someone who starts out winning their lane with some early kills but then dies over and over to the fed enemy carry.  Even as a human watching the game unfold I'd have been unsure they were feeding if they hadn't announced it in pre-game chat.  They could have just been bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiropat","date":"2014-08-29T03:02:15.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they do have access to \"heatmaps\" and know when and where every death happened. if you are 0/6 by 10 min in they know you fed every lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2014-08-29T03:44:20.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not unless they have a more detailed internal heat-map than the one in the game stats.

At 12 min he tried bot again and failed getting a 1 for 2 trade. At 15 he gets dived by Nassus while holding lane and dies top. Around 18 you and him catch lulu and rammus setting up for drag?/rotating bot and get them both but can't press an advantage because Nassus {{summoner:12}} bot and took out your lane.\n\nIn another couple min he picks up a kill on Ram (who if you look at just k/d looks like he is feeding but based on the time charts seems to just be having a bad day) followed by Nassus 1v2 ing him and J4 (really?). He then catches fiddle trying to push top. 5 min later you guys win a bid team fight mid and finally get the first mid tower followed by your first dragon of the game (you guys are coming back from way behind at this point). \n\nAfter this there was one skirmish then you caught them out a drag and got an ace and basically one off that.\n\nSo how did I do based  off of our woefully inadequate info?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LackingDecency","date":"2014-08-27T08:39:35.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> We'd rarely (if ever) ban a player for having one poor game--we may ban a player if it's super, extremely obvious they were intentional feeding in one game.

Does a games K/D/A fall under a standard normal curve? If so, is the outlier of one player compared to the other elements of their score? Using 7 deaths as a figurative mean and 2.5 units as a standard deviation for individual scores of Ranked Solo games on NA; you run into the problem of having certain roles (support) falling on the outlier range for games played going - say, 0-15-7. I'm assuming that Kills and Assists are compared as well, so does that mean this system looks at potential history of said player? Do you create individual Curves for each player, then decide for an outlier? Do you go off of previous reports? Repeat offenders? Or is there a bias against those who have been punished for other reasons? Do you look for certain qualities such as current rank, games of ranked played, or number of games played career?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GrinningGhost","date":"2014-08-27T08:38:06.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will the system account for death-related strategies ala proxy singed or tp/revive karthus?

The issue is \"**What if someone happens to be on a bad streak?**\"\n\nEverybody is bound to lose a few games in a row. Considering that, imagine someone in ranked having a string of bad games where they died 6+ times per game and acquire intentional feeding reports that aren't justified. Can you safely say that these don't matter? Even if this poor sod's streak goes for ~10 games and he gets 3-4 reports per game? You think that's unlikely? Some people start raging and calling feeder when people are 0/2/0, even if there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nThis isn't to discredit the system, it is a legitimate question about how accurate it will be because shit happens and the last thing we need is a flood of posts/threads about ban appeals because of false positives.","replies":[{"poster":"burdluver90","date":"2014-08-27T14:27:55.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly certain that by large data set - Lyte is referring to things beyond KDA.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that you're trying to lose the game when you buy 6 boots. \n\nIt's pretty obvious that you're intentionally feeding when you were playing a normal (but bad game) then start dying every 30s-1m. Even if you're playing badly - you won't be just running out of base and dying immediately for the rest of the game.\n\nThey also have chat logs. There is a lot to be said for one comment of \"i'm gonna feed\". The same 0-13 game is cast in a lot different light if you talk about feeding or afking than if you apologize for making mistakes.\n\nLikewise, they have access to lobby and post game chat (just because it's not in the tribunal doesn't mean Lyte can't find it). If you were mad that someone took your preferred role and then went 0-13 without saying anything in game - that's different than saying \"first time X\" and going 0-13. \n\nThey can also tell how many objectives you helped with, how much you warded and how often you were with your team (through assists). If you're the support and are 0-13-15 with several tower and dragon assists and many wards placed - that's different than the 0-13-3 mid with no wards and no objective assists.\n\n\nLastly, they have player statistics. If you have 1000 games that you tried in - few reports, around a 50% win rate - but you generally have a bad KDA. Let's say you average 1.5. You'll go something like 5-10-10 in a game. Now you have a 0-15-1 game. That's pretty out of the ordinary for you. If they notice weird things in the other categories I mentioned - then it's probably a case of feeding. But that's just one case - they won't ban you for doing it once. \n\nNow, let's assume you have 1000 games, but your performance is really up and down. Some of the time you have great 20-3-6 games, some times you have 0-12 games. Let's also say that during those 0-12 games, you averaged a high number of reports and had very unusual or flat out troll (6 tears, 6 boots, etc) builds. Now let's say you go 0-15-1 in a game. This is more likely intentionally feeding. And since your account seems to have a history of it - you're probably going to get banned quicker. \n\nTL; DR\n\nLyte and the player behavior team have access to EVERYTHING that happens in game and in pre and post game chat. If you can tell the difference between an intentional feeder and someone having a bad game - they can too. They are not just using one stat or looking at one game - they have all the data on you that you can imagine.

It was battle of who could feed better.\n\n\nIt does happen and it's not excusable and is ban worthy in my opinion. I've seen perfectly winable games go from having a disadvantage (someone is behind in lane) to being completely thrown away (because that person now fed 10+ kills to the carry). It's not intentionally feeding to just be bad - but it is intentional if you run straight at them again and again with the intent to die. \n\nSince this is a team game you should never feed on purpose. So what if you're doing poorly - so what if you're mad? AFKing is better than feeding (because it's not putting the other team farther ahead) and people are always up in arms about that.\n\nI don't see how this is a terror regime. It's part of the summoner's code to continue to help your team for the whole game \"so don't leave the game or go AFK! Encourage players who are having trouble, and congratulate those who are playing well. And most of all, if you're having a bad game don't take it out on your team!\"\n\nThey are 100% right to punish players for this behavior. And in the cases of this I've seen, it's the TOXIC ASSHOLE that's doing it. It's not the guy who was quiet, just having a bad game that was harrassed and now decides \"fuck you all I'm going to feed\" - It's the guy who's been complaining about everything all game - saying his team sucks - berating other people and then decided that he hates his team so much he wants them to lose. \n\nAgain - it's never okay to intentionally feed.

It's also easy enough to ping spam and things like sarcasm and context are never readable from the chat log.\n\nExample:\nAkali is doing great and getting tons of multikills and doing sick out plays.\n\nI say stuff like \"man, this akali\", \"gg\", \"gj\", \"amazing\", \"teach me master\" - I'm being a really positive player.\n\nNow, akali is doing terribly - diving in and dying, failing to secure kills, making really stupid mistakes (missing Q/R)\n\nI say stuff like \"man, this akali\", \"gg\", \"gj\", \"amazing\", \"teach me master\" - I'm being a sarcastic dickwad.\n\nThe current chat banning system flags racism, homophobia, threats and other \"severe\" language. It won't catch just being an asshole as long as you avoid cussing and slurs. \n\nIntentionally feeding (it is very obvious when it's intentional and when it's not) is never a grey area.

It appears as if there would be a LARGER room for error.","replies":[{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-08-27T02:03:36.028+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would be most severely disappointed and shocked if permanent bans were assigned from a system, and not human hands.","replies":[{"poster":"MaknBacnPancakes","date":"2014-08-27T02:18:35.665+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As would I...\n\nIntentional feeding as per the tribunal system as I understand it..

I don't think that a person who is being toxic and/or spiteful and feeds kills when the game/team/teammate rubs them the wrong way can be tracked easily except by human feedback to humans.\n\nI have also seen instances where a person started off poorly, and got so badgered by teammates that they just stop caring and stop trying..
