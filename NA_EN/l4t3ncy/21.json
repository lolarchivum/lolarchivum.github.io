The modes you&#039;ve seen so far represent the widest spread of gameplay with strong engagement, which is why we chose them first. With that said, any game mode that we&#039;ve previously done is a potential candidate for the RGM queue, so if your favourite mode isn&#039;t in there yet, there&#039;s a chance we could get to it sometime in the future.\r\n\r\n**&quot;The time between reappearances of modes is too long/short. It should be shorter/longer.&quot;**\r\nAs you might suspect, this changes mode to mode and player to player, depending on what they like. We are interested though in seeing differing cadences could look like. For example, we currently have about 6 weeks between modes reappearing, but maybe we could shorten that to 4 weeks letting us focus on bigger updates to particular  modes on a slightly longer cadence.

I'm dying for draft pick URF especially, but I think it should be considered for any mode you pick your champs.  A chance to mitigate what you're up against instead of rolling a die to see whose OP counters whose is so helpful.  The side effect of mirror matches being disallowed enforces a higher minimum variety each game, and mirror matches are largely unpleasant for the game in general anyway.

Everyone has had those horrible URF games where one team picks fun/non-meta URF champions and the other picks 5 of the broken champions and the game is obviously over by 5 minutes because one team is completely unable to deal with the other. A lot of that happens because the team picking the strong champions just assumes that they have to (people don't want to risk picking weaker champions if they suspect they'll be facing the meta picks) and as someone who's been on both sides of that, I usually feel really rubbish if I'm the one with pretty good champions destroying the enemy team's fun. What can I do about it though? If I hadn't picked those champions I would have had zero chance of dealing with someone like Hecarim or Zed on the enemy team.\n\nIf you make it draft you remove the \"I need to be able to deal with anything\" fear of URF. If you see the enemy picks people who are poor/average in URF then you can choose fun picks too, and if you see them picking strong champions then you can pick them too. You'd have more variety in picks because one of the primary drives for picking broken champions (\"The enemy might have them too\") is gone and you remove the \"I got stomped through no fault of my own\" problem too - if you lose in champ select it'll be because you didn't make good use of/ignored the information available to you, not because you got unlucky.\n\nOf course, draft could introduce other problems and maybe it being draft would make people take the game more seriously overall, but I still believe that people taking URF a bit more seriously than normal would cause a lot less anti-fun in champ select than the current blind factor does.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pentarina Only","date":"2016-06-08T20:53:08.554+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":75,"body":"When is Fizz's ultimate getting gutted?","replies":[{"poster":"Pentarina Only","date":"2016-06-08T21:03:12.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":60,"body":"Why the fuck did I get so many downvotes?","replies":[{"poster":"Fisherman Fízz","date":"2016-06-08T21:07:44.441+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because this is not the place to ask for nerfs or when they nerf X champion","replies":[{"poster":"Kerchner12","date":"2016-06-09T02:24:47.880+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"How approperiate +1 Fizz.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagmaDragon12","date":"2016-06-08T20:38:50.118+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"With there being a rotation on weekend gamemodes, could we get a rotation on the ARAM map between Howling Abyss one week, then Butcher's Bridge the next week?","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2016-06-08T20:58:53.569+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know there are Rioters who passionately want to resurrect the Butcher's Bridge map (I personally thought it looked pretty sweet) on ARAM is some way!
