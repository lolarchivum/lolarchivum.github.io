When people have suggested achievements in LoL, the general (and correct) response has always been: \"No, in League there is a single goal, and adding any additional goal will corrupt the game at its core.\"\nNow, with the new game mode, Riot has done exactly that. They have created a game with a clear goal for every player: Reach 200 points, but in addition to that, they have decided to reward players for doing something else.\nTo get the icon, a team needs to win a game without the enemy ascending a single time. They have created a situation in which people are playing the mode solely for the icon, and since failure is irreversible (once the enemy ascends it's over), there is no point in continuing playing the game, because the icon was the reason the player started the game to begin with.\nThis creates a lot of negativity, since every game there's a clash of A) people trying to win, and B) people trying to get the icon. Once getting the icon is no longer possible, group B) will be in a state of defeat, while A) is still trying to win the game.\nSomething needs to change because honestly, ruining a great game mode by adding some random icon is a damn shame.","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2014-09-18T17:36:05.427+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"We often hear from players that they would like more ways to express their skill level visually; in particular, wishing there was more value tied intrinsically to things like summoner icons. For example, during the Doom Bots of Doom, many players actually expressed disappointment at the Doom Ziggs icon being *too easy* to get, devaluing it, and wishing it would have been locked behind beating the 5-bomb difficulty.\n\nThe 'Perfect Ascension' icon stems from us wanting to try making a 'challenge mode' icon to reward exceptional play. It had to reflect an actual gameplay achievement. Being a 'challenge', it is of course not compulsory by any means, and if it were too easy, it would have no value right? The icon doesn't require any deviation from regular Ascension play strategy, and happens naturally in the course of playing to win. You just need to win VERY convincingly (IE: play the **perfect** game).\n\nThe point you make about a possible disconnect between players expectations is true though, and we're taking this on board. Misaligned expecations of a game's win condition are probably creating the clash you describe. So we originally were going to make it an 'opt-in experience' and lock it to premade 5-mans, as not everyone might be equally bought in on trying to get it. This felt too limiting though, and we wanted to give everyone a chance to be rewarded for playing that 'perfect game'. We still expect serious players to gather a group of friends and try for it together though.\n\nThe temporary nature of Featured Game Modes let's us experiment with new things like this that might not be possible if they were more permanent. We can also learn from these things and let them inform any similar future design features.

I have played many games of ascension, probably close to 30 at this point but I'm not sure because I can't load my history for some reason, gotten close to getting the icon, but then the enemy team manages one lucky khazix jump right at the end when it's 190-120 and we lose it. In contrast, several of my friends have gone in on total randoms and gotten their perfect ascensions in the first 5 wins. Even when you have good communication and a decent team comp, the enemy team just has to get one lucky strike and suddenly several members of your team are no longer interested in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2014-09-18T19:34:35.795+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"If the fight comes down to a scrap at Xerath, that's already an uncontrolled situation and doesn't really sound like a 'perfect game'. :/ Good teams don't leave it to chance at a Xerath fight.

The perception of the current 'assassin meta' being the strongest and \"absolutely a MUST PICK\" is interesting. :) There is a cluster of assassins that are seeing an ungodly amount of bans, and yet almost ALL of them have a sub 50% win ratio.

Yes!\n\n2. Nope! =)  In all seriousness, a lot of these ideas are unproven and unbaked - even Ascension went through several iterations before we landed on what we have now.  Teasing a mode that we end up not delivering because it wasn't fun isn't great (and I know we've been guilty of this in the past, sorry).  But rest assured that we have several ideas in the backlog!\n\n3.  The goal of the Ascension buff was to make someone burn bright and fast.  Camping the Ascended felt really bad for a team that comes out of a clutch Ascended fight down a champion or two, and making the Ascended more tanky felt directionally off for what we wanted the Ascended to be - a powerful combat participant with a strong but temporal advantage.  The knockback gives the Ascended player more strategic options upon appearing, but at the same time doesn't give a free pass to a player that steals it from a team 1v5 - it's quite doable to hang out back and murder the Ascended with great prejudice once he appears when he's in the midst of 5 players.\n\n4. Teleporting in felt like a cool way to get players into the action - we wanted to center the experience around skirmishing and objectives.  Retreating and escaping is unbecoming of the Ascended and his followers!  Teleporting in allowed us not only to close off this avenue of unhealthy combat-adverse gameplay, but also to get players into the action faster, as well as providing new strategic decisions for engaging in combat.  Do I teleport close to the team fight that's happening to try to take down the enemy Ascended, or go to a point further away and try to take a relic while everybody's busy?\n\n5.
