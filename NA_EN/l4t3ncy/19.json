However, we draw the line in extreme cases: when a champ can permanently stun an enemy (literally, in the old, non-figurative sense), or when a mode&rsquo;s fundamental nature makes a champ unplayable. EG: Tahm Kench on U.R.F. and Brand in One For All could permastun without changes, and Bard on U.R.F. needed a faster chime spawn rate just to play the same mode as everyone else.\nNot all champions are expected to be equally viable in all rotating modes. Champions are designed and balanced around SR. In RGMs, there&rsquo;ll usually be a few over- or under-performers, and we&rsquo;re comfortable with that given the rotating nature of the queue.\n\n**RE specific URF balance suggestions**\nFor URF in particular I saw balance suggestions raised more than usual (probably due to the snowballiness of the mode, low skill-floor and high skill-ceiling). For champion specific stuff, we would still follow the 2 rules outlined above, so let&#039;s talk about some of the other suggestions that were bandied around.\n-- Towers should shoot faster/do more dmg.\n-- Death timers should be lower.\n-- Homeguards should switch on quicker.\n\nIn general, all 3 of these suggestions would increase game length (potentially by A LOT) and that&#039;s not something we want to do. Wave clear is pretty easy in URF, and we&#039;re hesitant to increase champ uptime that would make stalling out games any easier. RE death timers in particular, compared to URF last year, we have a ~3sec increase @20 mins. While this is mathematically almost insignificant, URF&#039;s gameplay probably exacerbates any feelings of _&quot;This is taking forever!&quot;_ (this is no different from last year though). Next time around on URF, we might explore some soft tweaks to alleviate these feels, but only if they won&#039;t dramatically increase game length.\n\n**Why RGM only on weekends / why only 3 days?**\nWe realise that some players work on weekends, and we want to get to a spot that extends the queue into the week ASAP. Right now though, the vast majority _are_ able to jump in on the weekends, and it&#039;s the best environment right now for us to tweak the queue in. We&#039;re still keeping an eye on RGM before widening windows, but our goal remains unchanged to increase your guy&#039;s facetime with more modes, more of the time, each week.\n\n**Mode X where?**\nWe&#039;re still forging the path atm with this stable of modes, and haven&#039;t even begun the first loop (Ascension returning soon though for the first time!) The modes you&#039;ve seen so far represent the widest spread of gameplay with strong engagement. We&#039;ll consider other modes once the loop is up and running.\n\n**NURF mode where?**\nNo... ..no.... ..............................no :(\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHexakill: TT is up next this weekend! I&#039;m also chilling in this thread to field any other questions. ^_^b\n--- L4T3NCY","replies":[{"poster":"CoolMike127","date":"2016-04-27T20:58:23.417+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":3,"body":"Any signs of **Doom Bots** on the radar?","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2016-04-27T21:02:05.502+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":1,"body":"We really enjoyed making Doom Bots (even though it was probably the most script intensive mode we've ever made. o.O) Once RGM has been running for a while it's one we might consider.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-04-27T22:06:11.388+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":4,"body":"consider random for urfmode? because last time it got stale after 3 games because all you see is zed and fizz etc etc\n\nurf being random might just make it a bit less tryhard. people seem to be more focused on winning and stomping then in actual ranked.\n\nAnd ofc everyone wants to win but there is no fun in it with all the super broken champs every game becomes won in champselect which isnt a good sitaution imho","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2016-04-28T01:02:08.331+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"I volunteer as scripting tribute!

Losing champ pick agency would remove this.\n\nOn the flipside, we appreciate that seeing the same cadre of champs on a high frequency can be a bit bleh (a problem SR also battles against). I don't think simply increasing the number of bans is a good solution, as it just shifts the problem down to the next group of champs. Another suggestion is to nerf the popular OP champs, but we already know that even when they're quite weak, certain champs still see continuously high pick rates because they're just fun to play (win-rate and pick-rate rarely correlate in the alternate game modes. *cough* Katarina *cough* :P).\n\nThis also isn't a problem unique to just URF, all modes (SR included) contend with this issue.

There has to be some sort of trade off and currently most of the \"fun\" had in URF is on the players of the \"better\" champions while the receiver just has to kind of bend over and take it.\n\nMaking it all random I feel would have a better chance of success than actual ARAM since (imho) there are realistically no \"bad\" picks like say....Garen on ARAM.
