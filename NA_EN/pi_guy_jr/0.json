I believe the nerfs to her Q are justified, less killing potential in lane but returns to normal at level 9 which is better than just a straight nerf at all levels. \n\nHowever...Riot's team really messed up somewhere when they messed with her E. I admit there have been times where I didn't think that stun hit them but it did. My complaint with the change to her E is that it's completely bugged right now. I had a game where my stun literally went through a Jarvan as he was performing his QE combo and nothing happened to him. Syndra went from being a completely viable champion to a subpar mage who retains her burst but not her only form of safety which lies in her stun. I can't even play my favorite champion anymore because her stun...it just doesn't work right now. \n\nOverall, I can live with the Q changes.
