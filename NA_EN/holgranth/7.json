The new Akali is a perfect example of this when taking into account her passive, and I think she can serve asa basis for future Assassin updates.\n\nThe cool thing is that this delay can happen at any time in combat, such as right before as a trap set up, or during combat as the assassin prepares to go in for a final blow. Additionally it doesn't have to be a HARD delay, but their kit can encourage a delay as Akali's does.\n\nThe MOST important thing is that this delay is MEANINGFUL thats why LeBlanc's update failed/was reverted, she had a delay but she didn't have anything to do while she waited...and neither did the opponent except run away which is basically what the delay told the opponent to do. \nIts also why Kat's Update can be seen as a success, yes she has to wait for her daggers to fall but both she and her opponent can position around where the daggers will fall, and they were able to increase her mobility as reasonable compensation. Same goes for Talon's W, Evelyn W, Ekko W, Kass E, Kayn W, Noct E.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Seigsss","date":"2018-08-16T20:54:34.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just saying this the other day.

A mage, not an assassin. Think of Rumble's harpoon, just you can choose which of the two is the real one and which one is fake. Or Shaco's clone, just you can switch between which one will you use. Currently, only her passive is a real illusion, what the hell..\n{{champion:107}} - A lion goes for weak or isolated targets.. doesn't dive into the crowd. Steal kha`s passive, he is a praying mantis.. he should go for an attempt to get a hold of his target and then deal massive damage, the isolated target fits Rengar better. His roar could be a debuff to the enemy and not a forgiving buff to himself, a thing to terrify/demoralize.. not to convert him into frog-fish known as Tahm Kench. Focus towards ending the game early before the hunter becomes the pray. You lose power in the numbers..\n{{champion:105}} - I like his kit, I think they should play around the numbers. For example Trickster - Slightly lower cooldown but way less \"hang\" time [0.25s] and less damage? More about timing the trick rather than worrying if you are able to perform it or not. Passive maybe towards tenacity, a slippery fish, not reducing damage. Trident connected to landing the ultimate,  amplified by the fish you got [3 levels of fish/buff to the trident] - If you land it, you deserve the kill.

These mobile fighters should offer plenty of counterplay to their dive attempts.\n\nNeither class group should offer 100-0 burst without counterplay as its identity.  \n\nA fed/skilled trickster should be able to reliably pop straight into the enemy back line, burst 30-50% of the hp on a squishy carry and get out freely without much counterplay, but they should lack the damage to ever take someone down in a fair fight from from 70%+ hp in one attempt, no matter how fed the trickster is.  If a squishy carry wanders into a Trickster's traps or becomes so far out of position that the Trickster has time to make several assassination attempts before the carry can get to safety, then the Trickster should win the fight, but it would be delayed into either multiple hit-and-runs or would include the trap prep/setup time on the Trickster's side to make it fair.  So Tricksters would be all about finding/creating opportunities and map control.  \n\nSkirmishers should have the damage to close in on and stick to a squishy carry and 100-0 duel them over a couple seconds (none of this 0.4 second bull shit), but they should be visible enough that they lack the element of surprise and can be coordinated against to CC them in a teamfight.  Skirmishers should have trouble reaching a back line without the help of an allied tank to engage for them.  To be fair, ranged carries such as mages and marksmen shouldn't be 100-0'ing fighters within <2 seconds either though, so the game as a whole needs to be rebalanced.\n\n{{champion:107}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:91}} seem to fit right in-between these two roles, so they should probably be able to dive in and kill a target at around 50% hp, but they should have a harder time disengaging and should have less map control than a more pure trickster assassin (who shouldn't be able to duel) like Shaco, Leblanc, and Evelynn.\n{{champion:105}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:91}} should be able to outduel a squishy carry in a prolonged fight if they get the opportunity, but it should be stretched out into something like 50% of the enemy's hp in up-front burst and the remaining 50% over 5 seconds of continued skirmishing, so they'd really only be able to \"burst\" assassinate if a target is already low on health.\n\nRanged burst mages who don't have an assassin identity that can be divided into either Trickster or Skirmisher groups should be reclassified as whatever the magic damage equivalent of a marksman is.  Burst vs DPS doesn't seem like a valid division to define a class, especially since how bursty/DPS oriented someone is depends so much on their particular build and how fed they are.  A lot of marksmen are pretty bursty too, but there isn't some arbitrary class division of \"burst marksmen\" and \"regular marksmen\" or \"CC marksmen\".  I think some of the burst mages could have their burst toned down a bit and could be reclassified as controllers too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2018-08-16T00:42:52.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They've been losing players.\n\nhttps://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-strained-relationship-tencent-declining-players-mobile-games-information-32079\n\nStraight up been surveyed.
