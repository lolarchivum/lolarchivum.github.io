I think everyone&#039;s hunch is correct that we&#039;re dealing more damage/we&#039;re squishier now, it&#039;s just to what degree. Something one of our analysts u/RiotBenobo might look into this week. We could look at things like game bloodiness (kills per game, when they occur, etc.), TTK (time to kill) especially at early levels, stuff like that.**\n\n**(2) Choice in old vs new runes - There are still defensive options in the rune system, it&#039;s just that now we have a lot of options that can also be optimal so we shy away from defensive ones. Splashing resolve secondary with bone-plating/chrysalis is kind of like your health/armor yellows and MR blues, but instead of being basically the only choice I think it&#039;s just a choice now. And frankly with a lot of champs we&#039;re more enticed by the spicy damage choices or other unique effects splash precision, dom, sorcercy, etc.**\n\n**That being said I think we still have a more offense-focused system than previously, and the defensive choices we give you aren&#039;t 100% go-to optimized like they were in the old system.**\n\n**(3) Pros vs Cons of higher lethality - I think in some cases the offense-focused new rune system may make some interactions and gameplay feel worse, but could improve it in other areas. I think this post only frames the cons of the current &quot;high lethality&quot; gameplay (if it really is even that high) without addressing some of the pros.**\n\n&quot;we don&#039;t know to what extent it&#039;s actually true&quot; My WHAT. How out of touch with the game are you? There are thousands of hours of video of previous seasons. Anyone with a half way working memory can tell you damage is higher than previous seasons. Tanks don&#039;t even function as damage soakers anymore. \n\nThere is a sweet spot between high and low lethality. But this season has gone WAY too far down the road of damage. The ONLY play style that is supported right now is high DPS, all in kill or be killed. Other styles used to be supported.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-07-27T01:39:45.791+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":5,"body":"Meddler, myself, Repertoir and Scruffy met on this topic earlier today.

From a pure data perspective, the amount of damage in the game isn't meaningfully higher than it has been in the past (and is actually down for some champs), the main difference is how much more frontloaded it is. Whether that be from Duskblade, Scorch, Aery etc, it's easier to apply reliable damage that amps your combat rotations or poke. That's an area where there's more division, on one hand higher damage ensures that fights conclude, that playing aggressively is rewarded and that playing purely defensively is easier to take advantage of. This is probably a bit spicy, but I personally believe that the Ardent Censer meta from worlds couldn't have existed this season  given that aggressive teams could have better taken advantage of the weaker earlier game of the team going for the AC rush (no vision, no hp from sightstone etc). Picking aggressive combos like Leo/Trist would have been a much better counter to the strategy. \n\nThat being said - and this is my opinion - I think there's probably a bit too much damage right now that lacks sufficient counterplay. I played against a Soraka yesterday in a playtest and her being able to apply both Aery and Scorch immediately to me with E doesn't feel particularly great. I don't want to get too deep into the weeds here though, since that's just my opinion - but hope that once we collect our thoughts next week we're able to give you a firmer stance and what/if we're going to do something.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisherman Fizz","date":"2018-07-27T03:18:00.204+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"I replied to Blau's post with something that sounded pretty similar to this, gonna copy/paste it here:\n\nI think perception is also a big part of it. On top of runes being a more offense focused system, there's also more power shifted from raw stats into new and visually more obvious effects like electrocute/aery/duskblade/etc.\n\nSo now when a Zed EQ autos you and you die, rather than him just having the raw stats to kill you, he's also procing electrocute/duskblade/other runes on you, which makes the PERCEIVED damage much higher, because you can visually see a bunch more sources of damage than before. Having more power concentrated into those kind of effects also makes it seem much more \"bursty\" and makes it feel like you have less time to outplay things.\n\nAlso, new runes and other offensive tools tend to break down lots of coubterplay options once someone is ahead. Using zed again just because he's one of the biggest offenders of this, once he's ahead he can R you, miss everything, E + auto you once with duskblade, ignite you, proc electrocute and you die. Even if you dodge his Q, when you just die anyway it feels like you got cheated, because you \"played well\" but died to these new offensive effects that you can't do much about.\n\nThis can also apply in lane with a lot of new runes as well. Get clipped by one Lux E? Well now you also take damage from comet/scorch/etc. as well. Even if this damage was even with what it did before, it FEELS like more because youre getting hit by several things now instead of just the E.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-07-27T03:21:41.265+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":5,"body":"This is a fantastic breakdown.

I'm sort of dreading the possibility of a Riot post explaining why damage is perfectly fine as-is, and I'm pre-emptively arguing against that conclusion.\n\nMy first reaction on preseason patch day was \"wtf is this damage?!\" Since then, I have spent a lot of time trying to answer my own questions and raise the matter in replies to reds. This has been my biggest complaint throughout all of season 8, and it's the thing I blame for my seriously degraded relationship with the game. I want to have more fun than I'm having right now.\n\nThere is a lot more equivocation in this thread than I expected, and it makes me nervous to think that the Riot response may be some form of \"this isn't a problem according to the metrics,\" \"it's a perception issue,\" \"it's because of the Spellthief supports,\" \"people are just playing higher-damage champs during preseason,\" or \"player surveys show that damage is just fine.\" If my experience is that this issue feels like an emergency, it's jarring to see responses that question whether a problem exists at all.\n\nI strongly suspect that this problem is not easily identified by metrics, otherwise it would have been on your radar long before now. The response, then, is to proactively look for ways to *validate* player complaints and presume that there may be a gap in the data or analytics that is causing this huge disconnect between Riot and players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-07-27T05:36:11.976+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree strongly. I don't think perception of multiple damage sources has anything to do with it at all (or if it does, it's hiding the creep). Perception obviously affects some aspects of how we feel about damage, but seeing me get hit by multiple things doesn't make me feel like I took more damage, taking more damage makes me feel like I took more damage.\n\nPeople have always had trouble perceiving how much damage they actually take from damage over time effects, often underestimating it. Which is why people often felt that DFT was doing far less than it really was. Single big hits stand out and make you really feel like you got hit hard. Three smaller hits that occur over a second or two likely has a similar effect, obscuring the fact that they've actually been hit very hard.\n\nThe current problem is that we die, and we die without feeling like we're able to actually do anything about it. And looking at your data has several issues showing that. Even if I do half the damage in a game that I did a year ago, I might do it earlier on and it can have more impact.\n\nPeople with less hp (whether due to runes/items/lower level) take less damage to kill. Also people living longer can increase damage done to them substantially because we're always regenerating hp. And things being very bursty encourages ultra safe play where no one hits each other for a while and then suddenly people die. So what metrics of damage are Riot looking at to see if we do more now than before? And how long ago?\n\nI get that Riot isn't going to give us a million charts with context explaining your full thoughts on the matter and I'm not actually asking you to. But please keep in mind while looking at the data that there is actually no single context-free metric anyone can look at and be certain that _effective_ damage creep isn't an issue. I can go over several of the reasons why if you want, but honestly I shouldn't have to, yet I'm deeply afraid that it would be beneficial.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2018-07-27T03:46:21.330+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K0b5fhnN,comment-id=00150001000100050001,timestamp=2018-07-27T03:21:41.265+0000)\n>\n> This is a fantastic breakdown.

Please don't fool yourself into thinking this is mostly about perception.  \n\n1) The new runes both increase damage and reduce durability for most champions, as they offer no defensive stats unless one takes Resolve in one of their two trees.  With the old system pretty much every champ had at least some defensive stats.\n\n2) Duskblade and Stormrazor, newer items that didn't exist in previous metas, absolutely lead to massive burst damage.  This has nothing to do with perception.  It's just a fact.\n\n3) Electrocute is much more powerful than Thunderlord's when it procs, leading to more 100-0 potential.  Even though it procs less often, the burst it offers is massively bigger.  Again, this is not about perception.

Is it total or p/s or by X minute, etc?  I ask because it is easy to see how damage has increased while certain metrics might say it has \"dropped\".  If you give everyone 1 billion damage AAs but then don't count damage beyond the kill amount then damage has obviously gone up but the stats will say it \"remained level\".  Likewise, if you're using \"total damage/game\" as a metric but games end faster because it's easier to kill enemies then your metric can show a decrease even though the damage was increased.  I'm assuming all that is completely accounted for and thus your calculation is more nuanced, but only hearing \"damage has gone down for some champs\" leaves me to assume that either you're being deliberately disingenuous (looking at obviously nerfed champs) or accidentally so (looking at a calculation that doesn't account for game impact and instead just reading flat numbers).  I do not think EITHER of those things is true, so I'm asking for clarification for your public benefit.\n\nRealistically I think the \"damage creep\" problem at its core is that the game FEELS bad now.  My PERSONAL opinion is that too many balance choices have taken League in a \"team deathmatch\" direction at the expense of the \"team strategy\" game that most people love.  If I have 2 people with paintball guns and 50 obstacles between them, then the game has a lot of nuance and planning in order to see how can beat the other utilizing the environment to their benefit.  If I drop the same two guys into any empty room 50' apart, it's a completely different game.  The \"damage\" has not changed, but the \"feel\" is entirely different.  Whether it is because of weak armor/MR, or overloaded damage, or even some weird tangent like excessive utility or lack of vision; I feel that \"burst\" is too strong in the game.  At the absolute, tip-top of the game, I think players can make the tiny micro adjustments necessary to modify the outcome DURING a big team fight, but I think for the VAST majority of players, once the team fight starts it's \"who unloads their full kit first to wipe you out\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2018-07-27T02:24:22.110+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"A great deal of the issue, including the example you just gave, came from Runes Reforged, and ultimately how much free, reliable power keystones give. \n\nJust something to think about for one of the potential future posts about damage.

Look at the average damage for Karthus or Teemo compared to Talon or Kha'zix. Now, which of those pairs has the faster TTK? \n\nIf Teemo's target is being heal spammed by Soraka, Teemo might deal two health bars of damage before getting a kill. If Talon deletes his target faster than the human response time, Soraka's not getting any heals off, and Talon only needs to deal one health bar to get a kill. \n\nI really think this is an example of where you guys are not seeing the forest for the trees. We know *for a fact* that all-in burst is up by looking at runes, patch notes, ignite buffs, etc. We also know that damage is further amplified by the plethora of % modifiers and multiplicative scalings in runes. The % multipliers were disproportionately found in the Precision tree and on ADC items, which is exactly what pushed them so far out of control.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-07-27T02:56:37.898+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully the post will address some (or any) of the things I mentioned in these posts from November through January.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Vekkna,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=AkdoqJg0,comment-id=0042,timestamp=2018-01-25T18:45:52.929+0000)\n>\n> Do you guys think any of these are problems with this season?\n> \n> * TTK is too low overall\n> * Ambient damage is high and frustrating (eg, comet, aery, scorch, cheap shot)\n> * Hybrid, AD, and tank magic damage is too high\n> * Item use/proc damage is too high (eg, gunblade, duskblade, titanic, shiv)\n> * High-damage meta indirectly boosting the relative power of cc/mitigation/immunity/untargetable duration without any change in the power budget of these skills.

There is a ton of ambient aoe and surprise burst.

This is all very predictable, but here we are.\n> \n> The trees are fundamentally imbalanced because you have the entire Precision tree dedicated to *multiplicative* stats and modifiers while the other trees provide additive damage with fixed ratios. When an ADC buys crit, attack speed, crit damage, and LDR, the Precision runes will cause them to scale out of control far earlier in the game. And of course, adaptive flat damage will make lethality-stackers overbearing the second they get a lead.\n> \n> Then there&#x27;s the problem of the stat rebalance, which served as a huge buff to ADs that deal magic damage but don&#x27;t itemize for it at all.

Splashing resolve secondary with bone-plating/chrysalis is kind of like your health/armor yellows and MR blues, but instead of being basically the only choice I think it&amp;#039;s just a choice now. And frankly with a lot of champs we&amp;#039;re more enticed by the spicy damage choices or other unique effects splash precision, dom, sorcercy, etc.**\n> \n> **That being said I think we still have a more offense-focused system than previously, and the defensive choices we give you aren&amp;#039;t 100% go-to optimized like they were in the old system.**\n> \n> **(3) Pros vs Cons of higher lethality - I think in some cases the offense-focused new rune system may make some interactions and gameplay feel worse, but could improve it in other areas.

I don't advocate for the reckless mocking of people, not even close. But when something is absurd then the appropriate response, at least in cases like this of a mass of people without power towards a smaller group with power, is to in fact mock.\n\n>but it's been addressed.\n\nExcept that it hasn't been.

While it's great that _at last_ they're actually talking about it for real (and to the players even!) it's still terrifying that they're uncertain about it. They should be neck deep in data and testing, figuring out just how drastically changes need to be made to put out this 5 alarm fire. Instead they're divided on if it's even real.\n\nI desperately want to hope that this is the first step in big changes to come to alleviate this issue. But the evidence suggests that at best we'll get some minor changes in a month or two that barely serve to mitigate the damage creep from the previous month or two alone and people at Riot will pat themselves on the back for a job well done and continue on making the game unplayably unfun.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ayzev","date":"2018-07-27T11:35:16.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cosnirak,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K0b5fhnN,comment-id=00100000,timestamp=2018-07-26T23:17:34.376+0000)\n>\n> they deserve to be mocked\n\nWhile I do get a giggle out of some of these comments, that's really all that mockery will accomplish.

It sends a message, and when they read the mockery they receive that message. It varies from post to post somewhat but the overriding point is that they aren't doing their job well enough in this regard. And if you read their own posts about stuff they get mocked for they generally seem to get and accept that and acknowledge it (eventually at least).\n\nCompare it to the devs for some games (or lots occasions outside gaming) where people being mocked for stuff like this often deflect and downplay and dismiss concerns. Riot may get there way too late, disagree on whether it's even the issue we say it is, ect., but they still acknowledge that _something_ happened and made players upset and they care. Ghostcrawler himself has many times said that anger from players doesn't generally bother him because he understands it stems from player passion.\n\nPersonally I hate the terrible misquote about not needing to play the game and other things along that vein, as well as stuff like personal threats and baseless character attacks. But legitly mocking their failures, especially egregious ones, is a valuable tool of the masses to express the depth of their pain.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2018-07-26T19:52:36.510+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**Progress has been made**_","replies":[]}]}
