In fact this is probably one of the furthest things you could get from war. \nLet's take chess for example. It is a highly competitive game, but at the start and finish of each match, the two players (I'm referring to high level play) shake hands and wish each other good luck, or congratulate them on their win.\nOr (American) Football. This is something that is a bit closer to a war like scenario, but even then, when the captains come forward for the coin toss, they shake hands honorably, and promise the refs a clean game, and after the game is done, they tell each other \"good game\"\nHell, even MMA fighters (closest thing you could get to a RL combat scenario)at the start of each match touch gloves to acknowledge to fight honorably and fair, enjoying the chance to participate in something they enjoy.
