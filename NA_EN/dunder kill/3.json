That W cast time meant that 90% of champs with any form of mobility (all if you count flash) could reposition maokai's end location at will, and while it had trade offs for both sides (usually wasted escape tools from the target, and unpredictable end location for Mao) it was a much healthier ability, even though it had significantly longer range and higher travel time. I'd rather they give it back the range and cast time, returning it's strategic strength ***AND*** its counterplay.\n\nEspecially now that they finally gave him the passive fix I've been pushing for for years (boost the heal but make it only work on Mao's abilities) and tuned his saplings to be extra strong jungle vision, if they were to buff the cast range in exchange for the cast speed, Maokai could finally return to the jungle where he belongs.","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-04-21T12:50:23.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He will be a jungler, his ultimate is just too good for ganking and his clears are insane.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2017-04-21T19:31:35.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult looked way too slow from what I've seen, it mostly looks like a zoning tool.
