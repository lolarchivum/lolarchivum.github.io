Thinking that Dynamic Queue could replace soloqueue was folly, and removing soloqueue was a mistake.\n\nTL;DR - I personally don't like soloqueue.  I never liked how it felt (though new champ select makes that way better), and I never liked how the games played out.  I thought it was Mario party.  An incredible number of people think otherwise and don't like Dynamic Queue.  I totally understand that.  Riot should do good by everyone and allow both schools of thought live at the same time.  Bring soloqueue back, and keep Dynamic Queue here as well.  Neither should exist at the expense of the other.  \n\nTo take it up a notch, a proposed solution would be to have an opt-out option in the client.  Allowing people to opt-out of being placed with a 4 man would be a great compromise to the whole situation.  4 man queue times would go up, but not nearly as much as if everyone who played solo and didn't care either way went to the dedicated soloqueue instead.  Furthermore, soloqueue players that opted out would only see longer queue times relative to the number of 4 man queues that their search passes up, allowing them to still match into 2q and 3q groups (which apparently aren't nearly as much of a problem to them?), and this also means 2q and 3q groups will not see any difference in queue time which would happen if all of the singletons spun off to soloqueue instead.\n\nSoloqueue fills a niche that doesn&#039;t gel with Dynamic Queue.  Yes, on paper, dynamic queue makes sense.  A solo + 4man vs a solo + 4man makes sense, right?  Except that what if their solo is Nasus top lane, and you queue solo jungler.  Now the enemy team&#039;s jungler is in close communication with two lanes, while Nasus does his Nasus thing and you&#039;re getting screamed at by everyone on your team.  This is not a zero sum equation.\n\nSoloqueue needs to come back (with New Champ Select of course), because tons of people want to play the game solo vs solos.  Riot can&#039;t hide behind the defense that this is a pure teamwork game because so many champions and items and strategies exist to encourage this as a viable strategy.  1+1+1+1+1 vs 1+1+1+1+1 is completely functional and these players should be allowed to pick this instead of being pressganged into a premade.\n\nTeambuilder also filled a niche that neither soloqueue nor New Machmaking pulls off.  The ability to just flat out ensure you get your role and your champ.  If you want to practice something specifically or you really just want to play something right now, you could find respite from the tumultuous hell that was pick/call soloqueue in here.  Furthermore, some people just don&#039;t want a damn rank hanging over them like the moon in Majora&#039;s Mask.  They just want to play Azir mid all the god damn time with no fuss.  That was the beauty that Teambuilder brought.  New Champ Select, IMO, does a well enough job, but Riot would do well to realize what Teambuilder brought to the table and why some people find New Champ Select  a flat out downgrade.\n\nHowever, Dynamic Queue needs to remain as it is to allow solo entities like myself whom greatly enjoy being able to link up with premades and try to merge with their teamwork for full teamwork oriented gameplay.  Teambuilder was just soloqueue with dedicated picks, and soloqueue never came close to what I wanted.  Dynamic Queue is my god damn ambrosia.  It is my Valhalla, where I can find warriors of legend and fight alongside them for glory.  No other queue method reliably combined the ability for me to reliably play what I wanted, in a ranked format, with the potential to play with teams that actually wanted to work together as a group.\n\nOn queue times, I love the quality of the matches Dynamic Queue brings me.  I&#039;d rather wait 30m for a good match, than two minutes for a 20m surrender shitshow on either side.\n\nStill, Riot should at least entertain the idea of bringing soloqueue back.  There are clearly three distinct types of players (idgaf I just wanna play what I want right now, solo rankers, and group rankers that don&#039;t want to be nailed down to a ranked team).  Servicing only one of them (at the expense of the other two!) is just unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"TallyZrg","date":"2016-04-28T19:45:13.363+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Take my upvote for a professional, polite, and well worded assessment of the current situation of the game.\n\nI do appreciate that you did not whine like 90% of the other posts on this topic.

I had a hundred percent guarantee to have a miserable time, even winning, in soloqueue.  I know that soloqueue is not for me, but it is for a lot of other people, and if they want to play that then I don't see any reason why they should be denied.  Hell, I believe it'd be win-win.  I'm sure matching a bunch of soloqueuers would be fast so none of them would have to worry about vicious queue times, and while it may increase DQ match times I know for sure that everyone involved would be completely teamwork focused because all of the wildcard solo entities would be in their own hopper.\n\nSo I mean, please, seriously, put Soloqueue back in.  Not because blah blah whiny blah blah, but because there are seriously two extremely divergent religions when it comes to playing, and killing one to raise up the other is not the way to go.\n\nThough, honestly, New Champ Select should have probably soaked into soloqueue for a while to see if it absolved a lot of problems without adding Dynamic Queue in, and, if there really must be a compromise, I would still sacrifice DQ for NCS-soloqueue if it meant making everyone more globally happy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-04-28T20:39:22.570+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"They will *never* have room for both DQ and Solo Queue.

Important distinction.\n\nI don't really see the need to bring Team Builder back, to be honest, and I'm a fan of having a standardized method of selecting your champion in all queues.  I agree that being guaranteed a specific role is nice, but I don't feel it's worth an entirely separate queue just to raise your chance of getting your primary from ~60% to 100% when that isn't at all applicable for any other queue (e.g. Ranked).\n\nIn my personal opinion, Dynamic Queue is ideal for normal games whereas Solo Queue is ideal for ranked games.  It's mathematically impossible for Dynamic Queue to result in games as balanced as pure Solo Queue, this is an inarguable fact, and for a queue toted as the most competitive in League of Legends this issue seems pretty significant.  I just don't really see where Team Builder would fit in there without pulling players away from Dynamic Queue in normal games, which is likely to further increase queue times for both Team Builder **and** Dynamic Queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Cirrusstrafe","date":"2016-04-28T20:34:30.555+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree.  This was mostly an attempt to discuss all of the prior models and what they did for the communities.  I'm gonna go and revise my message about DQ-NCS.\n\nWhile team builder did have its place, the only real sway it had was guaranteed champ and role (and sometimes insane queue times dwarfing DQ times).\n\nAs some below point out, even with LoL's gigantic playerbase the queue times would be absurd if fragmented into all these variants, so if I had to pick a subset I would want to retain Dynamic Queue + New Champ Select  for Ranked, as well as Solo Queue + New Champ Select for Ranked as an alternate.\n\nThat said, I think blind pick is kind of awkward when all is said and done and would have been fine if that got swapped out with Team Builder permanently but that would probably cause more harm than good.  Some people just want to click go and play as fast as possible with no fuss or pageantry.\n\nI do disagree with the idea that DQ is not the way to roll with ranked, but that's because I strongly believe the landscape of the game is dramatically different between a sea of solos/duos and a premade crew.  There was once a time I did play on a five man team in ranked teams, and I may as well have been playing two different games when I bounced between soloqueue ranked and team ranked.  The champs I found success on (and, if the same champs, even the way I played them), the difference in how I approached combat, hell even the lane setups I'd gank for when I ran jungle changed completely.  Most of those friends quit, and I vastly preferred the flow of the game in a five man premade.   I get a lot of that feel from DQ when I pair up with premades, though, and it combined with New Champ Select singlehandedly made me care again.\n\nDQ tries to strike a balance, and I like that.  I'm sure I'm not alone when it comes to people who cannot find four other reliable players despite constantly attempting to.\n\nTL;DR, and don't take offense to this soloqueue one man army players, but I don't want to play like that and I don't want to play alongside you guys if you are unhappy with the premade thing.  I don't want you to be unhappy either but ya'll play a much different feeling game, IMO, than I want to, so hopefully they give you soloqueue back to be able to play it again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DustyElLion","date":"2016-04-29T05:23:34.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replace blind pick.

The game felt like Mario Party to me, in there.  With screwball \"coordination\" and five team leaders the only real big strategies that seemed to go down were simply by virtue that when at pure chaos one can only move towards more order.  My efforts always felt muted and often voided by the randomness of all the shit going on in the map at completely random times unless I hardcarried with 20 kills in as many minutes.  To me, soloqueue felt like \"things happened, a team won, and I was there.\"  Winning never felt good to me in soloqueue, it was merely a relief that we didn't lose.  It felt like the random unassociated shit that my team did just happened to work better at the time than the random unassociated shit that the other team did.\n\nWith DQ, I can at least reliably get the sense that people are coordinating in a team, and I enjoy linking up with that like some half baked Voltron, and that at the very least there's the illusion that everyone is moving towards things with a purpose, as a team.\n\nI know many feel very, very, differently and prefer that environment and, by all means, Riot should listen and you should have it, but neither soloqueue nor dynamic queue should exist at the cost of the other, because some people want one, some people want the other, and neither group should force the other group to play their version of League.\n\nAlso, a small jab here and I do apologize in advance but \"Where as dynamic ranked degraded the solo player experience to the point where the game is decided by which side has the better more organized premade.\"  I mean, I'm going to try to be as inoffensive as possible, but you are literally complaining that a team based game is being decided by the best team.  I know it feels awkward to consider, but if you help that premade out and link up, then for that game, you are their single serving addition to \"their\" team.  A good premade with a garbage player that feeds left and right is going to lose to a decent premade if the missing Planeteer links up.  You can carry just as hard with a premade team filling the rest of your ranks as you could with four other solos.  The only way that is taken away from you is if you put that on yourself.  There's no difference between a solo 24-0 Ahri in last year's soloqueue and a solo 24-0 Ahri in this year's dynamic queue.\n\nI see the same argument all over the place, and ya'll are totally allowed to want soloqueue back and I think Riot should do it, but I want everyone to realize the hilarity of this argument (and realize that I have almost exclusively soloqueued into DQ this year):\n\nSoloqueue players since launch: \"I hate losing because the enemy team's randoms were better than my team's randoms.\"\nSoloqueuers in Dynamic Queue: \"I hate losing because the enemy team's premade was better than my team's.\"\n\nBut in terms of winning, many of you feel cheated because your contributions were somehow undercut by the mere fact that the other people are in a Skype call?  I truly don't understand why.  You helped shape that game as a win.  You showed that you were a fifth wheel that could be relied on or at least trusted to not do terribly.  You can even carry the whole thing!

Now solos can magnify their impact by feeding into the strategy the other four are employing.\n\nI think a lot of the pain on the tip of everyone's tongues that nobody wants to just come out and say is that lots of solo players simply don't want to feel required to \"play as a team.\"  In a 1+4 environment then it is very unlikely that the situation that they can win now by ignoring or playing around (read: not intentionally with) the 4-Q because the 4-Q is extremely unlikely to shift to play ball with whatever the solo was doing.\n\nIt makes sense, in a strange way.  Solos in soloqueue were almost definitely more successful doing their own thing because if everyone was then there's equal probability that other solos will link up randomly and help your thing succeed and vice versa, and there's less a chance that the enemy rallies up and stonewalls you in a coordinated effort.\n\nI think that if everyone just chills out and stops treating it like 1+4 (which I know I am bad and perpetuating by saying it like that a lot) and just taking it as \"the rest of my team is coordinated\" then a lot more people will have a much better time, but if someone doesn't want that pressure and almost required team play focus then they should be allowed to play something (soloqueue redux) that alleviates all those concerns.

Solo players simply don't want to coordinate with premade strangers in their own teams because they prefer solitude. I understand because they are humans after all. Not all humans are sociable, but this is a team game where they are often required to communicate strategies and encourage your teammates, which makes the whole situation ironic and paradoxical.\n\nThe other issue is toxicity, but this can be properly explained. Unsuccessful solo players often remember and speak of the times when they were berated, ignored, flamed by the premades. However, it's common sense that people only remember bad experiences in League of Legends rather than bland \"good experiences\". Also, toxicity was often found in Solo Queue too, so it's not just exclusive to Dynamic Queue, but the same vocal crowd seems to have selective memory.\n\nDon't get me wrong: there definitely are existing issues in Dynamic Queue (like teams composed of 5 solo players getting matched against teams with premades, or weak players potentially getting carried by their high-elo premade partners), but like I said in [this post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/xynP3nE2-so-many-solo-queue-threads?comment=000300000000000000000000), measuring individual performances in a team game simply does not work unless Riot sets up legitimate, valid and adequate criteria for it, which Riot said they won't do.

I'll leave).\n\nTo me, more often than not back in soloqueue it was less of a desire to fill the group out because they wanted to, but because they probably didn't get to do what they wanted or were best at and just wanted to hedge the bet by playing into meta.  Support getting forced into mid lane somehow?  Well, I'm not sure what I'm doing here so lemme just consult a counterpick site and just take a hardcounter and pray.  They did whatever it took to win, because playing what they wanted to and having fun was already off the table.  This is also why, I believe, people got so mad at losing.  Far more often than not people were strongarmed into crap they didn't want to play, so all they really had was the big W.  Take that away and...  \n\nIn my eyes, in NCS, people are extremely excited that they can grab what they want, in the role they want, so it ends up going from \"ugh I got stuck on top lane and we need a tank right now so I guess I'll pick one or whatever\" to \"holy crap I got a jungler and Nidalee wasn't banned awwww yes!\"  Of course, that's just me.  I have way more fun losing a game by playing something I like in a way I like it than losing a game (and sometimes winning them!) after being held hostage by pick order and meta.  I truly think that (when the clearly OP are banned) a team of five people playing stuff they love and are experienced with are much more likely to win (or at least enjoy themselves no matter what) than they would be in soloqueue left to rot under a role they despise, and I think that NCS offers that in spades.\n\nTo me, arguing that the old system was \"better\" is sort of like saying it was better that people were constantly playing stuff they didn't want to because it matched with the meta and was more likely to win than it was to have everyone do what they wanted to do and enjoy doing it.\n\nNow, for the rest of the argument with regards to soloqueue and whatnot, many seem to feel that even that doesn't offset the pain they feel at playing in DQ ranked, which is why I am totally for putting soloqueue back in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"50ShadesOfGender","date":"2016-04-28T18:49:13.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cirrusstrafe","date":"2016-04-28T20:48:23.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd much rather wait 15m for a good match where everyone is playing what they want and the teams are evened out than a potpourri match where everyone may as well have been picked first come first serve.\n\nFifteen minutes of waiting?

TrueSkill on the Xbox, the list can go on forever.  The only actual way to evaluate a ranking is to consider the team as a whole unit (e.g. full team ranked) and evaluate as such.  Anything else is a farce.  \n\nIn fact, dynamic queue ELO is the closest thing they're gonna get to team-based-single-player ELO.  Why?  Because it's now evaluating a person's ability to play with a team against a team, instead of evaluating five single entities playing against five single entities but they are also sort of working together towards a common goal or whatever, so whomever ends up being the more generally reliable wins and moves ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrLlamaWaffle","date":"2016-04-29T03:57:06.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Team Builder was the greatest thing that ever happened to this game no idea why they removed it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"option paralysis","date":"2016-04-28T20:37:39.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk man, starting 2 years ago playing ranked I thought I'd play this for a long long time.

You have all 5 roles \"covered\". However in reality you need a solo player that picked adc and support. That solo player can find a group of any combination that needs either adc or support which is a much larger number. On top of that matchmaking will specifically try to find another premade of 4. A team of 5 has to find another team of 5 which their are the lowest amount of. On the other hand a premade of 2 can find another premade of 2 and a solo player or a premade of 3 or 3 solo players.
