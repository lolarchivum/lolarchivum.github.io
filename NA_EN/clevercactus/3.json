In fact, that's usually closer to the norm.  My father is a nam vet, trust me... I know.\n\nBut this is a larger than life bit of fiction, and I feel the understated take they took on it was a bad one.  In a game full of larger than life heroes, plots and magic, she's the lackluster one BECAUSE she's acting so normal and nonplussed.  She reminds me of a real person... but she's not.  She is a magical-warrior wearing a skinned bug monster that fights OTHER bug monsters using her boss superpowers!  If they were doing a thing like Zac, where she's a laid-back normal person despite seeming like she SHOULD be some kind of skittering monster or lunatic, that would be fine... but that characterization works for Zac because he is a giant blob.  He's NOT human, and so him acting normal is enough of a contrast that it's charming and gives him a solid character.  She's not inhuman enough for that to work for her, and she's not intense enough, or  emotionally dead enough, to make it seem like her ordeal even HAPPENED.  She's got a catsuit with goofy wings and beyond that, her trip to the void may as well have been a day spent in detention for how much it's affected her.  \n\nIf they want her to be the girl who went through the worst ordeal one can imagine and came out of it an upbeat, determined optimist, that's a GREAT character... but they didn't sell that either!  She's so dispassionate with her lines that she really doesn't even seem that upbeat either.\n\nI really think the problem is just the VO.  Either they directed the voice actress to undersell the shit out of her lines, or the voice actress chose to do that on her own... but she needed more of a character to come across, and it wouldn't have taken much to do that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2018-02-22T15:57:52.168+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":4,"body":"While I'm not setting my judgement in stone until the lore comes out I guess, as of now I generally agree with you wholeheartedly.\n\nEven ignoring the champion's back drive device of simply \"Out to stop void monsters!\", she just doesn't look very void-y herself.\nWatching the special interactions video, the ones where she has some when attacking Kassadin, I was just looking at the two and Kass looks 5 times more like a Void monstrosity than Kai'sa does.\n\nLong story short, Riot is afraid of monster girls to be honest.\nIt's why all of Evelynn's skins turn her human now; she isn't blue in a single one of her skins since the rework.\nRiot is striving more and more away from non-humanoid designs and it's so boring and so bland that it makes the game overall start to feel boring.\n\nStop giving me two legged, standing, humanoid characters and go back to making champions with designs more like Cho'Gath or Rek'Sai or something.\nI'm so sick and tired of League just pumping out more generic characters with cliche lore's that literally took about an hour at most of thought.\nSome of the old lore may have been bad, but at least it was unique; I liked Nasus being a Space Librarian, thank you very much!","replies":[{"poster":"Corrupt Bliss","date":"2018-02-23T01:36:17.356+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"And to add to it, Kassadin has this sick breathing sounds when you play him.

She can be a pretty normal person who is just overjoyed to be home and see the real world again.\n\nBut she's not any of these things.  The most intense experience that I can imagine happening to ANYONE in the league setting happened to her, and she sells it like it was an unpleasant afternoon stuck in traffic.

I want her to be a CHARACTER.  To show that her ordeal had an impact on her somehow.  Her current VO makes it seem like it really wasn't so big a deal at all.

She can overcome it, be changed and dehumanized by it or be utterly broken by it... but to have the whole thing amount to nothing but a very human-looking super suit and a few half-hearted lines about how the void sucks and is stupid DOES diminish the whole freaking thing and every character connected to it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jobless Jones","date":"2018-02-23T03:17:30.707+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"She's a generic waifu champ made to extract money from horny teens and weebs, but they couldn't {{champion:84}} justify {{champion:103}} making {{champion:43}}  another {{champion:39}} Ionian {{champion:16}} one{{champion:134}}  again {{champion:498}} so they're decided this one will have void sprinkles on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2018-02-22T18:09:19.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kai'Sa makes the Void seem sexy.","replies":[{"poster":"Jack Garrus","date":"2018-02-23T15:52:00.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leaf on Bush,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0YGTYEoj,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2018-02-22T18:09:19.383+0000)\n>\n> Kai&#x27;Sa makes the Void seem sexy.\n\nNo. {{champion:421}} does","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fƒ15","date":"2018-02-23T03:40:10.460+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the voice acting is kind of boring too, definitely agree that this is wasted potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-02-22T20:10:45.214+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"#You are forgetting the fact that she's in a symbiotic relationship with its Voidspawn inhabitant, which is her suit that's like her second skin.\n\nIf anything, it is the reason why she was protected from becoming a monstrosity like the rest of the Voidspawn.

When we think of the void, we think of exactly that, a \"half mutated, fluctuating between wanting to stop the invasion or wanting to devour living creatures.\" Every champion that has a void related story is somewhat evil, corrupted, and seeks destruction. This is a change, a pretty cool change. A character who has been trapped in this dimension of evil creatures with different abilities, not knowing if she will ever escape, or when her last day will be. It's exhilarating to say the least. I get the complaints, truly, it discredits what the void should be capable of, but to assume that the void will inevitably corrupt anyone that gets trapped will get dull later, if not sooner. Truthfully, there's so much they can play off of this, like another void champion that joins the league seeking revenge on Ka'sai. I hope this post changes a few minds who are upset or disappointed with what we know of the lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pidgeot72","date":"2018-02-22T21:24:17.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK_jhdXINFk Recently released, good video, brings up a lot of good points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2018-02-22T17:33:36.064+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with this.
