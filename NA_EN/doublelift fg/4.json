Taric should have one of the best lane dominance. You nerfed it because let's be honest if you were stuned you was dead.\nBut then, instead of reducing its power you just completly removed it.  He doesn't have poke, He doesn't have sustain because stop saying that taric's heal is a thing, costs 80 / 95 / 110 / 125 / 140 Mana? for a 18 sec cd heal which you aren't maxing first.\n\nSo if you have taric in lane, you are forced to fight else you will lose lane. Eventually you will face a ranged champion stun him for 1.2 sec and can't even have the time to reach him and shred his armor. You will get kited and will never be able to use your passive effectively. If you don't , you will be screwed because he has hilarous cooldown.\n\nRiot is fighting hidden power, what the heck is his W and his ulti? 12% bonus armor aura and 15/25/35 bonus AD/AP to his team you can't even see the power it gives.\nterrible design, really terrible\n\nEDIT: FINALLY MANA COST REDUCED","replies":[{"poster":"KidSpectre","date":"2015-03-05T16:42:31.221+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can still 1v2 people under my tower and walk away with a double.
