Turns out, the enemy support primarily plays Blitzcrank. (has not played Soraka yet in season 6 and has a <50%wr with her in season 5). It also came to my attention that people can't dodge skillshots, but that's a different story...\n\nI *guess* I can sorta understand (not really) if it's a fairly strong pick and you're not that high in the pick order, but it's still annoying as heck. It also sucks knowing that if U do good w/ certain champs, it's gonna make 9 other people more inclined to ban him/her in their next game.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2016-02-17T15:21:38.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It also sucks knowing that if U do good w/ certain champs, it's gonna make 9 other people more inclined to ban him/her in their next game.\n\nI don't think so. If I get obliterated by a god tier Tryndamere I won't ban him next game, because it's probably losing my ban: there is a very little chance you will get matched against another god tier Tryndamere again. Yes, it sucks the time when it happens, but those 99 times it didn't, you realize it'd be a waste of a ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-02-17T04:56:33.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Depression420,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2w4L7epo,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-02-17T01:58:34.181+0000)\n>\n> what comes to mind when I notice ppl trying to make decisions for others https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sBYxUj18sA\n\nhhhhmmmmMMMMMmMMMMMmMmMMmMMMMMMM","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dragonface","date":"2016-02-16T22:58:41.776+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even worse when you DO use pick intent and someone bans your pick.\n\nThanks random stranger for banning Soraka when I was first pick.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2016-02-17T00:15:09.324+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dragonface,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2w4L7epo,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-16T22:58:41.776+0000)\n>\n> It's even worse when you DO use pick intent and someone bans your pick.\n> \n> Thanks random stranger for banning Soraka when I was first pick.\n\nSometimes I ban their pick when they use pick intent to show that they want to pick {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} and when I note that the team is going to be a full AD team with assassins and no AP/tanks then I ban one of those champions so that they can't fuck my team composition.","replies":[{"poster":"Sypher The Poro","date":"2016-02-17T01:44:12.642+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"As a Riven main with almost 250K mastery points now, I hate people like you.
