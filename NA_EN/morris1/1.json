I really only find Yasuo to be my strong champion right now. I used to main master Y and Jax, but since they removed sated devourer, it's not really as good to tryhard as them anymore. I really don't want Yasuo gutted, only light nerfs to his shield and maybe his windwall cd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-08-09T20:00:39.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about vision abilities?
