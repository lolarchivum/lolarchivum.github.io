(And of course at some point, being silver 3 -2100 LP is going to be problematic to fix even with a diamond 3 mmr getting 50+ LP per win.)\n\nJust requiring no blatent trolls is a much softer requirement that results in way more games played and fewer dodges.\n\nMaybe a middle ground of no trolls+no autofills, or no trolls+everyones winrate on their chosen champ is at least X for some X>50, or some other criteria, but it's not clear what the optimal strategy is.\n\nIn practice just playing everything works fine for climbing (provided you are below where you belong), and is probably most fun provided you're not prone to tilt, but it's interesting to think about theoretically.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-02-06T21:55:37.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I gotta try that!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Paíntchip","date":"2018-02-06T09:43:48.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well silver would be a dream.
