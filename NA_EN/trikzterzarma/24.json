What about you? Did you rush {{item:3191}} yet? Because that item literally cucks Zed especially early game. {{item:2420}} cucks Zed even more. If you had at least 1 of these items, then please mention it in your post since it is important, if you didnt then its your fault. Actually... {{item:1029}} alone is enough.\n\n\nZed's ultimate pops off based on the damage he deals to you before it pops. He AA'd you 2 times and ignited you, then the pop repeats that damage. \n\nAssassins have a lot of damage, Zed is one of them. You were playing Morgana who is supposed to be VERY squishy and a food for assassins.\n\nYou had so much counter. You said that he R you and misses **ALL** of his spells, good. Next, He AA'd you 2 times. This could've been prevented when you Q him. You could've taken minimal, or no damage assuming that Zed didnt AA you immediately after ulting and not stupid enough to waste his ignite on you. You could've cucked him more using your W. If you also didnt use your E yet, then you should've used it to minimize damage. \n\nIt was also possible that Electrocute proc'd on you. Also cant forget the \"_Sudden Impact_\" rune\n\n\"**_But my Q was on cooldown_**\"\nThen its fair. **Zed looked for an opportunity**. He punished you. \n\n\"**_But I didnt have enough mana_**\"\nYou were playing a squishy, immobile mage and had low mana and you were playing against an assassin. You should've recalled unless your jungle was going to gank, then staying in lane while having low mana is basically a suicide.\n\n\"**_My Q missed_**\"\nSkillshots favor skill.\n\n\"**_The damage and lethality from the dirk is at fault_**\"\nZed (or assasins in general) is pretty weak before he gets {{item:3147}} and other bullshit lethality items like {{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3036}}. A {{item:3134}} wont win against {{item:1029}} or especially {{item:3191}} . I think right now its a mess. Riot should do something about lethality and armor pen to make most of the players happy while also make assassin mains satisfied. Oh wait, that's probably not possible.\n \n\nAlso, I dont know why he would ignite unless he was sure to get a kill. You just wasted his ignite. Well done. You also survived. I dont recommend playing Morgana mid next time against Zed if you dont know how to deal with him. Maybe use Fizz instead.\n\nI think I'm going to get lots of downvotes since boards mainly favors mages and tanks over assassins.  Anything that deals more damage than the champion they are playing is apparently \"unbalanced\" but please... I was just trying to help you\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bμbble Butt","date":"2018-09-27T17:02:13.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a problem with it don't buy skins.\n\nMoney speaks louder than words.
