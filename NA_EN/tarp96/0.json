I max up q and w until 6, then put a point in ultimate then finally at 7, I will put one in E. However sometimes it's good to put it in at level 5, especially if you have an early game jungler.

It's not neccesary if you got already got some kills, one dash and e is enought for your target to not be able to escape from you, until you shut them down. I played have played with diana about 50 games with/against platinum-master sometimes challenger players. And I did very well in those games, looking at my knowledge about this champion ( as you see he requirs a lot less of it).\n3. I didn't played her in lane, becouse I'm not so skilled, but I in the jungle I'm the queen with her, after reaching level 6. I can do full clear by losing only minimum amount of hp. You can't do much pre 6, but you can't get invaded and killed in your jungle in most cases, becouse of the tankiness she has.\n4. No, theres always a smart choise to put a poin on e in case you get ganked in lane or spoted in your own jungle by multiple enemies, it helps a little bit. Most of the champions who has no escapes has the same tankiness, but not both - such a power\n\nAs she ment to be a bruiser, theres no point buildin her like this in most cases, she does benefict team more with being a glass cannon who deals insane amount of demage.\n\n6. I never builded attack speed on diana, I always went go for max and fast burst, to kill my enemies as fast as possible. For me, attack speed diana is weaker, in case I needed it, I was building nashoor tooth as my 3-5 nd item, most of the time 5 nd.\n\n8. Shooting q is insanely easy, I didn't even fed in my first games, I actualy did very well, but maybe becouse she fits my play style, I don't know.\n\n9. I agree, her snowballing is insane and hard to shut down.\n\n10. I agree with that, I just feel bad, becouse everytime I play her I'm doing very well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Andrionar","date":"2015-11-16T21:13:07.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"I hate diana with a passion, I used to play her.

Her shield is used to deal more demage most of the time and sometimes depending on the situation you can use it as a defensive tool, that slow is more then enought, comparing with the demage she has and comparing how snowbally she will became after a few kills.

If she does get ahead, it's by a few kills and then you can just CC and shut her down. And playing normals against high elo players is different because plat+ is a different gameplay style than silver. In silver, you have to snowball to carry, in upper elos you have to have stronger decision making and coordination with your team, like positioning and mechanics. I think you're really assuming too much of Diana based on your own play in silver. I mean, I'm sure Akali averages like 20+ kills in Bronze, does that make her OP across all tiers?

She wasn't never meant to be a tank or they would of gave her armor and magic resist buffs like {{champion:102}} {{champion:24}}. She was SUPPOSE to be a AP Fighter, so that's why she has a shield in the first place. As for her doing more damage than your standard AD Fighters {{champion:62}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:58}}, well she basically has to. They all have sustain in a fight from their life steal items, meanwhile {{champion:131}} does not. Being a AP Fighter, AP items make her a little more bursty but at a cost of any sort of sustain. Not taking CC against {{champion:131}} is like not taking CC against {{champion:55}}, it doesn't mean the champion is OP, it just means you have no idea how to play the game. As for \"I'm Silver and I get matched with plat+ in normals\". Well reality check, SO DOES EVERYONE. When I was in Silver like a year ago I was paired against diamond / master tier players in the odd game. That doesn't mean I'm on their level, it means that someone else around or in that tier is on my team and there is also a silver player on the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Andrionar","date":"2015-11-17T22:18:53.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a rondom shet, I didn't said that she meant to a tank, I said that she meant to be a tank bruiser/an ap bruiser, (fighter), wich means some demage items and the left ones should be tank items.\n\nNo, man, a year ago I was paired with other bronze-silver players in my normal games.

O.o\n\nIm matched with gold- platinum, 1-2 diamond players right now usualy, becouse I started to play with master yi recently, and lost like 20 games out of 30, maybe even more and that one who was unranked, could be playing with hes premades and thats why he had higher mmr and played with us. If you still don't believe me, wait till i start playing champions wich I usually play and u'll see?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Azır","date":"2015-11-17T23:51:39.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Andrionar,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=opuHZI8W,comment-id=000700000001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-17T23:50:09.538+0000)\n>\n> Oh, if you have it doesn't mean that you are silver, you could have frames from the season before.

Exactly as I said.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Azır","date":"2015-11-18T00:01:52.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Andrionar,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=opuHZI8W,comment-id=00070000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-17T23:55:47.287+0000)\n>\n> I'm not lieing, for about 5 months I was playing with platinum-master divisions.

I Max w first so when i know I'm going to get hit I pop my sheild walk up and kill my minions then walk away and use the range from my q to kill the rest. Until my sheild is up again. I rarely miss minions too. If they get to close I use my e and melee them 3 times to show them who's boss then at 6 they die lol. Maxing my sheild does leas damage but I can walk away from a trade with full health.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
