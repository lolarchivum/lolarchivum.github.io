People also want light and heavy fighters to be able to contribute to full-blown teamfights and threaten adcs, which means they can't do too much damage to targets of a medium level of durability - otherwise they just shred bruisers. \n\nSo...that leaves tanks. If adcs can't burst, and can't shred bruisers, that leaves tanks. It's one thing if you're saying \"Adcs are taking tanks out just a bit too quickly given their relative durability, their tankbusting should be hit a little but they can still keep a decent amount of power there\", but if you don't want them to kill tanks....what are they supposed to do in a teamfight? Die? Run away screaming? If they're nothing but a potential liability in teamfights, they might as well opt out, going to hide in base until their team wins a fight and then peeking out to right-click objectives.
