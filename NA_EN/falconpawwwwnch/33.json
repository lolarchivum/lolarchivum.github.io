You're forgetting that every adc has SOME small cooldown on mobility.  They also have mana costs (Not huge but still). Kalista's E stacking is horrid too; at level 1 she can really out-trade any other adc; and the best part is, is that she's the most mobile adc with some of the better CC/survivabilty. \n\n\nAlso the champions you listed have a (slow/snare/point to click CC) Try landing a leona ulti dead on when she's jumping around. Or try landing a rengar bola strike when she's jumping around.

Vaynes tumble is better than kalista's \"hop\" in range.\n\nAlso, warwick does not have a slow, just used his blood scent ability.  Even if I listed other champs though there were plenty of other people in game who had no trouble with her either.  Almost every melee champ has a gap closer.  She got shredded by our yi during one game.\n\nStrange as well that you go for rengar bolas strike as an example, as you have two gap closing options on him that only require bushes and his ulti gives him full energy for a stun bolas at point blank range which makes all this chasing discussion pretty irrelevant.\n\nIf you don't believe me go play against her in game.
