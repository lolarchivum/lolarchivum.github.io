It would likely be easier for them to remove it and then be able to balance her like every other champion, getting predictable changes from increases to her health regeneration, defenses, or damage.  Currently the smallest of changes can sometimes create unusually dramatic changes in her performance, as evidenced by the recent change in how auto attacks are registered.\n\nIn short, Riven needs to have animation cancelling on skills removed then it wouldn't matter about auto attack animation cancelling as much.","replies":[{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2016-10-07T18:13:54.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðelofasht,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xf7hWgHc,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-07T13:39:27.217+0000)\n>\n> The issue is that she can cancel both auto animations AND skills I think, and as you pointed out keeps her balance in a precarious state.

Thus my point, as long as she remains able to cancel animations for skills she will remain difficult to balance.  She would greatly benefit from allowing her to queue up the skills but finish the animations for one skill before starting another, and then rebalance her survivability and damage around that, maybe giving her a cooldown refund if she is interrupted in a combo for whatever skill was next up.

Logic. As for this \"buff\". All this does is make Riven available to more people. I don't think it buffs her as a champion. It just makes her animation cancelling available to more people who are not as good at it. It does the same thing to any other champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2016-10-07T23:50:01.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðelofasht,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xf7hWgHc,comment-id=000800000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-10-07T19:42:15.640+0000)\n>\n> Indeed she has and has always been harder to balance because of an interaction that few other champions can do, and none as frequently.
