The game now cater to trolls and feeders so much that it's just discouraging to play ranked anymore. They don't get banned while people who say things like \"you're shit\" get a ban. I don't know how that make sense when you can easily mute a person trash talking if you can't handle it but you can't stop someone from playing shit and troll and feeds every single game. And this is becoming more and more common every game. Trolls and feeders doesn't appear in every once in a while, it's in every single ranked game possible and they still are not banned.
