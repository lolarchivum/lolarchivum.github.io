Using a percentage method of refund would make it highly inefficient to abuse as you'd only be receiving a fraction of what they actual skins cost you, but in some peoples case that could be a few hundred dollars. All I'm saying is for those who have unfortunately been banned, some sort of good faith refund after spending hundreds to thousands of dollars could be warranted, in some peoples eyes. When you move out of your apartment you get your security deposit back, if you want to make that analogy. its not the 12000k you've paid in rent over the last 12 months, but it's something given back in good faith.","replies":[{"poster":"Erdrik","date":"2016-04-09T16:33:10.265+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CheesyJuices,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tPB6EZNE,comment-id=000a0000000000010000,timestamp=2016-04-09T16:23:17.800+0000)\n>\n> ...

In this case the banned player has already destroyed their \"good faith\" by ignoring the 3 other warnings _**that you have to get through to get to perma**_. (or by spewing hate speech)\n\nBesides even in that situation, the banned player has still spent time playing with the skin and therefore has already consumed  the intended \"product\".\n\nThe only way I can see an exception to this is if they were banned literally moments after a skin purchase. In which case _**only**_ that skin purchase should be refunded.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-04-09T15:57:20.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"besides, this could need up being abusable. \n\nI mean, if the refunded when they banned you people would probably get themselves banned and make new accounts because they bought a skin they didn't like.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheVishual","date":"2016-04-09T18:07:55.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tPB6EZNE,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2016-04-09T14:16:57.748+0000)\n>\n> it's actually exactly the same.\n> \n> there is a rule in place that you agree to. most apartments don't want people breaking the law, and specifically say that. riot has a code of conduct, and specifically tells you every patch.\n> \n> you broke the rule, and the punishment is throwing you out and then not letting you back in.\n> \n> clearly, the punishment is not meant to be a good thing for you, and it's likely they no longer have the money to pay you.\n> \n> so the answer? either stop being a git real god damn fast, or take your kick to the balls and leave because no one likes you.\n\nGetting kicked out of your apartment because you broke the law and getting banned and losing 200 bucks because of a chat restrict is pretty different, but like I said whatever helps you sleep at night","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-04-09T18:21:33.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no no, you just don't grasp the concept.\n\nremove all of your previous thoughts on apartments and league, and use it as a figure\n\nno you have a figure, an abstract thing that could be anything.\n\nthe next part is to introduce an amount of money, a piece that is intrinsically part of this. when you put money in, it becomes part of the figure.\n\nnext, you add a rule that explains what you can not do while associated with the figure, with the punishment being that the figure gets removed.\n\nfinally, you break the rule, and the figure gets taken away. the money has become part of the figure now, so it also gets taken away.\n\ntrying to take back the money is in a way asking for part of the figure to be returned to you, but as has been explained, this is not what has been agreed upon in accordance to the rule.\n\nthis is a somewhat complex but easy-ish way to see the logic of the comparison. something that your brain should put together in half a second, but yours has not due to prior experience and attachments that are irrelevant.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DontBanMeImDrunk","date":"2016-04-09T19:29:19.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"I think riot does a pretty poor job of banning people when they do nothing wrong other than use offensive language.

They give you 1 or 2 warnings before they perma-ban you for treating other players like trash.  If you choose to ignore those because you have trauma in your life (ie your Dad died, your mother has cancer, you're struggling with addiction, or your girlfriend cheated on you) it still doesn't mean everyone else should be **_forced to play with you_** until you feel reformed.  Using trauma as an **_excuse_** to keep treating others like trash is a joke and nobody should have to wait for what you think is \"the proper time to reform.\"  Either you take Riot's warnings seriously or you get to make a new account and start over.\n\nIt's like that in the work force.  If you have serious trauma in your life and you start to treat your co-workers like trash, your boss will bring you in his office.  ~~He'll offer~~ He should offer you counseling and a warning to leave your personal life at home. Your boss gets it that you might not realize how you're treating others.  So you're off with a warning at this point.  However, nobody at your work place should be treated like trash and deal with it until you feel deemed \"reformed.\"  Eventually your boss will bring you in his office and wish you luck in your next job.  He doesn't want to say that. No boss does. They know what you're going through. But he has to send you off because everyone else doesn't have to suffer because of you.  \n\nTL/DR: Nobody here in League should have to suffer because your are experiencing trauma in life.  If you get a warning, take it and leave your anger at home.","replies":[]}]}
