Aside from Tanks and Juggernauts, it actually seems almost rare for Riot to release melee champs that actually use mana normally these days. \n\nFiora is supposed to be spamming her Q as long as she is hitting things with it, it's supposed to be gated by cooldown (a really long one if she uses it to run away) rather than mana cost. The intent seems to be to let Fiora jump in to proc vitals and run away as her only means of poke (which still requires her to get in melee range) but restrict her E with mana to limit her ability to fully trade and all-in opponents. I think an early hit to her E's mana cost could work nicely to ease up Fiora's lane pressure without crippling her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-06-08T00:21:45.938+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":45,"body":"How to fix Fiora -\n\nDo nothing because shes fine.\n\nHow about you stop complaining about a champion that needs to be built squishy to be successful and actually requires skill?","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2017-06-08T00:31:54.915+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fuffychan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n2URiW04,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-08T00:21:45.938+0000)\n>\n> How to fix Fiora -\n> \n> Do nothing because shes fine.\n> \n> How about you stop complaining about a champion that needs to be built squishy to be successful and actually requires skill?\n\nl\nm\na\no","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Katarìna","date":"2017-06-08T18:52:17.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.imgflip.com/1qjrfd.jpg\nAlthough I do think they need to remove the attack speed slow","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warhammer Titan","date":"2017-06-08T00:35:40.087+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"I dont think shes fine, late game she can litteraly kill anyone under tower and they have to 2v1 her to stop the splitpush","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-06-08T00:59:37.523+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grand ChalIenge,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n2URiW04,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-06-08T00:35:40.087+0000)\n>\n> I dont think shes fine, late game she can litteraly kill anyone under tower and they have to 2v1 her to stop the splitpush\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nIf Fiora is alone you are doing something wrong.\n\nBring your entire fucking team top lane, then push it.\n\nEither their team comes and you 5v5, and Fiora is nearly useless in a full blown teamfight due to her low range and inability to reach the back line.\n\nOr they go somewhere else and you outpush them because 5>4.\n\n\nAlso she can't kill most skirmishers under tower, and a few divers.","replies":[{"poster":"Warhammer Titan","date":"2017-06-08T01:00:37.778+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"She can go bot, you bring your whole team its a free baron?","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-06-08T01:18:43.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grand ChalIenge,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n2URiW04,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2017-06-08T01:00:37.778+0000)\n>\n> She can go bot, you bring your whole team its a free baron?\n\nSend one to push, take Elder, and defend.

It would just make her have to recall or steal blue buff more in order to have the same impact. \n\nI do agree the attack speed slow on W sucks to play against. But I'm not sure about removing it completely without compensating Fiora in some way. It is a very strong aspect of her kit and W has an extremely long cool down to begin with. Removing it completely I think would make her far to weak in 1v1 situations where she should be strongest.\n\nFiora actually has massive windows of weakness that are very easy to take advantage of if you realize how long her cool downs are. Specifically in the  lane phase. Her cool downs at level 3 when she has all of her spells are 16 seconds on Q, 24 seconds on W, 13 seconds on E.

Fiora does not bully anyone early besides fucking Sion. Even Nasus stands a chance if she tries to all in her. So does Gangplank.\n\nJax's early trading is not that bad, he's melee yes, but so are most laners, and you can really only abuse his being melee if you manage to get ahead in the first place, and unless you're playing Darius, that's a skill thing. Not to mention most top laners rely on auto attacks for a large portion of their damage, so Jax's E gives him a very good chance of dueling people early game.\n\nThe problem with your argument is that Fiora doesn't bully anybody early game except Sion, but every single skirmisher in the game bullies Sion, and her lategame does well in a 1v1 yes, but it's still utter trash in teamfights.\n \n> Gangplank was nerfed hard because he bullied early and scaled well. Galio was nerfed for doing the same (and is going to get nerfed again.)\n\nThen how come it's completely possible to beat Fiora with Gangplank?\n\n> Fiora is pick/ban in competitive play for a fucking reason. She&#x27;s busted. You and your galore of silver buddies can parade on the boards all you want, she&#x27;s a balance monstrosity right now and should be permabanned until nerfed.\n\nShe's really not. 51% winrate.

Its the only actuall thing that helps her to kill ADC's in 1vs1 or 1vs2 ... and not to mention as slow is usseles against AP... AND that slow is for making plays... (i had soo many good ones with a help of it... soo many times saved my life) yoy can remove E slow if u want... And after all first E hit us kinda usseles... \n\nAND YES... Fiora needs skill to play... Most people dont understand because they think loosing to a champs means they are easy(this works not only for Fiora)... but when you try for first 10 games you are like \"Wtf how can i not win\" and then you just quit the champ because you are too lazy to learn it or you hate the playstyle and go back to playing Yasuo and QQ when get stomped by an \"easy\" champ. \n\nAnd all good fiora players you met are rank 4-7 mostly with her...  Soo they  have spent a lot of hours in her (like me almost 1 mil points) and know how she works... Me for example in Plat 2-3... playing as Fiora is super frustfrating and not \"easy\" (for one moment i even quit to support) and can get stomped by tanks if they know what they are doing...\n\nSo yeah removing Fiora W would be a huuuge strike to her when she is vs ad's And when you are vs tank they are using their abilities mostly and often have AA reset like Malph or Renek or even Shen soo removing W slow wont really make her battles against tanks any diffrent... And its true dmg you want to look in if you need  nerf... \n\nOr you can just revert her rework... but that would make her even more broken TBH\n\nI think i said what i wanted and i probably will get downwoted but idc as long as i told my opinion coming from Fiora main since 2013\n\n","replies":[]}]}
