A lot of teams at Riot are touched by art in some way or another. There's a lot of disciplines working together all the time to create awesome content. Some of the components of the Art Team are:\n\n* Concept - Usually 2D artists in charge of the idea phase of an asset. Concept artists work on everything from character creation, to environment design, UI and illustration. They help flesh out our world and design the next new thing, or reinvent the old.\n\n* 3D Character - 3D artists who work in Zbrush, Maya and other programs to built and texture the character models you see in game. Whether they be champions, skins, creatures, or anything that's a life form, these guys make it into an actual thing.\n\n* 3D Environment - 3D artists who make our maps in which our characters live in. They use the same tools as character artists to build the world that the game is played in. They set the stage for our characters to stand on.\n\n* Animation - Animators bring static objects to life. Anything that has to move is moved by them. Characters that run, creatures who hop, structures that crumble. If it moves, our animators made it do so.\n\n* VFX - Visual Effects Artists, sometimes referred to as Particle Artists, are responsible for our effects in the game. Whether they come from a character, a prop, a creature, or an item. VFX artists make the spells fly.\n\n* Motion Graphics - MoGraph artists bring our login screens to life. They make our mana bars bubble, our logos move and generally make a ton of awesome. They weave spells which I still don't understand to move 2D assets and make them live. \n\n* **LOTS OF OTHER ARTISTS** - We never want to leave anyone out, but we have a ton of amazing people who work in the Art Team, and I may be forgetting some. Hopefully they'll come smack me on the back of the head if I forget them.\n\nFor art discussions in this board, here's what we'd like to do! Generally this is a place where we'd like to host discussions about art in League of Legends. This means that this is the place to discuss such things as, but not limited to:\n\n**Character design:** How our champions, skins, creatures or other characters look and feel.\n\n**Art process:** How we go about designing, creating and bringing to life the things you see in League of Legends.\n\n**Feedback:** You letting us know what you think, and us letting you know why we do the things we do. A two-way street for us to jam.\n\nThose are just a few topics that can be encompassed in this board. If you want to know how we make art, this is the place to find out!! If you notice a mistake, feel passionate about a direction we've taken, or just want to discuss art in general, here's your place! Promoting a respectful and engaging place for our artists to post and our players to ask, discuss, or just hang out.\n\nAs a side note, skin and champion concepts should be posted elsewhere on the Boards. We love your art and ideas; however, please share them on the Skins & Champion Concepts board!\n\nWith all that said, welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"Moobeat","date":"2014-09-22T21:56:00.778+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"so where do i go for the new teemo skins","replies":[{"poster":"Sunfield","date":"2014-09-22T21:58:06.152+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hell's a safe bet I think","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WindShade","date":"2014-09-22T21:55:05.196+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This board is going to be much better than just sending you carrier pigeons.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-09-22T22:01:29.169+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know!

Orianna looks incredible in her splash art but in game her head is too big and she looks completely different.. I think the direction your taking the art is very good for the future of the game but some of the ingame changes that are coming arnt so good.. for example why are the in game champions getting a nerf on there visuals.. all the texture rebalances look like your taking a step backwards. the game is gonna look like a smash brothers game instead of a game based on war.. I think the idea is right but the level of detail that is being removed is to much.. the champions look better but bare. each champion needs to stand out as a hero worth being in the game and worth being some persons favorite champion that they spam during games there number one. This means a balanced roster like you guys do with nerfs and buffs AND visuals worth of comic book art. shyvana must look like the shyvana splash art people, its way too cool for a art junkie like me not to notice.","replies":[{"poster":"Freljordan","date":"2014-09-25T03:44:13.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the lack of in game detail to some extent is limited by technology probably.
