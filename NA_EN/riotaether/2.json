These emails include a list of accounts attached to your email address, as well as links to learn more about why we're making these changes. For some, that list might include forgotten accounts—maybe you were on vacation in another region, maybe you signed up for PBE, maybe you wanted to play with a friend who lives somewhere else. While most cases of username duplication are legitimate instances of two different people having the same username that **have to be addressed**, having a list of your accounts decreases the chance of you accidentally taking your username away from yourself. And just to clarify, the email **will not** let you know if a different player has the same username as you, due to security risks that arise even if we don't tell you exactly who has the account or what region they're on. \n\nUnfortunately, the process of distributing those emails is taking longer than planned. As a result, some of you have run into a mandatory in-client prompt to change your username without knowing why we're asking you to, and without having the account information the email provides. **We've disabled the in-client prompt for now** until the email distribution process is complete. You'll see a dismissable version of the prompt come back soon to make as many people aware of the upcoming change as possible, but we won't make the prompt mandatory again until all emails have been sent.\n\nWe know this transition has caused a lot of confusion. Our hope is that features like the client's \"Stay Signed In\" toggle will minimize the frustration of having to adjust to a new username, and that by getting this process done now, your experiences with the upcoming games announced during the 10-year anniversary stream will be smooth.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please check out [the support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037264394-Riot-Accounts)!","replies":[{"poster":"xGene","date":"2019-11-27T23:10:40.963+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm ok with changing my name with some information attached, but turning on MANDATORY in-client prompt before the emails are all sent is really messed up, I sincerely hope you guys don't EVER do anything this forcefully before letting the users know what's going on.

The dead account is not the one that should be catered to, the active one is.\n\nEven the actual public summoner names allow for people to take them if the account it's on has been inactive, why should the usernames work the other way around?\n\n---\n\nIf you can't find a way to implement a system such as this here's an example of a process that seems _a lot_ more reasonable to me:\n\n1. automatically rename accounts with duplicate usernames to something that can be reliably generated (such as \"username#region\") but for database reference only (can't use this to log-in);\n2. allow the active account to take over \"username\" (without #region at the end);\n3. Current status: one account is renamed to \"username\"; other accounts are renamed \"username#region\" but inaccessible except via the way mentioned below\n4. flag the account for \"legacy ambiguity\" or whatever on the back-end (This means that at some point the username was opened up for an account to take while other accounts that shared it were inactive)\n5. if a (non region specific) log-in attempt is failed with that username (and not all dead accounts have yet been recovered) at any point in the future display a secondary prompt (along \"forgot your password?\" but not mandatory!) that redirects them to the [update-account](https://update-account.riotgames.com/) page where they can log-in with their old information (\"username\" + their password and selecting the specific region by drop-down menu) where they'll be able to change their username (As the shared one has already been assigned to someone who came first and/or was active at the time of the migration)\nCurrent status: First (and/or? only active) account to migrate retains \"username\", any other account that returned gets prompted on failed log-in to change the username to something else.\n\nThis would:\n\n* allow for active accounts to retain the username if other accounts that share it are abandoned\n* allow for inactive accounts that used to share a username with other accounts on other servers to be recovered and not lost at any time (Kinda sucks for them but in all fairness they would've been inactive at the time so not much to stand on)\n\n\n---\n\nIn short: The user that presumably gave the account the most value (not monetary but time investment) is prioritized over inactive (and/or totally abandoned) accounts.\n\n\n######As opposed to the current version where the most inactive account is rewarded while punishing the most active one. (example: If I wanted to play today (and I did) I would've had to change the username (but I didn't because ~~hell to the no~~ no thank you) so by now I'd effectively already be screwed out of my username even though I'm the one who's active on it as opposed to the other accounts I could publicly find that seem to have been for all intents and purposes completely dead and abandoned for years)\n\n\n######I'm gonna be honest though, the fact that any sort of system that prioritizes active players over abandoned accounts is actually insane to me.
