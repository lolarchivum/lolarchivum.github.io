Unless your team has easy engage and lockdown, any Kog&#039;Maw who isn&#039;t braindead can carry once it gets far enough into the game for him to get the requisite items, and God help you if there&#039;s a Lulu or something similar on his team.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s just League of Legends&#039; biggest time bomb, and all of his strength is based around **one ability**, which happens to be one of the least interactive abilities in the game. He builds attack speed, presses W, and goes to town on your team. The counterplay is either end before he reaches that power spike or have the right pieces in place to keep that damned mouth of his shut and hope that you do a better job of murdering him than the other team does protecting him.\r\n\r\nBut if the Kog&#039;Maw is premade with someone else, like a Lulu, and they both know what they&#039;re doing, they can still decimate your team if you&#039;re not coordinated enough. Sure, you can itemize against him, with stuff like Thornmail, Randuins, and Frozen Heart, but if he gets ahead that won&#039;t be enough to stop him without proper focus and followup.\r\n\r\nSo can we please look into some changes for the guy?","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-09-03T18:42:19.304+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":19,"body":"I'd argue that Jax is a bigger time bomb, but at least he has to get in your face to kill you in .1 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-09-03T21:34:54.676+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":28,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limrick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rhNH0kWb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-03T18:42:19.304+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d argue that Jax is a bigger time bomb, but at least he has to get in your face to kill you in .1 seconds.\n\nJax is not a late-game hypercarry.","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-09-03T21:40:57.923+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":4,"body":">Jax is not a late-game hypercarry.\n\nwat","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-09-03T21:49:30.892+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limrick,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rhNH0kWb,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-09-03T21:40:57.923+0000)\n>\n> wat\n\nSimple, he's not a late game hypercarry.\n\nBack when dodged used to be absolute bullshit he was (but it was basically by virtue of him being broken).

Moving power isn't fixing the problem, it's just delaying the inevitable making his power spike come an ability level up later.
