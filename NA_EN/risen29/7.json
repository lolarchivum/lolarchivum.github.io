Low Elo players and people just playing them casually did poorly on them since release, since they are pretty hard to play and have alot of skill expression. But people mastering them were warping the whole game around them.\n\nNo, Azir and Kalista were never problematic because of thier skill ceiling. No champion has ever been regarded as a problem solely on the basis of having a low skill floor and high skill ceiling. \nTheir problem is just they both do too much too well because of poorly designed kits. So it's difficult to make them good without them being overpowered in skilled hands. For instance, Azir's mobility is totally unecessary, goes against his theme, yet forces you to tone down every other aspect of his kit to prevent him from being overpowered in skilled hands. Because he pokes, hypercarries, and has an aoe knockback. \n\nOrnn doesnt suffer from that problem. His kit is not fundamentally flawed in its core design. And his unstoppable fits with his thematic rather than completely contradicting it like azirs engagement mobility (why does a commander who doesnt fight directly, who has a whole kit to support this playstyle, suddenly want to dive into the enemy team when he's not even going to be directly auto attacking them?) \n\nThere are ways to tweak Ornn to keep his unstoppable, and have him not be overpowered in skilled hands. On the other hand, it's hard to keep Azir's positional abilities unnerfed as long as he has access to such mobility. They are design contradictions that let him do too much. \n\nBecause of that, most players agree Riot was being way too rash in rushing to take away his unstoppable rather than tweaking other variables first. \nIt would be akin to taking away Azirs turret. No, that was never his real problem. All you're doing is taking away something cool and iconic that actually fits with his core theme of being a positional commander type. \n\nThats why the unstoppable removal is such a gut punch to players who loved Ornns thematic and design. It ultimately wasnt necessary. There were other ways to balance him. And his unstoppable is a key part of his thematic, going along with his ability to break walls by charging. Everything about this guy says I'm barreling towards you and I won't be stopped, like a charging ram.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-05-11T16:44:00.086+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"If a champion has a very low skill floor and a high skill ceiling, that means in the end that the champion will always be problematic in one tier of play.\n\nIf you balance that champion around high elo, then he will be decent there, but absolutely underpowered in low elo and will feel bad for playing picking him up.\n\nIf you balance around low elo, then the champion will feel good to pick up, but he will completely demolish high elo and warp the game around him.\n\nThat's what happens with champions with too much difference between skill floor and skill ceiling. And that's what's happening with Kalista and Azir. They will never be allowed to be decent in low tier of play, because they potential if mastered is simply too high.\n\nI get that you miss that part of his kit, since it was a \"cool thematic strength\", but in the end I think that this should be a defining strength of a champion. A champion should be designed around the idea of being unstoppable on such a low CD.\n\nOrnn has alot of unique strengths, I don't see this particular one as necessary.\nI stay to that, I think removing the unstoppable was ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-05-11T18:52:03.187+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SatomiKun,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tTcjW21Q,comment-id=000100000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-05-11T16:44:00.086+0000)\n>\n> If a champion has a very low skill floor and a high skill ceiling, that means in the end that the champion will always be problematic in one tier of play\n> If you balance that champion around high elo, then he will be decent there, but absolutely underpowered in low elo and will feel bad for playing picking him up.\n> If you balance around low elo, then the champion will feel good to pick up, but he will completely demolish high elo and warp the game around him.\n> That&#x27;s what happens with champions with too much difference between skill floor and skill ceiling. And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening with Kalista and Azir. They will never be allowed to be decent in low tier of play, because they potential if mastered is simply too high.\n\nWrong. There are plenty of immensely high skill ceiling champions that are still fine at lower elo or in casual play, like Riven. And, conversely, there are plenty of higher skill champions that perform like garbage at low elo, but nobody is concerned with it because they aren't overpowered in the middle or upper tiers (Aurelion Sol, Ivern). \nRiot has also contradicted your own claims by saying they have no problem with specifically balancing some champions around the fact that they are high skill ceiling intended for pro play, like Ryze. \n\nThe cause of the problem is not that a big gap exists between floor and ceiling.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with that on it's own. That is, in fact, the basis of what makes a game competitive. You can't remove that without the game ceasing to be fun or interesting. \n\nThe cause of the problem in these kinds of cases is that the kits are overloaded to the point where having things tuned just a bit too high causes them to spiral out of control in pro hands. Usually because they have no clear weakness in their kit designs, so they just do everything too well. Azir and Kalista fall into that design trap. This makes it impossible to just nerf them the way you would a typical champion like Viktor who has a very clear and straitforward design philosophy with strengths and weaknesses that you can tweak. \n\nOrnn is not comparable to Azir, who has clear contradictions in his design that make him both someone who fights from a distance and someone who wants to dive into a teamfight for no real reason; because nothing in Ornn's kit contradicts the core design of an unstoppable CC tank. Ornns kit is consistent with itself. It was just overtuned. He merely had too much damage given the amount of utility and defense at his disposal. A simple tweak to his damage output could have solved all these problems of him being overbearing in top lane as a duelist without having to sacrifice all the fun and unique aspects of his kit that make him an effective skill expressive tank.\n \nInstead they want to sacrifice his utility for damage? That is nonsense. He is a tank, not a juggernaut. \nThey dropped the ball by trying to strip the wrong things away from Ornn, and taking away one of his funnest and most iconic aspects in the process.\nIt was a mistake. They need to revert it and tinker with his damage/defense if necessary.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pupel","date":"2018-05-11T04:56:40.128+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"The should have reverted his W buff back to current HP instead of Max HP","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-05-11T20:57:46.970+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the only they they did positive for him balance wise and it by itself is broken.

In an environment saturated with crowd control, and where CC affects melee champions the most, I think CC mitigation and immunity should be a much more common tool for melee champions who are otherwise lacking in range or mobility. Considering how there's generally a whole bunch of CC any team can output, choosing which ones to soak up and which ones to block constitutes valid tactical gameplay, imo, and simply timing one's own CC immunity properly to block an effect from a single opponent also demonstrates meaningful mechanical skill. This is why Ornn's own unstoppability felt skill-expressive, because it gave him an extra layer of gameplay in outplaying his opponent in lane and powering through crowd control at the right time in later fights.\n\nAs a side note, I also think part of the problem with CC is that there's simply too much of it, and that we need to take out a lot of CC effects, and reduce the duration of some, on most champions in League. However, even in this environment desaturated from CC, I think we should still have many more champions with the tools to become less vulnerable to CC. Unstoppability, self-cleanses and Tenacity I think should be hallmark mechanics on juggernauts, whose lack of mobility and reach means they otherwise have few to no means of outplaying kiting. Not only would this add more mastery potential to a class whose skill ceiling is mostly rather low, it would also potentially allow them to equalize their performance across higher and lower elos, whereas currently they tend to stomp pubs in Bronze to Gold, yet suffer practically everywhere else.

The ability starts off with a MASSIVE cooldown and stays relatively high all game. If you want to fight him in his W that is entirely on you (let alone get hit by the auto afterwards). He is already slow as hell so it isn&#x27;t like Rumble who can use W to move FASTER during his frontal cone.\n\n \nExactly. People often misuse the term \"counterplay\" without understanding it's real meaning.\n\nWhen trynd ults and you kite him until it wears out, because that's the only option you have available, that's counterplay. You can't just sit there like a potato and die to him, then whine that it should be removed from the game because you don't have any button you can press or micro you can perform that will let you kill him through his ultimate. Your only option is to kite. \n\nCounterplay is sometimes simply decision making, tactics, or teamwork. \n\nSome people have a wrong idea that counterplay means you have an ability you can click to counteract whatever the enemy has just done. Or it has to be something you can juke and micro your way around. But that's not always the case, nor does it have to be in order to be countered.\n\nSometimes the counter play is as simple as just not giving them the opening to use their ability effectively by adjusting your tactics or strategy.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-05-11T14:39:49.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You sorta just proved my point.  The counterplay to Tryndamere is to wait until he pops his ult and then kite and CC him and rip ignite on him so he dies after it ends.  Same goes for Ornn.  The difference is you couldn't kite him before because he was unstoppable.  If you want to compare them, then you would have to make Trynd unstoppable during his ult and see how poorly that goes.  It is essentially the same thing.  Now, after the nerf, running away and CCing him is sufficient counterplay because you can actually do that now.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-05-11T15:14:31.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali is SO HOT,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tTcjW21Q,comment-id=0006000000010000,timestamp=2018-05-11T14:39:49.946+0000)\n>\n>   The difference is you couldn&#x27;t kite him before because he was unstoppable. \n\nThats a lie. Nothing stops you from running the other direction. Ornn even did you an favor and slowed himself to make it easy on you. \n\nNot everyone who faces trynd has cc or slows. How do you think I beat him 1vs1 when I play shyvana? Tactics. I run when he activates it. I dont come on here and cry about how there is supposedly no counterplay because I dont have CC on my champion. \n\nThere were other ways to deal with Ornns W to make it easier to play around, like increased cooldown. And the other option was to make it less damaging and more defensive/utility.\n\nThe point here is not that his W didn't need nerfs, but is was completely unecessary to remove an iconic and fun part of his W when there were plenty other ways it could have been nerfed first.

However, Ornn has his E to close the gap and his ult to knock you up to make it harder for you to run away.  Therefore, the best way to play around his W is to stop him from getting to you in the first place by CCing him to stop him in his tracks.  The counterplay of CCing Trynd is still there regardless of whether or not you picked a champion with CC.  If you manage to get a whole team of champions with 0 CC, then that's your fault.\n\nI'm all for giving his unstoppable back on his W if Riot makes the ability less powerful and changes it in a way where you can stay and fight Ornn when he pops it instead of only being able to run away and CCing him.  With how powerful his current W is, it should not allow him to be unstoppable.  Lower the range, increase the mana cost, change the damage to %current health, or lowering the shield could be potential changes to allow him to get unstoppable back, but currently he shouldn't have it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-05-11T14:33:13.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Running away is not sufficient counterplay to an ability that is already super powerful to begin with.  He gets a shield, does %max health damage, and applies brittle with a single ability.  What is an interactive way to minimize the benefit he gets from popping W?  CCing him.  But wait, you can't CC him remember?  Now your only option is for your entire team to run away from him while he applies Brittle to everyone and sets up the rest of his team to CC lock you for the rest of eternity.  Being able to lock him down with CC means he can't automatically apply Brittle to your whole team without having to put any thought into the timing of popping his W.  Now he needs to be more considerate when doing this instead of just popping it and running right in with no consequences.  Not to mention that he already has 50 extra range compared to a lot of melee champs which makes him all that much harder to play against Brittle to begin with.\n\nAlso, Rumble has to use 2 abilities to get the same effect and needs to use 3 abilities (compared to 1) if he wants to CC you on top of that all of which can make him overheat very quickly.  He is also not unstoppable when he does this so you can CC him and stop him from doing damage to your team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KZ Engel","date":"2018-05-11T19:19:11.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"he just does way too much dmg for a tank, even now\n\ngive unstoppable back, nerf w dmg","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-05-11T22:52:55.426+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His original problem was that he did too little damage even when he won lane.
