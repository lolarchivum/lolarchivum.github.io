In practise, you're never going to get off an E + W or a Q + W on even a few members of their team which means he's just straight up weaker. For example, before if you did W + R across their entire team you would get 2 passive procs + R, W damage; now you just get W + R damage.

If riot doesnt revert the nerfs to his W and E they should at least let his ult stack his passive he will remain weak. I would gladly trade in lower ratios and numbers on his ult just to have the stacking back.\n\nUsually there isnt enough time or the enemy isnt positioned to allow for combos, you need to just ult and kite with the rest of your abilities. Another problem Riot probably didnt foresee was that Vel'Koz W second trigger is delayed just enough that E>W>R on someone means .5~ seconds of your ult doesnt even get the true damage.

The only thing missing is her old passive but first it was stupid on a long range mage and second her zone control has gone up by a ton with her new passive. Good luck engaging her with an army of plants ready to unleash on your team.\n\nOverall she went up at least onetier as support. She has the potential to be a strong AP support instead of a niche/weird pick. Really the only thing i hate for new Zyra is the fact that i wanted to add to my mains another tank support beside Allistar(oversaturated at range supports).","replies":[{"poster":"RasCaelestis","date":"2016-05-07T17:41:01.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only seen two Zyras since the rework.  One was on my team as Support when I was top-lane, and I'll admit, I didn't pay close attention to it since both our lanes were going well, so I didn't need to TP down to help.  \n\nThe second one I saw was in mid, against me.  I was Vel'Koz and still getting used to his new kit (overall not a fan, but I can see what Riot was going for), but that lane was miserable.  My friend started spectating me during that game and his description of her is perfect:  \"Biological Heimerdinger.\"  I'm not sure if it was just that I was still re-learning Vel, but it felt like there was no way I could push lane against her.  She constantly had at least 3-6 plants up and shooting anything near them.  While they didn't last as long as Heimer turrets or do as much damage on a 1-1 basis, the fact that there were so many up at once was incredibly annoying.  My team won the game, and even though I killed Zyra in mid a few times, any of the times I was able to push forward, she'd undo all I did in seconds, and I'd be forced back again.  \n\nIt was also strange that sometimes seeds would become plants when Zyra's abilities didn't hit them (unlike how her old kit worked).  Any seeds even in the general area of all her abilities triggered, and it was really unclear when that would happen.  She'd miss her root/slow, and I'd think I was in the clear, only to be poked down by plants that were suddenly on all sides of me.  \n\nIt didn't feel OP, as I was able to fight her a few times and could win trades, but I did not enjoy laning against her at all, and I can see it being incredibly oppressive, regardless of who/what Zyra is against.","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-05-07T18:16:11.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra's spell have extra radius for procing plants.

Here  I went against her at mid (Dont ask how i got mid as fill, amusing for support main) with Karma and did pretty good. As i know both sides. i focused on farming when she had plants around me. The shield made her life quite difficult as not only soaks damage from plants but makes skilshots difficult to land. After she proced her plants i went to the offensive where i had more effective tools to win trades and she had less seeeds available. Managed to beat her at lane by a fair margin. \n\nAs about pushing against her. I didnt(her tower fell at 20min mark), instead prioritized quick clears(and with morelos/echoes it was pretty fast) and helping somewhere else. If nothing was happening and she was MIA, then i would push. Tbh me and ww kept the mid game going with roams and plays. If you see my build order after i build morelo(11:28) i didnt go to base for 8 minutes as i was clearing and roaming, covering etc. It was a tense mid game with a lot of action. Bot was strugling with Bard free week (dont judge it was normal) and Yasuo had a hard time top vs Jayce. We pulled Jayce bot, Cait managed to recover and late game with bard and Karma she managed to have great dmg output.\n\nSo she seems a strong laner, but not so great roamer. Champs that can clear efficient and roam well are good matchups (loose lane, win game). Ahri, TF may be strong against her for that reason. For support, prob sustain or better poke. The obnoxius Nami Cait should work pretty good.
