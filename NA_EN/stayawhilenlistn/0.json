Animation canceling, using an ability before flashing and having the ability go off from where you flash to, flashing over walls/placing wards over walls that are longer than the cast distance, etc. \n\nThe reason these topics should be covered is so it's clearer what Riot thinks is a mechanic and what's actually a bug. Casting Flash or Zhonyas in the middle of chain CC use to be a \"feature\" before it was bug fixed. \n\nAlso, would it be worth linking to some of these videos in the client somehow? I think in general people visiting the forums are more familiar with these concepts but I bet there are a lot of players that don't participate on the boards that would be blown away by the concepts in videos like what you showed.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2015-06-03T09:49:53.311+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nUnfortunately there isn't one simple answer for this; animation cancelling is so central to Riven's kit that I feel we'll always support it on her (Xypherous has said before that fighting games were a big influence on Riven's design); getting a flash in between two CCs was never meant as a feature, but simply was a bug that literally took us four years to fix. We ended up having to rewrite how CCs are applied and tracked and bug fix this against every single debuff in the game. This is not a trivial undertaking.\n\nAs a designer I notice myself falling for the fallacy of symmetry very often. It feels like there's gotta be clean, simple rules that are abstract and universal enough that they can be applied to anything. For instance, \"if you flash during the middle of an ability, the ability should fire from where you end up rather than where you were before the flash.\" Unfortunately, the world is much messier than that. Sometimes these symmetrical rules exist and are useful to apply, but almost all of the time you end up in a situation where making exceptions is, while less aesthetically pleasing, actually the healthier approach to the game. For instance, Azir's R is an exception to the flash during cast rule. The reason is that the soldiers appear at the beginning of the cast time and move forward during the cast time. This decision was made to enable reaction-casting the R as a \"oh shit\" panic button. Whatever we may now think of that decision (I still think it was the right decision; plus **[it looks SUPER COOL](https://youtu.be/hlsX3eG3iK4?t=13s)** in slow motion when the soldiers charge forward in sync with his R animation), it necessitated breaking the flash rule. In other cases we broke the flash rule because abilities became completely overbearing when the player could choose to flash at the very last second. Thresh's Q flash is a good example here.\n\nLee Sin's ward hopping was a bug on release; we meant for him to be able to jump to ally champions and minions only, not to wards. We fixed this bug soon after his release, but the community outcry showed us that this play had become a core part of his loop, and we reinstated it (eventually balancing around it; he no longer gets a shield when he jumps to a ward, for instance). \n\nOne of my personal pet peeves is what happens to dashes with an effect at the end if they don't get to the target champion. For instance, if Irelia is stopped in mid-Q, should she still do damage to the target that she didn't even reach? If the target flashes away and Irelia merely arrives at the place where her target used to be, should she deal damage? This is not an easy question at all, and to this day there are heated discussions about this within the design department. I originally made the case that they should NOT; thematically the champion does the effect to you as they close to you. This was silly of me; I fell for the fallacy of symmetry. Because while this is an easy case to make for the likes of Irelia or Jayce, it gets much harder for Pantheon. If you flash away from Pantheon's W, should he still stun you? In the case of using a flash, it seems pretty straight forward: you blew a long cooldown summoner for a short cooldown basic ability. But what if you're playing against, say, LeBlanc or Lucian? They can cover pretty much the same distance or more that flash gives them in pretty much the same time; should this mean that Pantheon can now never ever stun a LeBlanc as long as she hits W in time? That would break Pantheon's pattern completely. So the answer there is \"no\". The extended answer is we should probably look at Pantheon's kit at some point because a kit that falls apart if you remove a point and click stun is probably not super robust in the first place. \n\nSo to wrap up: very often if you'll ask us \"is this a glitch or intended\", the answer is going to be \"interesting. Let us think about this\", and then 4 different designers will give you 14 different answers. We always have to look at the specific context and think through any potential unintended consequences of \"cleaning up\" a glitch.\n\nThe ward placement / dash/flash range extension across walls is a general usability pattern. It really sucks (and is incredibly hard to predict) when your dash/flash is a few units short of clearing a wall. Instead of face-planting a player (or placing the ward on this side of the wall) we generally do a thing where we check 100 or so units farther along the cast vector to see if that location is a valid location, and if so we pretend the spell has that much range. So that's not even a glitch: that's us manually making spells less painful to use across walls.","replies":[{"poster":"Tönight We","date":"2015-06-03T12:57:57.923+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the best response ever.
