Also, many people will go full AP quints on her (I'm stuck with my AD quints because they cost too much xD), which means your auto's are weaker, aka worse clear. Her passive isn't the most effective clear. Nocturne's is much stronger early (as well as that sustain), and her jungle really gets easier once you hit 6.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-11-14T00:24:20.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tested her clear in a custom game with no leash.\n\nRune: Attack Speed Marks, AP Quints, Flat Armor Seals, Scaling MR Glyphs\nMasteries: 12/18/0 (Runic Affinity, not Secret Stash.

They're a little too tough (more damage than red or blue). My usual path is Krugs (Smite), Red, Wolves (Smite), Rift Scuttle, Blue, recall.

When playing him in particular, you did your first clear which was usually:\nKill your red/blue with box stack(which is actually harder now since cds and the spawn time doesn't line up the same way as S5.\nGo to enemy buff opposing yours, steal or kill enemy jungler.  Crab, check lanes for gank, go back to farm.\n\nAt that last part, if you go back to farm, in a lot of situations this is what happens:\nYou're low in hp from either stealing or killing jungler and have to back, which sets you behind\nor\nYou didn't manage to do either, you've wasted time, and since you're probably the worst clearing jungler in the game, you're going to fall behind against your opposing jungler\n\nNow, his issue is complicated even further by the Tiamat change, it was essentially required item in S5, and now with the passive removal, he just continues to be a really slow clear.
