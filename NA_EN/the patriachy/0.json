And your right black cleaver isn't the best in every situation no item is, the main reason you would get black cleaver instead of LDR items is it's mainly targeted at melee champs/bruisers who want a armor pen item with health as well to survive longer. For most it would make them too squishy if they went LDR.

Even chess has problems with first turn advantage.  In a first person shooter the side of the map you're on often has advantages unless its completely symetrical and boring.  Assymetry even to the smallest degree will create imbalance, but its also an important part of creating a long lasting interesting game.\n\nLeague is designed from the ground up to be assymetrical.  Picks and bans are assymetrical.  The sides of the map are flipped to be assymetrical.  And every champion in the game even if you take the same role is assymetrical.  Even champions that are arguably clones like Ashe and Varus have enough differences to where its substantial.  There should be zero expectations that the game will be 100% balanced, let alone in a week.\n\nThe thing everyone wants though is a game that _feels_ fair and balanced.  If something has like 1-2% more or less winrate and this is the case across the entire champion roster, you can have even power budgets on everyone and have a game that feels balanced.  But even that is a shot in the dark and League has only ever gotten close to it, there are always OP/UP outliers and outliers that are actually balanced but very skill dependent.\n\nI think there should be more pressure on the balance team to make positive changes to the game, after all they do way too many -3 AD, -5 MS, -10 base damage changes that never fundamentally address problems in the game.  Those kind of nudges are fine on champions that are close to balance or are very new, but when we have champions who've been oppressive for months and we know they're busted there's no excuse for such a soft approach.  This is what's frustrating about the balance team, not the fact they don't do a perfect job.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-11-14T14:56:18.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"....
