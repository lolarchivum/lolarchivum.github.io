This first one will be more of a background to keep in mind while demolishing yasuo mains everywhere; the second will actually be suggested nerfs and reworks.\n\nI want to start by saying that i truly believe that the problem of yasuo is that he is too popular; everyone makes guides about yasuo and teaches everyone else how to play yasuo, how to build yasuo, and essentially how to win with yasuo. Yasuo has a high skillcap which is true b/c of the amazing things u can do with yasuo's e that requires a bit of creativity and practice to pull off (like using the dogs in the x area to jump over the wall shown in this picture: http://prntscr.com/c3sos4) but he has an average skill base (skill to start playing) because of the vast number of guides. Even so, these are his win rates in plat elo or higher: http://prntscr.com/c3spdj\n\nThe main problem with these guides is that people don't make guides to avoid losing to yasuo: for example, realizing that yasuo has a really strong lvl 1-3, depending on the matchup, and still strong lvl 1-5 for most matchups; he falls off till late only after 6, if he didn't start snowballing. Other examples could be getting morgana, kindred, or other powerful non skillshot reliant teamfighting champs (that means not u miss fortune) as a counter pick. This means that Yasuo will take a fair bit of work to balance and that, to be honest, the best way to balance him is to constantly nerf and strengthen his damage; you could say he is a representation of league.\n\nThe other part of his popularity is that a lot of smurfs actually end up playing him (I am at fault b/c after i got gold, i decided to go get more gold accounts with much higher win rates to see how much i learned as i climbed). Is it really fair to have guys who have stats like this in the mathematics? http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=tempestreformed. he had/has a smurf with 95% win rate on yasuo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVudjASoCFw.  there was another guy who had 74% win rate on yasuo but i can't find his account. This is actually true for many of the high elo yasuo smurfs. Because he is popular, more smurfs play him and dramatically skew the data.","replies":[{"poster":"Beast Naruto","date":"2016-08-10T04:03:39.196+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok if Tanksuo is what we choose to blame, my favored idea would be \n\nRework 1: the one suggested by a player below me who says to have scaling defenses for tanks. This way true tanks get more benefits of tankiness while offtanks or fighters get a bit lower benefits. This will reduce the chance of anyone else like vayne or graves suddenly becoming problems. (Graves already had his time)\n\nGuys, remember yasuo is a fighter, he isn't supposed to be squishy, he is supposed to be like a diana (best representation cause of shield), xin zhao, (erm lcs ekko), nocturne, etc. In all honesty, to me champions/players should be building according to how the game is going. It makes little sense to me to keep building full damage when u are super far behind with a nonadc other than vayne ;) just a suggestion. If someone rushes a randuin's omen and a frozen heart, why would i rush shiv/ie? I would prefer to rush maybe a black cleaver+bork or a frozen heart+triforce to kite them. (bork takes objs like barons and goes through hp tanks); triforce takes turrets.\n\nAnother idea could be \n\nRework 2: Arkadata's. I just would strongly emphasize that his lvl 1 q not be nerfed. Right now, his e's and lvl 1 q give him a strong lvl 1-5 (or lvl 1-3) depending on the matchup before he gets ridiculously weak till late game, unless he starts to snowball.\n\nIn the end though, to be honest, I just don't like seeing removing versatility from the game. To me, fervor of battle is a real problem. It is more or less the to-go mastery for every adc. I find it a bit ironic since the new mastery system was added so that we wouldn't all pick the same things in the same situation.\n\nMy last idea would be to add an item to removes shield though. I think shields are the one thing that have no counter play. Now, i would not say add one that prevents the flow from stacking up. Looking at recent history, shield holders like lulu (remember pro play last year), janna, tahm, etc and now sterak gage holders are just being annoying.\n\nYa, I'm trying to say don't change yasuo's moves, although nerfs are fine and don't weaken his early game (lvl 1 q and his es).

And his ultimate isn't the problem, it's like hitting an extra basic attack, nothing much really. His ult is an essential part of his kit that should be up most of the time since it's reliant on allies or his 3rd Q which is kinda hard to do it on your own and you might get peeled off and die. The real solution that makes him \"omg op plz nerf riot i cant get to diamond becuz of yasuo omfg ;-;\" is what ArkaDaTa said, lower his base numbers and give him more scaling damage. But I doubt it will satisfy you people and you will come on boards again and whine and moan because he's an op champion while secretly playing Malzahar or any other broken shit to gain some elo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-08-02T20:58:26.319+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=enIsBUBF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-02T20:10:34.649+0000)\n>\n> He is looking a bit out of line yeah.

It's completely broken. You did the same with Master Yi, and here it is even more important. It's an effortless engage for a melee, for the distance of his Typhoon, which is huge, and since you can easily entrap almost a whole enemy team in it, it is also absolutely safe. It's just unacceptable for that to be happening with a champion of Yasuo's strength and already huge mobility - twice during one fight, be it in lane or a teamfight.\n\nWhenever a Yasuo was not absolutely shut down by his lane enemy and jungler [which does not happen in low elo, but that is another story], the only times I have still managed to win the games were the times when I shut down Yasuo every teamfight by flashing in and surprise-CCing him before anything else could happen, so my team would have the chance to follow up and stomp him. And then if they were an okay team, we would also win the rest of the fight with two or three people surviving after my heroic almost-suicide. But that is not a solution. Try that in lane, and he is gone into backrow before you have flashed.\nIt is cool that killing a champion requires team effort, even while the rest of the enemy team is hitting at you from all sides. It is not cool if that champ has *two* CC-devices, an engage he can spam, two protective devices, and damage to three-hit every squishy within a second while evading all skillshots with built-in *IAmHere,Wait,IamThere*-damage abilities, just to make sure not even pure damage skillshots can hurt him after the wall is down. If he can use all of that every team fight multiple times, then that is too much for one champion.
