Abuse cases are not entirely dictated by whether or not the champion is designed to synergize with certain items or mechanics. Irelia was meant to be an assassin upon her release, and she transitioned from that into one of the game's stapple top-laners. By your definition, that is because she abused tanky itemization, but she is now recognized as a bruiser. By my own thought, I'd argue that {{champion:157}} abuses crit items because he breaks the rules regarding how characters are meant to scale with these purchases in spite of how he was designed to be a crit-user from the start. \n\nLethality is currently being abused because it is broken.

It only becomes an issue if there are no meaningfull enough tradeoffs compared to the intendet crit builts. However, even now you can see that any lethality adx that doesn't snowball has some issues comeing back, and mostly huge issues burning through tanks. With the PBE nerfs, lethality will probably have a clear enough tradeoff, sacrificeing tank shredding and lategame dps for early-mid power.\nAnd if it stays to potent late/vs tanks, the main issue is the way it stacks with LW items, not lethality on it's own.","replies":[{"poster":"nanogibbon","date":"2017-02-23T17:38:56.564+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, Jhin always seemed like a special case to me - while a lot of classic ADC items can feed him due to his passive, he's always going to be open to somewhat unique or assassin-like builds.
