Their actual position on damage, is that there is too much *Upfront* damage, with their belief that average damage is overall the same. Which as they have been going about, having been trying to lessen upfront damage, which is shown by the concept of the new DH (even if it might be a miss) and a lot of the nerfs to Runes that occurred months ago. \n\nCancer is subjective, Akali's only pain is the true stealth thing, other than that she's honestly pretty well made. That's ignoring, however, that those are not because of the Balance team. Thats the Champion Design team you're complaining about, so another thing you're wrong about. \n\nDark Harvest, I don't know if that's due to the Balance Team or not, but once again, New DH follows Riot's stance that *upfront* damage is too high, so they chose to backload. There's room to balance it with a lower Proc value of Percentage health, because it's now backloaded. But nah, we're crying for reverts before a week has even passed. \n\nI haven't had an opinion on DH's power level itself, because I haven't had that many games with it, still adjusting to it from what I've always ran on Kayn, electrocute. Bias is a none issue here, you can check my match history, I haven't played a lot. My opinion on it as a concept however, is where I disagree that it's more toxic than the original, and while i have my problems with it like it proccing from Teemo Shrooms and Karthus ults (Infinite range Ults), I think it's healthier in concept.\n\nIt just needs refining, like plenty people have said, it's execute range could definitely be lower, and I think that's a good idea. But people crying and screaming to revert it, saying it's nothing but garbage and Riot's dumb for implementing, is where I think people are being close minded.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2018-11-25T04:27:05.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Names don't mean shit.

I've said it before and I'll keep saying it. We need to shy away from strictly gold to damage value. Now is the time to get some meta defining counterplay focused items. \n\nIt would be nice to see thornmail get a hard nerf in stats and give it an active with huge damage to anyone hitting them for any damage. We need new ways to counterplay aggressive champs.  Because right now the counter to an assassin is a better assassin to assassinate them first and that's degrading the game.\n\nGive tanks fun and impactful ways to counter them, and Squishies a means to counterplay them solo. All too often I'll play adc on a team full of assassin's, against a team full of them, and be near useless. All I can do is split push and hope that the lane pressure is enough to impact the game because when I group I'm instantly one hit.\n\nRework the tank items imo that would fix the whole game. Maybe take out some of the synergy of builds to create wider diversity of options. The synergy just decentivizes building differently. If you bought archangels, it's very hard to not get roa, void staff and deathcap, and then you have maybe one flex slot.","replies":[]}]}
