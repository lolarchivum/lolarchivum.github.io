Yesterday, i was reading how Neeko is basically LeBlanc 2.0 (because of the trickster thing) while today, i'm reading how Neeko's kit is more suited for Wukong and therefore, should've just prioritized them instead of her...\n\nI'm glad the complainers aren't in charge of the game updates because no matter how you slice it, things are getting quite out of hand. So what, one champion even remotely occupies one design space and now, NOTHING NEW (an item, a rework, a new champ) can even show a similar mechanic, lest Riot be accused of banking dough from the new champion and their skins instead of just improving the older ones?\n\nGet out of town...\nWhen Riot reworked Galio and Aatrox, some people were vocal about them just leaving the old and bad designs in the game and making their reworks as NEW champions. Neeko isn't a Wukong/LeBlanc wannabe but since some players dubbed her that way, IT'S STILL A MISTAKE to have a champion in the remotely same design space as these two? \n\nWhat's the right option here?\nIt's bad to rework champions if Riot's going farther away from their original designs, it's just better to give a new champion that form. But when a new champion is made, that has a vaguely similar mechanic to the already existing (and poorly aged) champion, NOW the argument works in reverse - just make the old champion better, don't design a new one around that mechanic?\n---\n#???\n#Where do these comically bad contradictions end?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDangerousTaco","date":"2018-11-20T14:16:27.809+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think that's the issue though, while I understand where your coming from. I think the players that are upset are that way mainly cause they always wanted better for the champion, only to have it ignored for years and years on end. Riot usually exclaims that they cant find a good design for that champ, yet they introduce a new mechanic that improves a already implemented design way better than the original.\n\nLike for me when xerath players used to have to always zoom on the minimap to see who they were ulting. And bam, jhin comes out with a auto zoom feature.\n\nNot saying your post is wrong, there are players that over exaggerate.

If  this mechanic was Neeko's thing from the start, Neeko isn't a terribly designed champion or even redundant because someone thinks that her mimicry (or W) is better suited for Wukong or LeBlanc.\n\nI too see the similarities but i'm not here twiddling my thumbs, looking to chastise Riot for them having the audacity to make new and exciting champions because they're not cannibalizing every good idea and forcing it down an older champion's throat because it remotely fits them.\n\nA hallmark of good design is to envision a final product, not throw scraps at the old one and seeing what can part can you glue to it to make it appear more functional than the OG version.

Faking using it, then actually using it, etc. A lot of Wukongs I know barely even need to use the W for deceiving people, they just need the stealth to get from a blind spot into the back line with their R. I don't understand your complaint, I don't understand why you think Scara's opinion is worth more than anyone else's.

Not some random streamer that isn't even considered good right now. He finished D2 and a lot of people are considering him washed up rn. Like you realize that what makes wukongs W so great is that it doesn't move right? It means you can, as a wukong, stop moving at any moment and people will think you've used your w.

When you get to an elo where what champion you plays actually matters, you probably have played long enough to own every champion and have extra blue essence to spend on the new champion. I haven't spent money on buying a champion for 5 years. Unless you're smurfing, your point is pretty invalid. If a new player is going to buy a champion, it's probably because they think that champion has  cool thematic.

Actually all of the stats says he&#x27;s a little above average.\n> https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/monkeyking/diamond \n> \n> Look at the stats of a champion that is actually currently bad, like Sejauni, then look at Wukong.\n\nROFL look a little better little buddy. hes challenger in flex, and in d5 in solo q and in fucking turkey. you will never understand if you don't play wukong, so please be quiet while looking at the fucking statistics.\ngo play wukong vs camille/irelia/jax/urgot/fiora/renekton/darius/viktor/etc....................","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-11-21T12:37:38.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=option paralysis,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0leoB6VG,comment-id=0006000100000000,timestamp=2018-11-21T11:25:29.676+0000)\n>\n> ROFL look a little better little buddy. hes challenger in flex, and in d5 in solo q and in fucking turkey. you will never understand if you don&#x27;t play wukong, so please be quiet while looking at the fucking statistics.\n> go play wukong vs camille/irelia/jax/urgot/fiora/renekton/darius/viktor/etc....................\n\nFirst of all, you're listing people who are just lane bullies. Urgot, Renekton, and Darius ARE ALL DESIGNED TO WIN LANE. That is their strength. They're supposed to win early in exchange for them being trash late. That's why in every single one of these match ups, wukong loses lane but has a higher game winrate. Also nothing that you're saying is making Wukong sound like a bad champion. We can all agree, Irellia, Camille, and Jax are extremely powerful right now. They needs nerfs, wukong doesn't need buffs. Also as someone who plays Fiora top often, it's my favorite top laner to play. Wukong vs fiora is a skill match up. Literally the only up side fiora has is maybe her parry into his ultimate, but Wukong has way better base damage and his w to dodge Fiora's q and block her w.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-11-21T16:12:17.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">THERE IS LITERALLY A CHALLENGER PLAYER WUKONG MAIN WITH A 70% + WINRATE.

His winrate has never really dropped below 50%. If you're doing bad as wukong, that's a you thing, not a wukong thing. I'm just looking at the stats. 52% winrate in plat+ with a 0.5% playrate. Aka only his mains are really playing him and he's doing just fine. BTW he has the 3rd highest kill ratio among all junglers, so yeah sure he sucks right now. I seriously think you're just playing wukong wrong if you're having troubles with him. He isn't bad by any means and probably never will be, just as he hasn't been in like forever. I looked at your profile and you have a 64% winrate with wukong, only further proving my point. Why the hell are you complaining exactly?  \n\nStats say he's fine, and has been fine since he first came out. Your profile says you've been doing great with him. Like the hell? Maybe you just don't like his playstyle anymore and so he feels weak to you.. If that's the issue, you should stop playing him, not try to make him sound bad. \n\n\nHere are some quotes directly from r/wukong mains:\n\n\"Am I the only person who already loves his W? I get that the new champs ability is super cool, and with invis it would be cool, but jeez would that be strong. And honestly, I love being able to stop in place and watch how confused the entire enemy team gets. His W already makes for great outplays, but I feel like another champ could use the ability you thought of.\"  https://www.reddit.com/r/Wukongmains/comments/9yizyv/should_wukong_w_work_similar_to_the_new_champions/\n\n**This one is literally a guy making fun of Scarra because he doesn't know wtf he's talking about. A wukong player did suggest adding increased movement speed to wukong's w invis which doesn't sound like a bad idea to me**\n\"LOL even a guy who doesn't play wukong at all.. god damnit. I guess I gotta play Neeko and pretend Im playing wukong. maybe someone picks him and I can turn into him. XD\"  \n\n\"I think the absolute LEAST they could give to his W would be increased movement speed. New abilities out date old kits so hard it's insane. \nOn a side note... I do like Wukong's clone better, at least for his kit. Dropping a clone in a bush is really awesome for ganks imo. It's just way worse for escaping. \"\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Wukongmains/comments/9ys9i1/scarra_seeing_neeko_w_this_reads_as_fuck_you/\n\nThere are some quotes from wukong mains to back up what I'm saying. Literally none of them have an issue with wukong right now. I searched the entire reddit, found no one complaining about him being bad right now. I saw a few posts about them wanting a new passive, but they didn't say that he was bad, they just said his passive was boring. Like I have no idea wtf you're saying when you say wukong is bad. He isn't at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-11-20T21:26:42.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"You are a liar.
