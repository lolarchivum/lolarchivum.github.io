The mountain (called Malphite obviously) ravages Demacia and older Lux gets a bit colorful with her powers trying to take it out, becoming Elementalist Lux in the process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-10-09T18:31:21.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The current understanding at Riot is that skins are not canon.\n\nIs that an absolute statement, or do some exceptions still apply?
