It's an incredibly degenerate play style that removes an important skill from the solo lanes, which is killing minions under pressure from opponent. \r\n\r\nThe problem is two-fold. The \"support\" player is not under pressure to kill many minions and at the same time the enemy laner is often not pressured by the \"support\", thus giving each an easy laning phase. This creates a situation where each player is not interacting with their lane opponent, so it's not very fun. \r\n\r\nLimiting support items to one per team would remove the strategies of Taric middle with Spoils of War passive and enchanters top lane with Tribute passive without change to the champions' current state of balance. A problem that may arise is if someone decides to do this strategy anyways they may steal the support item from the true support. However, doing this would be so sub optimal it's unlikely to be seen as anything other than griefing. \r\n> {{sticker:sg-soraka}}   Please consider this.","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2020-02-05T15:56:48.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so how does the game know who is the troll and who is the support? imagine trying to support when ur top lane stole the support item. there needs to be something more specific","replies":[{"poster":"C0l0urless","date":"2020-02-05T15:58:00.264+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could give us official role swap in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-02-05T17:05:14.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something we really need.\n\nLike, press a button and see if they accept.
