Some were proving pretty tricky - I'll track down where we landed on those last week. I know 1 fix for sure is going into this patch (his Q range will no longer be bugged), but there was also some weird behavioral bugs when flipping over walls he was investigating.\n\nWukong ended up getting put on the backburner for a short amount of time while we re-evaluated the function/success of mini updates/roster scope updates. We'd been exploring him around the same time as the Xin Zhao rework, and there were a few lessons from that release that we wanted to learn from and apply to some of the champions like Wukong that share some similar thematic space and gameplay desire for players (we've seen that Wukong has a similar fantasy that Xin Zhao players and a few others share). For the time being we have him on one of our short lists for the champion team designer to pick up when they're looking for an additional smaller scope project to take on while waiting on iterations for their main project. I can't promise any timelines as usual, but there's only 11 champions on that short list, so I hope that information is better than no thing. Sorry we've been so silent on Wukong, there just hasn't been much to share recently that would feel particularly great, but I realize silence doesn't feel super splendid either. FWIW I think there has to be a better passive for him, and I'd be really interested if we could make him less bound to lethality in order to be viable in a game. Right now if you can't delete their squishies quickly, you don't bring much to a team comp that you couldn't get elsewhere.

YOU are the biggest barrier to finding fun in league of legends right now.\"\n\nIt's time to seriously sit down with all your teams and rethink your approach to the game.\n\n* Stop catering to the needs of the few and start catering to the needs of the many, do not let the LC$ and the pro players dictate what is and isn't fun anymore. By doing this you have caused serious backlash towards the LC$ itself, causing a good portion of the community to hate the very idea of it.\n\n\n* Reorganize your balance team. This is wildly talked about but you cannot ignore the backlash this team has caused. Your balance team is totally and utterly out of control and they need to be taken into another room and spoken to. Something is going on with them that's causing them to tear this game apart, maybe they have some personal issues affecting their judgment? maybe they are under stress, but from them its been nothing but bad calls, community backlash towards them is at an all-time high, you need to reorganize your balance team if you have any hope of fixing the damage they have caused.\n\n\n* Reorganize your priorities. The one good thing you announced was making changes to botlane this season and we all agreed, but then you pulled a complete 180 and suddenly turned your attention towards mages and other things we didn't ask for you, you jumbled up your priorities and can't figure out why we are mad about it. \n\n\n* Have a talk with your skin team. The skin team does good work sometimes but with the recent community review of gun goddess misfortune and the fact that our feedback towards it was ignored outright, its very obvious your skin team is either burnt out or playing favourites. Skins help keep the game fresh and entertaining, though not as large to a  degree as proper gameplay but they do help reignite interest in champions and players. the quality of skins has decreased dramatically over the season, so you should have a sit down with them and ask them whats going on as well.\n\n\n* Stop focusing on complex and overpower champion designs. We all know who's famous for this, CertainlyToxic, but he can have an entire thread dedicated to him and his champions another time. What you need to do right now is review what you're doing with future champions. You are making more and more champions that cater towards causing frustration rather than fun. whatever team decides what skills new champs get and how they work, tell them to go back and re-evaluate those skills, tell them to ask themselves \"Is this skill something that would be fun to use? or something that would cause frustration?\" you'd be surprised how many times the second one is picked I bet.\n\n\n* Finally, and this is the most important one of all. **Stop ignoring feedback**. you may say you do not do this but you do, the only feedback you take into consideration is from LC$ pro players, look at the upcoming mana changes? Do you see how negative the feedback towards them is? do you see how bad the backlash towards them is? yet i bet even as we speak you are still trying your hardest to drown out our feedback and force them out. If you don't want out feedback to begin with why even bother asking us.\n\n\nI have seen a lot of Riot employees say that themselves or other employees don't b0ther communicating with the community because they often get backlash for their answers. Have you ever stopped to wonder why that is? it's not always because the community is trolling, its the reputation the company your representing has among us. If you want us to start treating you with respect you must start respecting us as well.\n\nI really want league of legends to succeed but the path your taking it down now is destined to have it end in failure.

I know you must get a lot of shit because of the limitations on how much you can say, but I hope you don't let it get to you! \nOn the topic of Wukong though, I absolutely love playing him as a diver and I hope that he will still be able to after his rework. I really feel that you have a good understanding of Wukong when you pointed out how he feels with his high highs and low lows, but I think that's really due to his inability to safely farm and lack of sustain, which also really separates the good Wukong from bad. I've had to restrained myself a lot from going for farm and just soak in the exp and wait for the right moment to engage on them while under turret. Hopefully he will get some help in the department of sustain but still be a diver.\nAlso it would be a great QOL buff for Wukong if other champs who hits his clone under turret would get turret aggro, which can be super feels bad for the Wukong player when you make a crucial dodge on someone's ability. This is also the same situation with minion aggro. Currently, minions also do not aggro an enemy who has hit Wukong's  clone even though it's consider a champion. The current interaction seems kinda of inconsistent for me since he's counted as a champion for things like summoner abilities target, illaoi's ulti, darius's q, etc...","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-04-28T13:50:21.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think we've seen in other threads. the sustain creep is generally a bad thing.

J4 has multiple ways of safely farming. Yes there are ways for X champion to do well/compete without sustain, but they have compensation to make up for it. If Wukong walks up to CS it's easy harassing. If he tries to W he's still vulnerable to  CC and AOE dmg.

Either way, whatever I do, it has negative consiquences: not reporting the bug means any additional information my report could have provided will never reach you, worst case is that the bug was actually unknown before. Reporting the bug means any duplicate information my report contains will require somebody to invest time without any additional information gained from it.\n2) It can only hold links, so if I had a screenshot or a video, I'm dependent on the availability of free third party services to provide you with that media. But actually I might not WANT to upload videos for League of Legends bug documentation to my private YouTube channel of high quality cat videos.\n3) Once I sent the report, it's \"lost\" like a letter thrown into a letter box. Neither can YOU ask for clarification because you can't get back to me, nor can I see what happens with my report. All I can do is repeatedly check for the patch notes or check if the bug is still there.\n\nAnd finally, for your consideration; many companies have had success by creating a dedicated schedule for bug fixing. During the development of Windows 10, Microsoft introduced \"[Bug bashing days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBeNyiazyXc)\", a day dedicated to fixing bugs, not developing any new content, where developers and dedicated members of the Windows Insider community were interactively working together to fix some of the most annoying bugs.\n\nFixing bugs in a game is like doing dishes at home. There's most likely always something more fun to do, but it's a necessity to keep everything going. Somehow, you manage to squeeze doing the dishes in your schedule. And Riot must somehow make it work to squeeze bug fixing into their content development schedule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bern","date":"2018-04-27T09:12:12.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, are 2+3 why something like the current Diana q glitches aren't yet addressed even though they feel really bad -- too hard to figure out what's causing them, so too much time down the drain better spent elsewhere?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spice POWAH","date":"2018-04-27T02:45:51.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since Riot plans on having big patch/little patch cycles, have you considered having one of the little patches dedicated entirely to bugfixes/QoL changes with easy changes like numbers if need arises?

Some were proving pretty tricky - I&#x27;ll track down where we landed on those last week. I know 1 fix for sure is going into this patch (his Q range will no longer be bugged), but there was also some weird behavioral bugs when flipping over walls he was investigating.\n> \n> Wukong ended up getting put on the backburner for a short amount of time while we re-evaluated the function/success of mini updates/roster scope updates. We&#x27;d been exploring him around the same time as the Xin Zhao rework, and there were a few lessons from that release that we wanted to learn from and apply to some of the champions like Wukong that share some similar thematic space and gameplay desire for players (we&#x27;ve seen that Wukong has a similar fantasy that Xin Zhao players and a few others share). For the time being we have him on one of our short lists for the champion team designer to pick up when they&#x27;re looking for an additional smaller scope project to take on while waiting on iterations for their main project. I can&#x27;t promise any timelines as usual, but there&#x27;s only 11 champions on that short list, so I hope that information is better than no thing. Sorry we&#x27;ve been so silent on Wukong, there just hasn&#x27;t been much to share recently that would feel particularly great, but I realize silence doesn&#x27;t feel super splendid either. FWIW I think there has to be a better passive for him, and I&#x27;d be really interested if we could make him less bound to lethality in order to be viable in a game. Right now if you can&#x27;t delete their squishies quickly, you don&#x27;t bring much to a team comp that you couldn&#x27;t get elsewhere. (Wukong has been one of my higher played champions in seasons past).\n\nIs there any possibility you could look into the Wukong bug where if you use W too soon after casting another ability you don't actually turn invisible? It's fairly easy to reproduce, just E at something and W immediately after you arrive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2018-04-26T18:24:21.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for informing me on what's going on behind the scenes.\n\nI do prefer wukong having a similar update to xin's.

I mean all champs like Riven, Camille, Renekton... can use Tiamat in their combo.  Disability of Tiamat  active really makes Tiamat become less worth buying while this item is really IMPORTANT in TOP LANE. So, we can see a lot of high elo Wu mains didn’t go Tiamat every game, just because it is not worth buying.\n\nTo be fair, if Garen can use Tiamat when he is spinning. And Garen even seldom go Hydra. So I think Wukong should be able to use Crescent (Tiamat Active).\n\nTherefore, I am sincerely hope that Riot can consider make this little change to Wukong. This will make Tiamat more worth buying on Wukong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2018-04-27T07:47:45.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I happen to lov Wukong so RIot, thak you so much.
