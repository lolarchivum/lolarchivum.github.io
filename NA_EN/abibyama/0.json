To quote you (an entire paragraph that you quoted in another board post):\n\n>Since you’ll be getting so many more shards thanks to the new leveling system (and with other recent changes to honor and events), **we’ll tune down the relative value of the essence you get from disenchanting shards of all types—champ shards, skin shards, and ward skin shards**.... To offset the disenchant rate changes, we’re going to change the way loot chests work so you’ll have a chance to get two drops in each chest. Get ready for chests inside of your chests. We’ll also add “bad luck protection,” so you won’t ever go on long streaks without getting a skin shard or a gemstone from chests.\n\nIn fact, I believe the first messages about Orange Essence specifically came from you a few days later in [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/fRZopjhE-bring-back-the-old-value-of-orange-disenchant-riot?comment=0009)\n\nIf there's another post from you specifically mentioning OE earlier than this, either on the boards or on Reddit, I couldn't find it.\n\nI hope this helps.  I do believe you tried your best to get the message out.  (Hell, I lost my internet during most of the year and I was able to hear about the Preseason changes.  However, I do believe that you weren't 100% clear about the actual nerfs to OE (purely unintentional, I'm sure).\n\n> That being said, I don&#x27;t wanna just dismiss your feedback.

Its always awesome when Rioters get on to explain and clarify.\n\nI would like to make one comment tho. I understand that Riot has to be profitable and I love that they give me a chance to earn skins without paying. But the changes to Orange essence and not being able to combine champ shards to get a permanent feels really bad. Since the Preseason changes it feels way harder to get skin shards. It feels harder to get chests, and almost every chest I have opened contained a champ shard. As a player who already has every champion it feels irritating to get a champ shard which provides no real value to me. I guess what I am trying to say it that the system felt better and more rewarding before these changes.\n\nI mean it doesn't feel awesome only earning 50 Blue Essence for a first win and then nothing else until I Level up and  have to harvest BE from whatever skin shards I randomly got. It would feel much more natural to get a little XP and BE every match. But I understand that it is more directed to new players that are working towards acquiring champions.
