I feel like the Runeterra =/= Earth is kinda a bad argument there.\n\nIf you're gonna base skins off of real world concepts though, then people are gonna constantly point that out. Project is unlike anything today so people talk about symbolizm in the stories and how cool their world is because it's unique and they focus on the unquieness. Not like High Noon where they are very up front on how it's mid-western american themed and doesn't stand much on it's own if you don't understand the base line of that already. It assumes you just understand because of the years of it being engrained in us. This does kinda cause a \"I don't get it\" though in other cultures much like how people recently didn't understand what K/DA was even supposed to be because they just never listen to K-Pop and aren't super big anime fans so they don't understand that culture.\n\nThese skins aren't set in the real world but they are influcened by the real world so saying stuff like \"Runeterra =/= Earth\" doesn't work to well, especially now since K/DA exists as a universe in the real world and also in pretty much ever other Universe like Odyessy and Star Guardian.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2019-10-29T19:57:04.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whether Runeterra is Earth or not does not matter to the certain group of people who get offended VERY easily.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason why Riot would want to start drama concerning \"racism\" as those articles and social media birds will no doubt claim it to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Crescent Dusk","date":"2019-10-29T02:13:24.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ProExpertKing,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=xznoKLfq,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2019-10-28T20:53:51.406+0000)\n>\n> It's not really high noon if they're modled after native americans, especially when their colors and designs suggest more northern tribes (even if the amount of \"clothes\" don't)\n> \n> I find it unlikely riot will make native americans especially people freaked out when Phara was given a native american skin when she IS native american.\n\nCould have sworn Phara was Egyptian ;x.
