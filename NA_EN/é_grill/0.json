There are two primary reasons why a patch can fail at this point:\n\n1. There are permission issues with files being properly opened on your computer, or certain files are corrupted.\n2. Your computer is unable to properly connect to our Servers to identify what files are needed or cannot be downloaded.\n\nBecause of this, make sure to try the steps in this discussion:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/zPUA7Zyg-new-having-issues-patching-416-click-here\n\nThe steps here will commonly resolve the majority of issues with the patcher failing.  If you have tried the steps in these guides, and you are still unable to see the much desired Log-in Screen, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us here in Player Support!
