The thing is that she's been out for a reasonable amount of time now. With the nerfs from pbe not out yet, she has few counters in and out of lane. Her e range, cooldown, and general lack of counterplay (when combined with the aoe, low cooldown, heavy burst of her q)  is similar in power to the old taric-urgot point and click bot lane- in one champion. Obviously she requires some level of competence with skillshots, though again the lack of counterplay is the key factor.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-02-09T07:26:15.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"She has quite a bit of counterplay.

Assassins generally get complained about for a long while.\n\nYou seem to be referencing low skill play rather than high mmr-pro play. I assure you that last hitting isn't an issue in higher tiers of play. Neither is having someone come into your lane and force your enemy's summoners. While we're at it- her waveclear in lane and poke that giver her lane dominance by default, combined with proper positioning and vision control also rule out the possibility of dying magically to a gank. \n\nOn the possibility her e has clunterplay: No. The sheer distance posibilities on an uncleansable disable is not interactive. You say the enemy has time to react to the sleep once they're hit? So you want them to flash away, use any mobility spell, and use a nonexistent item immunity so they can't be hit by zoe's r-q-q-flash combo?

Gp and riven aren&#x27;t overpowered at this point in time.\n\nIm honestly astonished you all still don't get it.\n\nStatistically speaking riven and gp are more broken than zoe. That's my entire point. People say she's high skill cap and difficult so she shouldn't have a high winrate, well gp and riven both are high skillcap, most would say higher, and they have HIGHER winrates than zoe and are statistically superior.","replies":[{"poster":"AmenPerson","date":"2018-02-09T09:53:38.669+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly I say it's hard to calculate how strong she could be, considering she has a ~70% ban rate. \n\nWhich means that ~30% of games she has a chance to be picked, and even then she's not a 100% pick for that ~30%, as she's actually got a ~7% pick rate. \n\nAnd then even with that ~7%, she's only winning in 50% of those games. \n\nSince she's banned so much, not a lot of people are able to get to her, so we cannot see the actual value of her win rate. It would be a lot easier to figure out how strong she was, if say she had a ban rate of ~45% and a play rate of ~15%.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-02-09T07:09:01.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"While i agree people are QQing instead of learning to play against her and shes clearly not overpowered, most of these changes bring her in line more consistently to other things, such as CC effects and removal of them. \n\nChances are she will end up being buffed later when people learn to play instead of blindly QQing, but these at least affect her frustrating bits without really hitting her strengths, so when shes later eventually buffed people arent QQing constantly.","replies":[{"poster":"ShaolinToilet","date":"2018-02-09T08:04:48.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"She might get buffed but she is pretty much the new yasuo of the boards except when you play vs her correctly she isn't even frustrating","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-02-09T10:08:01.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Pretty much.
