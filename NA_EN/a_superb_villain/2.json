In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).&quot;\n\nComparing the basic understanding of hedonism to Illaoi&#039;s quotes draws interesting parallels, if not outright reflection.\n\n&gt; If I hate something, I destroy it. If I want something, I take it.\n&gt; We are born knowing what to do. We must only act.\n&gt; It is terrible to be satisfied. The world needs us to chase dreams.\n&gt; Life is the sweetness of fruit, and the joy of battle!\n&gt; Chase what is desired.\n&gt; Honour? Duty? Ha! What your heart demands is all that matters.\n&gt; Good? Evil? Why should we care for such things?\n&gt; No love is impossible, my god demands you follow your desires.\n&gt; Live your life, chase what you desire, what else matters?\n&gt; Even if I die, I die in motion.\n\nTaking her words at face value, Illaoi seems to fall under the category of Folk Hedonism, &quot;a person who seeks out pleasure for themselves without any particular regard for their own future well-being or for the well-being of others.&quot;\n\nNothing terribly important, but I thought it was interesting; hedonists aren&#039;t frequently represented or explored in popular media.\n\nEdit:\nOne more interesting note is the etymology behind Nagakabouros' name. \"Naga\" comes from Hindu mythology and are entities which embody both human and serpent traits. \"bouros\" seems to reference Ouroboros, the tail-devouring snake, an icon that reflects the concept of  an eternal return, similar to rebirth. Some of the earliest incarnations of this icon can be found in Hindu mythology as well, such as the animal halo that surrounds Shiva who represents the duality of creation and destruction. In addition to this, modern interpretations of Ouroboros occasionally involve the idea of self-destructive activity.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-11-19T05:15:22.642+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"She always reminded me a little bit of a more martial version of the Sensates from Planescape, personally.

The Planescape setting is a multiverse setting for D&D with many many planes of existence with their own rules and peoples etc - but some say at the heart of these multiverses is the magical city of Sigil.  Sigil, the city of doors, holds portals to all planes and is a crossroads to many of these places - it's a hodgepodge of peoples and cultures.  Ruling the city, was the Lady of Pain, but more practically, there are many factions that hold territory and influence within the city.  Two of those factions (copied from the Wiki) were:\n\n>**Society of Sensation**\n>(\"Sensates\"), who believe that accumulating experiential knowledge through the senses is the only way to achieve enlightenment. Their headquarters is the Civic Festhall, which features an endless series of entertainments and a library of magically stored experiences. They are remniscent of ancient Epicurianism, as well as the more modern empiricism.\n\nand \n\n>**Transcendent Order**\n>(\"Ciphers\"), who believe that by tapping in to the 'cadence' of the planes and acting through pure instinct they can achieve a higher state of being. Their headquarters is the Great Gymnasium, where members can train to improve their bodies and minds. Their philosophy could be considered similar to Taoism and Zen Buddhism.\n\nGreat setting, Planescape, and adds a big dollop of weird to any D&D game you might want to run.","replies":[{"poster":"Sincarnation","date":"2015-11-19T17:37:22.868+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=OBwXYfqq,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-11-19T16:10:14.545+0000)\n>\n> No problem, and excellent gif.\n> \n> Planescape is a D&D setting, probably most famously used in the (awesome) Planescape: Torment CRPG from Black Isle.

I am having difficulty seeing it as a manner of living through instinct and avoidance of strict moral codes when doing so requires a conscious decision on her part, and in a sense her commandments of living without doctrines or laws is in itself a doctrine. Hedonism is not exactly what she practices, but it is the closest real world equivalent that approaches the defining qualities of her belief.\n\nTake Karthus, for example, he wanted to become the lich we know as today, yet his actions would conflict with her understanding of \"motion\" or the natural way of life.
