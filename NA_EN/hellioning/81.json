Plz Rito, don't make Mundo serious and not just brain damaged loveable crazy man.\n\nYou're remembering wrong.\n\nFirst, Dr. Mundo is not braindamaged. His oversized tongue causes massive speech impediments and he adopted his dialogue while in \"Mundo\" form. Kreuben Edmundo can leave Mundo form, but tends not to because he believes he represents Zaunite pride (If I'm remembering the JoJ interview correctly). He is as much as a genious as the hulking behemoth as he is as a frail, puny human.\n\nSecond, Kreuben Edmundo was born a cruel, twisted man. At age seven, no pets near his house survived. At age twelve, he KILLED HIS OWN PARENTS in an experiment and asked for emantipation. Even Zaun is mostly disgusted with his experiments, and the only reason he isn't lynched is because he is a huge scientific asset for both Zaun and Noxus. \n\n\"He continues his experiments to this day, even using himself as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his disfigured appearance and his... unique manner of speaking. There are rumors that the High Command in Noxus has given him free reign to pursue his life's work in his spare time.\"\n\nStraight from his lore. Also: \"Beware the Madman of Zaun, for in his eyes you are already dead\".\n\n\nDr. Mundo is NOT a joke character, he is NOT a goofy madman. He is a highly intelligent, calculating man that has as big of a kill list as Singed. Unless you find patricide, immoral experiments, sociopathy and a complete disregard for human life besides how entertaining and scientifically enlightening it is to see how a being reacts to having 50% of his bones crushed by huge, uncaring hands, the last thing DOCTOR Mundo is is loveable.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-08-09T16:53:20.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did reference his monstrous behavior as a child when stating he didn't quite match Jekyll and Hyde because he was a monster before becoming one.

His in game representation does certainly contradict this (ie mundo say his own name a lot or else he forget it), but that is my point. I like the bumbling monster more than the vicious sociopath. I don't want to play a champ who would prefer to kill his teammates if they do poorly. That is a champ who would literally be expected to be toxic and experiment with the suffering of people whom he didn't find useful.\n\nThe direct conflict between bumbling monster who took his experiments on himself too far, and a cold calculating monster who finds experimental use in the suffering of his subjects, is so conflicting that you cannot really preserve both if you rework it and make a consistent lore theme. The problem is one group of people will like each side and it can be painful to be on the side who has one of their favorite champs deleted.

I mentioned over on Factions that most of his new lines (especially post-\"death\") fall into the category of \"I'LL [do bad thing] TO YOUR [body part]!\"  And, yeah, that was always his persona in the Lore, but pretty much all exposure to Gangplank came from gameplay.  As far as I can remember, Gangplank's only appearance in the lore aside from his own biography (Unless you want to count MF's mother's murder retroactively) before Burning Tides was in the JoJ article about a drinking contest with MF.  So I was, despite being a big lore fan, always associating Gangplank with \"Yo ho ho...and a bottle of.....RUM!\"  And while his new VA is certainly a better fit for his Lore character, I just had more fun listening to the old one.\n\nAnd yeah, League is an inherently silly environment.  It has to be remembered that this is a universe where a hamster man flies a helicopter and a chaingun/spatula wielding manatee existed before being murdered by a werewolf.  That doesn't stop some dark stuff from being possible and good variety, but the balance is a very important thing to watch.\n\nI think the champions most at risk of getting this treatment are these:\n{{champion:8}} You already brought him up.

Riot has basically admitted this already. At least we'll get to see how 'SUPER DUPER SERIOUS' Riot is now, without any of the 'stupid kids stuff'\n> \n> {{champion:45}} Will be preserved because he's a Yordle, and those are the only things allowed to be silly anymore (besides the random mutant)\n> \n> {{champion:44}} Will have no quotable lines at all, and will certainly lose his joke (it's not serious or forgettable enough). I doubt he'll be super dark (there was a long Riot-led post asking what players liked about Taric), but he'll certainly be boring, like every other champion personality Riot has released since JInx ({{champion:41}} , {{champion:245}} , {{champion:429}} , {{champion:14}} ). Except for {{champion:223}} , that was a pretty good VO. \n> \n> Riot is trying really hard to make League super dark and serious, like a 14-year-old wearing his Slipknot t-shirts and dying his hair black to show how cool he is. Don't expect any more 'fun' things that aren't sterilized to death\n\n#Graham Mcneill is writing for Riot Games now....\n\nHe worked on **Warhammer 40,000** for _Games Workshop._\n\nThey invented Grimdark.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimdark\nhttp://knowyourmeme.com/memes/grimdark\nhttp://1d4chan.org/wiki/Grimdark\n\n#In the Grim Darkness of the future...\n\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/0/0e/Warhammer-fantasy-roleplay_1024x768_12041.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121203040653\n\nThe thing to remember though, is that even 40,000 has comedy. WH40K has Orks which are both  grimdark and hilarious. Some people see the grimdarkness as black comedy itself, because things are taken to such ridiculous levels and extremes that you have to laugh at them. Plenty of fanart appreciates this humor.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-08-08T03:23:28.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would be happy to see black humor; it would add personality.

Apart from the hulk, he's also a genius doctor but also a mass murderer (mostly for research reasons).
