Tear->Archangel's forces different attention in that 'if youre out of mana, you recall, end of story', rather than hanging around for regeneration. Not bad per say, but different.\n\nMana management is crucial to Syndra's tempo and making sure she has highs and lows, so a recovery mechanic makes me very leery. The proposed one above, for instance, would give a hefty amount of 'win more' in mana the more she kept fighting. At 400 damage on one hit, FoW breaks even with itself, anymore is a massive net gain of mana. So Syndra is, with any one mana item, at leisure to keep throwing out Qs and Ws all day without much concern for mana management (ala the old Ziggs and Xerath problems).\n\nIf you wanted to look at her in this area, I'd look at the base mana cost of Force of Will first before introducing a mana recovery mechanic anywhere in her kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrobob4","date":"2015-08-22T01:11:14.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, I'm not a syndra player, but hear me out... (always a solid way to start a post)\n\nWhat if the mana cost depends on how long you hold the target? For example, maybe quick casting costs a moderate amount of mana, but holding it for a full duration reduces the mana cost to almost nothing. Dare I suggest that holding it for long enough could even refund mana? \n\nThematically, I see this as Syndra sort of draining the essence from her captured target. With that in mind, it could even be that grabbing an orb does nothing to the mana cost, but grabbing an enemy does (since orbs might not have an essence to steal from).\n\n[I just got an insane idea that holding an enemy could restore HP... Should we even entertain that idea? Syndra with sustain?]\n\nOr go the other way. Quick casting costs little mana, and does less damage. Holding it charges it up to full strength, dealing puns of damage, but costing much more mana. Think Janna's Q.\n\nI feel like scaling the spell on the duration held has lots of potential, and shouldnt change Syndras 'feel' much if any. Not just mana, but damage, the slow strength or duration, the AoE radius, and even cast range could all scale this way. Leaving plenty of room for balance, and giving the ability tons of potential variety. Does Syndra need help with mana? Scale the mana cost. Does she need damage but you want it to be situational? increase the damage the longer she holds it.  Do you want her to have a longer range ability? Probably not, but you could scale the cast range if you did.\n\nIf you tie this scaling into her passive, I could even see a crazy world in which it is balanced in a way that Syndra players might have a reason to max W first...\n\nScaling off duration seems like an amazing opportunity that, now that I am thinking about it, I am rather surprised you guys haven't capitalized on yet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-08-21T04:44:06.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Isn't way too strong (we did try putting the knockup that was there prerelease back on, felt great as the Syndra player but adding another hard CC wasn't appropriate).\n\nMaybe hard to thematically tie, but how about a snare?

Think: Heimer's upgraded grenade **\n\nPros:\n\n- Helps Syndra to poke and seige a little more lategame, but not such that it's a spammable, annoying manoeuvre, as she has to cast two spells to make it occur and is gated by W's cooldown, like Jayce for example.\n\n- Also thematically fairly cool, ESPECIALLY if you make a little drag effect in the ground like Gnar's thrown boulder.

The more she places, the easier she can land a stun - i.e pre teamfight, placing 3 and then shooting all 3 with E gives you a chance to stun up to 3 people in different places. \n\nStunning you means she can unload everything upon you. That's her wet dream. After she unloads her burst she's left with this pokey playstyle of back and forth Q and Ws until her E comes off cooldown.\n\nSo the proposed slow zone not only enforces the GET OUT OF THE BALL FIELD feeling/thinking but it allows for more counterplay. You are encouraged to get out of it to stop the slow and tenacity isn't the boring only counter to the slow.\n\nEdit: I thought about this for a while and thought that if the W slow was ONLY a slow zone at rank 5, it would feel weird having it a direct slow applied for X seconds and then switched to a dodge-able slow zone.

That way, you can choose between E or Q depending on what you want to do in the match and, since that wouldn't increase damage or slow %, that makes maxing W the \"defensive\" option whereas E is the offensive one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2015-08-21T10:31:20.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always thought of Syndra as a lane bully that evolves into a control / pick style assassin. She operates outside of the other team's range, poking with Q and seeking an opportunity for a long-range stun to set up an all-in kill with her ult.\n\nSo I'll throw some (probably wild) ideas out:\n\n1. Picking up a ball leaves a copy of the original ball on the ground. This means W would create an extra ball. This would have ramifications for all of her abilities as well as any play style you prefer.\n2. Tossing a ball at a location leaves a zone behind that slows targets inside. This would add a little to her control aspect to help her in a meta of Righteous Glory meatballs running at limited-mobility champions. The zone could optionally be tuned to benefit allies within.\n3. *Directly hitting* a target refunds either half the mana cost or 1-2 seconds on the cooldown, and grants Syndra a small buff  for a duration (examples: 1% movement speed, range, CDR, mana, shield, resists), stacking up to X times. This encourages players to role play Syndra's theme as a telekinetic mage who tosses targets around. I want to see Syndra flinging targets around her like Jean Grey in X-Men with the Phoenix Force.  You could even lower the damage of consecutive strikes on a target to accommodate her power budget.\n4. Vision is granted in a range around the landing area of W. This would allow Syndra to \"face check\" bushes safely at range, and help her as a pick mage who works around vision to set up a pick.  The vision could even last for a small duration (the ball could have a red swirl animation around it to indicate it's \"vision-empowered.\")\n5. Balls lifted by W gain increased size. This could increase the target area of her W as well as reliability of E (Make E's bonus increased range rather than width?) Not a big fan of intruding on E's design space, but I'm trying to think of ways to enhance her role at setting up picks. I suppose the first suggestion of creating ball copies would also help by giving her ult more damage to pick a target off.\n\nReferencing the 3rd suggestion, something absolutely crazy would be to lower W's cooldown+mana cost *on direct hits* (ie. a small circle within the larger target area ala Zilean's bomb), but add a debuff that makes consecutive W hits deal zero damage for a duration. The reduced cooldown/mana cost means Syndra would be spamming W for the utility to kite/chase until she finally misses a direct hit (or the opponent dodges). There would be a lot of flying minions/balls around Syndra, which could be cool, and the action-packed mechanics might appeal to players in love with that mechanical ceiling of Syndra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eddyward","date":"2015-08-21T09:17:20.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking to augment Force of Will by making it feel like an _upgraded_ version, how about making it leave a brief slowing field that matches the max rank slow (currently 45%)? \"The impact of the throw causes a gravity field to form in its wake.\" The \"clear niche\" here would be to give her the ability to zone with her W. \n\nIt would still act as \"multi-target peel\" in a way, but the ability itself already does that. The key is that this adds the functionality of her not having to hit someone with the ability to make an impact. This is similar to how she'll throw spheres on the ground (without hitting an enemy) simply to set up her E or her ult. This gives her the option of setting up spheres to zone enemies as well. I think it's a safer way of re-implementing her prerelease knockup, but it kind of keeps the spirit of that. What do you think? It would require art work, so that might be a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-08-21T06:04:56.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a few ideas but there could be better ones floating around somewhere:\n\n1. ~~Larger 2nd cast radius with a knock-back from center rather than a knock-up? like a mini gragas ulti? But then again most of her spells are better fitted to keeping enemy champs clumped up for more centralized aoe damage from Q and E. It could also kinda take away Gragas' identity.~~\n2. ~~Another suggestion would be adding a third spell condition similar to Puppeteer. Those hit by W  can be pulled  closer?~~\n3. How about actually leaving some sort of area of affect domain similar to Ori's W? \n4. Ok, last suggestion. Make it so her W's internal cool down starts refreshing while she holds a sphere/object instead of after the 2nd cast. She can finally throw more sphere's around if you time the throw right before the 2nd cast time window ends. You could potentially make 7 sphere ulti's easier, better, faster, and stronger to pull off.\n\nEdit: # 1 and 2 probably don't fit your criteria :P\n\nOther than that mana issues that are present in this ability always comes up,  assuming you are not getting kills/assists left and right to rejuvenate from athenes. Idk, maybe it's a weakness that should be kept similar to Lux's E cost, Anivia Q, etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2015-08-20T20:00:03.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"What for?????
