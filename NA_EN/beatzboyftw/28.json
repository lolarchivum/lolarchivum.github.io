Could not find my old link but this one covers all the points quite nicely.\n\n>  Behavior\nMinions walk along a lane until they find an enemy unit. When they find an enemy unit, they attack it. An enemy champion can aggro the minion if they basic attack or use a targeted ability or spell on a nearby allied champion. When they find several enemy units they choose their target using a priority system that follows this order:\n1.    Enemy champions attacking an allied champion.\n2.    Enemy minions attacking an allied champion.\n3.    Enemy minions attacking an allied minion.\n4.    Enemy turrets attacking an allied minion.\n5.    Enemy champions attacking an allied minion.\n6.    The closest enemy minion.\n7.    The closest enemy champion. \nOnce a minion has chosen a target, it only switches to a new target if the new target has higher priority. If they see a new target with the same priority as their current target, they keep attacking their current target.\nMinions reevaluate their target every few seconds. For instance, if an enemy champion attacks an allied champion and then stops attacking, minions will keep targeting the enemy champion for a short time after he stops attacking.\nWhen the target of a minion leaves its sight, the minion switches to a new target or keeps advancing if there are no targets within sight. \n\nJust in case you dont feel like following the link","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JoeMG","date":"2018-06-22T16:27:15.345+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=remakoro,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Y5qtKmG3,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2018-06-22T12:28:53.757+0000)\n>\n> You just dont get it, right?\n> \n> If skillshots can be blocked by minions but u cannot then you can just stand right into minions and be completely safe from any skillshot that affects only its first target.
