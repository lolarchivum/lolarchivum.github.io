Eventually league told me to try to reconnect and every time I did it failed.

I&#039;m not using any 3rd party software except razer synapse. Riot please...\n\nIs there some sort of setting on my modem/router that would cause this after the recent patch?\n\nUpdate: Tried practice tool and same sort of deal it tries to connect forever and just fails.

We did do a check on our end to make sure that this product worked fine with our new tech, but it's possible you are using an older version. If that doesn't solve your issue, can you temporarily disable (or uninstall) your security product and let us know if that helps? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2018-06-14T16:10:22.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will like to give info as well, I am not having any problems but I am using Razer Synapse as well, software version 2.21(not the newest update) That being said I use it a bit differently then most people, I use it for my keypad ( I play league with a keypad instead of my keyboard, I use the exact keypad Magicarpusedfly does the Razer Nostromo) and as such I do not have the software run at startup(because some reason the software glitches some games) I run it when I start league or just before I get into game.\n\nThe main point of this is that I am not having problems with Razer Synapse, It could be because I am using an older version, could be because I am starting it not on start up, or/and it could be because I am using an old piece of razer hardware. Just thought this would help you out @Riot Bugcheck\n\nPS. I only tested Practice tool today(as I read this post to see if  I was affected, I did play an aram yesterday but it might have been before the Anti-cheat came out","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boomer Blitz","date":"2018-06-14T15:58:05.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't simply ending the task via task manager work if that was what was causing the issue (Razer Synapse) ? \nI don't have any anti-virus security software as it slows my pc down and I've never felt they were worth it.

However, if it doesn't fix your issue, it would be awesome if you could bring up \"msinfo32\" and export your results so that I can go over them.\n\nYou can do that by pressing Start+R (to open up the \"Run\" window), entering msinfo32, selecting the \"System Summary\" item in the left pane, navigating to \"File\", and then selecting \"Export\". You can name the file whatever you want. \n\nIt may take a few minutes to collect all your system information.

It takes about 10 minutes trying to load after champ select and then once it finally does get in the game it is running at 1 fps (laggy unplayable etc). Same as it was before. I have very little running actively when I play the game. Could it be something installed that isn't actually running? Or some sort of network issue since it is happening to my wife as well?

It's probably something running on both you and your wife's computers so targeting shared software between them is recommended. For now, I'd recommend disabling (temporarily uninstalling if necessary) the following and see if it fixes your issue (in the practice tool):\n1. Malware Bytes \n2. Proxifier\n\nIf that doesn't fix your problem, open \"msconfig\" (Start+R) and select \"Diagnostic startup\". You'll have to reboot. You can check if that fixes your issue too.\n\nPlease keep me in the loop, though. Thank you for your help in troubleshooting the problem.

You can do that by opening up Task Manager, right-clicking on the \"League of Legends.exe\" process, and selecting \"Create Dump File\".
