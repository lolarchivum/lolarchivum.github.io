You've still got armor/mr from runes and rune shards, and it will help you more overall than the measley amount of AD you'd get from a tri-force and a titanic. You act like because it's not the first item you build you don't build it at all, try to be a bit more objective and factual and cu back on the bias bub. It wouldn't be useless, as Juggernauts get usually Trinity or Cleaver and probably Sterak's (Darius and Illaoi are the two I'm really thinking about right now.) and then literally build full tank to stay alive in a team fight because they already have high base damage. Having a defensive rune scale off of damage would cause people to cry about damage because it incentivizes damage, meanwhile having defenses scale off of defenses incentivizes building tanky which would make it much harder to kill you and overall lower the amount of damage in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"BigFBear","date":"2019-02-01T01:19:22.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont say they dont build tank at all but they may build it with the second or even third item and until that half of the game is over.","replies":[{"poster":"Beast Brawler","date":"2019-02-01T18:04:26.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps, but at least it would be worse on Lissandra.

Squishy (normally ranged) champs normally have less base and natural scaling resistances, while the intended champions usually have quite a bit.  Then the intended champions usually also build more resistances on top of that.  \n\nThis combination is key: since even squishy champions have access to some pretty high resistance items.  Banshee's Veil has 65 mr, while GA has 40 armor and with boots up to 60 bonus armor, the same some fighters or jugernaughts might build.  But the difference is that those champions have MUCH higher base resistances.\n\nThe issue with this plan is that it was already tried.  On RELEASE that was actually how the rune worked.   No one took it.

Rageblade is much harder to get full stacks on, and is therefore given a crutch to help out melee users. Ranged champions could also take advantage of Knight's Vow to heal off of the damage their ADC or jungler deals without having to get close to the fight, or build full damage items, and Relic shield items would be abused by ADCs more to heal and their supports. Champions like Kog'Maw and pretty much every other ADC would abuse Conqueror by being able to constantly have bonus AD and true damage in an extended fight, and ranged champions would be able to stay much safer if they were able to land a free Grasp proc whenever they wanted for the full heal and bonus health amount.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-01-30T21:17:43.859+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":">They already suffer in base stats\n\ndo they though?\n\nAatrox:  \tHealth: 580 – 1940, Armor: 33 – 88.3 MR:  32.1 – 53.4\nAkali:  \tHealth:  550 – 1995, Armor:  23 – 82.5 MR:  32.1 – 53.4\n_Ahri:  \tHealth: 526 – 2090, Armor: 20.9 – 80.4 MR:  30 – 38.5\nAshe:  \tHealth: 539 – 1984, Armor:  26 – 83.8 MR:  30 – 38.5_\nAmumu:  Health:  \t613.1 – 2041.1, Armor: 33 – 97.6 MR:  32.1 – 53.4\n\nAsides from base ad, ranged champs barly pay in base stats compared to the **MASSIVE** advantage that range offers","replies":[{"poster":"Laurënt","date":"2019-01-30T23:03:28.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sire Hippington,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4GtGblr5,comment-id=00080001,timestamp=2019-01-30T21:17:43.859+0000)\n>\n> do they though?\n> \n> Aatrox:  \tHealth: 580 – 1940, Armor: 33 – 88.3 MR:  32.1 – 53.4\n> Akali:  \tHealth:  550 – 1995, Armor:  23 – 82.5 MR:  32.1 – 53.4\n> _Ahri:  \tHealth: 526 – 2090, Armor: 20.9 – 80.4 MR:  30 – 38.5\n> Ashe:  \tHealth: 539 – 1984, Armor:  26 – 83.8 MR:  30 – 38.5_\n> Amumu:  Health:  \t613.1 – 2041.1, Armor: 33 – 97.6 MR:  32.1 – 53.4\n> \n> Asides from base ad, ranged champs barly pay in base stats compared to the **MASSIVE** advantage that range offers\n\nYes and no.

Stats without items.\n\nNot saying this is the most effective method, but that is simply how they balance melee and ranged champions. The reason why ranged champions tend to out base-stats melee champions is that they have completely different itemization most of the time, if not always. All items that melee champions tend to build add a lot to their defensiveness with bits of offensiveness. Ranged champions get bits of defensiveness from their items, but the main stat attributes are offensive. It's difficult to simply look at base stat alone when itself was designed to go hand-in-hand with itemisation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FrozenAshe","date":"2019-01-31T06:39:19.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yeah cause picking an assassin and a champ that has a self ga and insane life steal really proves your point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shiroe Okazaki","date":"2019-01-31T07:13:54.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So that melee can actually compare to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-01-31T19:40:32.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because range is the most important BASE STAT in the game probably, rivaled by MS only.
