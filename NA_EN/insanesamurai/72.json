Most of those champs listed do not have that hard of a time fighting Camille by themselves unless she&#x27;s already got a nice lead on them, and even then they can still outplay her.\n\nNo I haven't.\n\nYes, she is one of the strongest teamfighters and one of the strongest splitpushers at the same time. Now tell me, which champion works like that other than her? \n\n> I think along this process you&#x27;re missing the entire point.  I&#x27;m not saying Camille is a garbage champion, I&#x27;m saying if she _still_ needs nerfs, then so does Lee(along with a good chunk of other champions who excel at something).\n\n*who excels at two entirely different somethings that usually do not go along\n\nI really have trouble understanding why you can't see that being able to splitpush and teamfight extremely well at the same time is mildly OP.\nI also have immense trouble understanding why you'd throw a Lee Sin (and \"a good chunk of other champions\") when they come not even close to her winrate and P&B in competetive and soloQ.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-03-23T12:06:05.994+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5OT85b0n,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-03-23T11:13:12.386+0000)\n>\n> Sure, but when other champs do this, they &#x27;wait and see what happens when people get used to them more&#x27;.

It means you have to stand there in her ult and get abused by her over power stats","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2017-03-23T12:35:53.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Does Lee's ultimate have healthy counterplay?\n\nAlso, her ult is basically a giant weird root.  Sure it lasts a long time for CC(till they nerf it), but it only blocks one champion moving, and even then not entirely.  It doesn't stop them attacking, it doesn't stop them from being able to dodge skillshots, and it doesn't reduce or prevent their damage at all.  Yes it's strong, but it's a single target assassination based ult.  Plenty of champs have them and they have similar effects.  Hell, some just kill you outright in much less time than it takes for her to chase them around the circle or follow them to the edge and sit there autoing them several times.\n\nI think people are getting too upset at \"wtf i can't flash out\" before realizing you can't flash out of a slew of ults once they've connected.  \n\nI almost feel like once Riot realized her ult ruins Lee's trolley gameplay(ohmygod something Lee can't wall jump away from!) they had to do something about it.  Course if he has his ult, he's perfectly fine, cause Lee has an answer to just about everything, even a move that counters his mobility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TricolorStar","date":"2017-03-23T11:22:19.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5OT85b0n,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-03-23T11:13:12.386+0000)\n>\n> Sure, but when other champs do this, they &#x27;wait and see what happens when people get used to them more&#x27;.
