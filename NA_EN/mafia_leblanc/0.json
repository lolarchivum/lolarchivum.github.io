Occluded spawn order rewards teams who can adapt to an in-game situation on the fly.\n\nA workable compromise, imo, would be to show the first dragon spawn during champion select. It would give some amount of pre-game planning to team comps, based on the fact that both teams know at least one type of dragon that will spawn in the game, but still tests in-game strategic flexibility by having the rest of the dragons be occluded.","replies":[{"poster":"Averia","date":"2018-10-27T05:17:55.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I both agree and disagree with this assessment. Mostly because yeah, it does remove some on-the-fly decision making... But on the other hand, on-the-fly decision making is already super simple and it's easy to have a priority set for nearly every game to begin with.\n\nKnowing the dragon's that spawn in a given game give you more options to build a comp around specific dragon spawns. This offers teams at a high level more diversity in their champion choices because they can augment the champions they pick with Dragon's, rather than just getting random Dragon buffs on already generically good champions.\n\nAn example of this is something like, picking more immobile champions if you can secure multiple Cloud Drakes, versus picking more mobile bursty champions if there are multiple Fire drakes. Or even opting into a Poke composition knowing there are multiple Ocean drakes allowing for long sieges.\n\nSo while flexibility in-game would be lowered slightly, there would be more decisions to make and more control over the game from before you even load in. **Then, this is where the in-game flexibility comes back**, it's up to both teams to determine which drakes they need and when. They can make more decisions because they know the Drakes that will spawn, and they can choose to surrender certain Drakes for objectives with more knowledge of the game-state in the future rather than just hope that certain Drakes will spawn to benefit your composition.\n\nThe drafting phase is an important part of the game and drafting around Drakes is a positive, *not* a negative play pattern. Drafting for Drakes would promote more neutral objective fights, which is good for the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xyltin","date":"2018-10-26T14:26:58.547+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"At least show the 1 drake type that won't spawn during the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mcjagger","date":"2018-10-26T20:47:15.810+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot MapleNectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VHR8WryG,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2018-10-25T23:22:29.648+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re talking about this, no decision made yet though\n\nJust a reminder that the whole point of random dragon spawns was to add in-game variance that you could adapt to based on that game.\n\nIt would be counter to the entire point if you could prepare for a whole game based on your champ and rune selections if you knew the dragon spawns. \n\nMaybe a better change is showing the dragon spawns DURING the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaisas","date":"2018-10-26T13:01:47.725+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'd consider trying out only showing maybe first or first & 2nd dragon, showing all dragons would make it a boring as a spectator imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oolong Along","date":"2018-10-27T13:39:44.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not good at the game and I don't want more avenues to be beaten.

I like it.\n\nIt's better to have to adapt on the fly and not play the same perfectly solved strategy. \n\nDragons are fine because they are _controlled_ randomness. It's a random dragon, sure, but it also spawns in the same place at a fixed timer and you know well in advance which one will spawn when you load in (3+ minutes in advance).  Basically, you're actually not adding strategy or depth to the game You're only going to cause one of two things:\n\nA.) Dragons are strong enough that your team phase is completely decided by which one spawns, meaning that you don't actually have agency in your choice but rather are forced to build around the first dragon spawn.\n\nB.) Dragons are weak/non-important enough that your draft isn't changed because picking around a dragon isn't as good as just picking a good team comp.\n\nOne situation is a balance problem, the other situation is it being a skill-problem just like how people were upset when they added jungle timers.  This solution doesn't solve any problem nor add any depth to the game. At best you're adding a non-factor which is completely arbitrary. At worst you're completely dictating the picks in the game because a dragon is so powerful it can decide a game. Which is the exact sort of thing players are usually against. \n\nPoint is, Riot added random spawns so you don't just do the same thing literally every single game and have to adapt on the fly. This would completely remove that and add the binary choice of \"Build team around dragon if it good dragon\" or \"Completely ignore dragon because it doesn't matter\".\n\nEDIT: Also this would mean your team can/will yell at champion picks. Why are you not picking an early game champ when the Infernal spawns first? Why are you not picking early game lane-winner bot lane when a mountain is spawning? Y'know. That thing boards _heavily_ criticizes Riot about in \"you have to pick meta champs\".","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-10-24T19:59:00.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"one way it may add strategic depth: \nteam 1- 3 infernals spawing? pick jhin and veigar and rengar\nteam 2- 3 infernals spawning? they're probably picking jhin and veig and ren, so we can have some heavy tanks and they can't pick vayne to punish us.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-10-25T00:26:17.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really.

If you know what dragon will always spawn, you have 1-2 options early game. You either go the route that prioritizes drags or you don't. \"But what about in the game currently\" you say? Well, you can't build a comp around it so you can't set your path in stone. Maybe a valuable drag spawns but you don't have the bot lane superiority to take it.\n\nBut at the end of the day: You're asking for another out-of-game system to dictate in-game interactions (And yes, I consider pre-fight drafting a very out of game system).

Isn't this what OP was trying to achieve with this idea? You can also pick comps that enable your team or disable the other team from doing something. Maybe don't let the enemy team pick up Rengar and Jhin if you see 3 infernals on the table. Stuff like that? Prioritize Jayce if you see 3 oceans. This would really help people think for themselves instead of the same 10 champs are good for every game versus this idea where a whole roster of champs suddenly can have priority based on the different types of Drags that are on the table. This change could shatter the Meta as we know it. \n\n\nOr know that they're going to pick something like that and pick something that counters like a Noc to make the Jhin ulti useless.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-10-24T16:52:22.414+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Went over it in the above post but TL;DR Either dragons will be so strong that you're forced to pick around them (The 5-7 champs who abuse that dragon buff the most) or weak enough that it's better to go with what's strong in the meta rather than picking a team around dragon. \n\nEither way you're not actually adding more strategy, you're stifling it.

I think you made some valid points for sure. \n\n\"Dragons are strong enough that your team phase is completely decided by which one spawns, meaning that you don't actually have agency in your choice but rather are forced to build around the first dragon spawn.\"\n\nIf dragons are strong then there will definitely be an emphasis on stronger early champs but I think theres a lot of room for what qualifies as \"strong early\", maybe we'll see champs that can push lanes hard to get priority, maybe we'll get champs that are strong at dueling, others that prioritize CC for skirmishes. \n\nAlso getting first dragon =/= getting the next 4. So yes you might secure the first one, but it doesn't mean you're gonna get the next one, if anything you're likely to not get it with the ancient skin passive or whatever its called everytime you kill a dragon you do less damage to it? I'm not sure if that's still a thing, but my point stands. \n\nBut your second point is the one I kinda take issue with, \n\n\"Dragons are weak/non-important enough that your draft isn't changed because picking around a dragon isn't as good as just picking a good team comp.\"\n\nBut then if thats the case then this isn't really different from our current meta. Theres no harm (that I can forsee) in this case. \n\nWell the more I think about it, I think that it still adds quite a bit of diversity to the game. Even if like you said it brings about 5-7 champs that can abuse the dragons, for each drag that could be 20 - 28 champions that might be prioritized SOLELY for abusing drake power, but that number doesn't include for champions that don't abuse the drakes but rather are used to shut down the said picks with their own unique abilities. \n\nFor example: 3 Clouds might mean Nunu, Rakan, Sion, Karma and Sivir \nare\nprioritized but if you pick a team with a lot of global presence like TF and Shen you can sorta nullify the enemy team advantages of being able to just run at you with 3 drakes by also being able to match their engage with your own people or maybe you'll pick a Gragas and Janna to disengage their engage, or maybe you'll pick an Amumu, Ziggs and Varus and see if they even wanna try running into you in a team fight.  There's so much potential for unique strategies and a whole bunch of different champions to be used. So maybe this opens the door for even more champions that do not abuse the dragons.\n\n\" Also this would mean your team can/will yell at champion picks. Why are you not picking an early game champ when the Infernal spawns first? Why are you not picking early game lane-winner bot lane when a mountain is spawning? Y'know. That thing boards heavily criticizes Riot about in \"you have to pick meta champs\". \"\n\nMaybe we could do something about this, what if we made it so that it was only available in flex que, and/or elo tiered. If teams have an understanding of how the games work at a certain level of play it doesn't make sense to take this feature away from them. But its only a suggestion before the pitchforks come out.\n\nEither way, it might be a solution to make pro play more interesting too, instead of Urgot , Aatrox and Kai Sa every game because they're just good. \n\nI'm at work so the response isn't well written but I hope you get the gist of the ideas here!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2018-10-24T05:10:22.184+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't really like this a whole lot, and Riot's said some of the reasons it might not be the best idea before I believe.\n\nLike if you see three Infernals will spawn in-game and you're trying to play someone who doesn't scale super hard into late, maybe people will try and force you off that pick.\n\nI'd be cool with maybe the first drake being shown.
