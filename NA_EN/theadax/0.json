He really just doesn't seem to fit the theme of a \"Tiny master of Evil\", what with his laning being so horrendous, and I think that's by and large because of his E. You guys fixed him back in 5.4 because Support Veigar was getting a lot of play on the pro level (and he was a sleeper op for years with his instant AoE stun on the E) and one of the main changes you did was put a delay on his Event Horizon. This is all well and fine, but it got tweaked such that it is even stronger than it was in teamfights because it can stop dashes, but next to useless in the laning phase. With his E so strong, Riot can't possibly justify adding power to the other parts of his kit. So now his Q is also a skill-shot to decrease the reliability. Combined with his Q now being a line skill-shot, it's also blocked by 2 minions, and his W with a 1.25 second delay, Veigar is the one of the worst champs in the game from a solo-lane aspect, on par with Soraka after her rework. Certainly the worst laning for a mage designed for the solo-lane role. And the thing is, before the rework he could actually lane somewhat decently. There really hasn't been a champ whose core play changed so much since the nerfs of S2 Diana/Olaf. It's not about the win-rate, it's about being able to play him without having to play a bitch in lane and through the mid-game. Katarina, whose win-rate is abysmal currently because she now takes a ton of skill, still feels really good to lane with because she can at least trade with her Q. I get that pre-5.4 Veigar will likely never exist, and that's fine. I just want a tiny master of evil who feels evil, not who feels almost non-existent until it's time to teamfight. I have a few suggestions on actual ways to help balance him, and I'm hoping you'll hear me out.\n\nI'll start with the biggest offender of Viegar's kit, his E. \n\n***Event Horizon:*** This has to be tuned down considerably to be made usable in a 1v1 and still feel decent for both Veigar and his opponent. Right now it feels like crap to Veigar in lane because it's near impossible to catch a single opponent, and you can't even use it as a quick getaway anymore. For starters, it should no longer stop dashes, but apply the stun on the end like it used to. I'd also recommend either having the duration of the stun be 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 or bringing the range back. The second part is most important: it absolutely cannot give the EXACT location where it will land. Veigar cannot even get picks from fog of war with his E in the same way you can get a Morg Q or land a Sej ult. So, his E needs to be a skill-shot with a path. Think of it as traveling in the same way Lux's E does, just a bit slower (1000 speed instead of 1300). Enemies will be able to see the E coming and react, but it can also be cast from fog of war for better effectiveness (which currently cannot happen as the warning particles give the same length of warning regardless). They'll know the general area to avoid, but it's not going to be screaming \"DON'T STEP HERE AND YOU'RE FINE\" like live. Veigar will be able to use it more quickly when playing defensively (casting on top of himself) or when trying to move in close (putting himself at more risk) to try to better get it off on his enemies. The delay will take longer the farther the range he hopes to use it at, giving the enemy more time to react. This way, when it's dodged you don't feel like \"of course they'll dodge it they see right were it'll be\" but when it hits you won't get the \"That was fucking bullshit\" like you used to with pre-rework Veigar (well, you won't get it as much. It'll feel like you were outplayed, more than complete BS). \n\n***Baleful Strike (Q):*** This would be Veigar's second biggest offender. On it's own it's not bad, but it's the infinite scaling mini-game which makes it tricky to balance. Pre-5.4 you could use it to harass or CS to increase your AP, but not both. After the change to a skill shot, it was limited to killing 2 units so that Veigar couldn't farm 6 AP per wave in the mid-late game. But this also crippled his ability to deal with enemies early. While his Q does 230+60% of his AP to 2 targets, Syndra can deal 230+75%AP to anything in the area of her sphere, Lux's E has 10 more base damage and the same scaling, but damages everyone in a large AoE. Lissandra, Ziggs, Ahri, Anivia, Viktor, the list of mages with skill-shots dealing the same (or better) base damage and scaling to ALL enemies in the area they hit (whether a line like Lissandra and Viktor or a sphere like Ziggs and Syndra). They're not limited to dealing damage to just 2 targets unless there's another powerful aspect to them, such as Lux's Q with  it's snare. So we have to fix Veigar's Q as well. There are a few ways to do this.\n\n**#1)** Baleful strike only grants a stack of Phenominal Evil on the first unit it kills. It is no longer limited to only targeting 2 units. \n\nThis version keeps Viegar more in line with how Riot wanted the rework to go (skill-shot) and gives him a lot less potential to farm AP massively early (removing potential abuse of flat stacking AP runes and AFK farming waves for 5-10 minutes). It also improves his ability to lane by both adding wave clear and a more reliable damage source, as you can no longer sit behind your melee minions to zone him (you'll actually have to dodge). Stacks of Phenominal Evil can still be gained by damaging enemy champions with his Q. In this version his team fight and 1v1 potential are strongest but require the most skill and he can be outplayed more easily.\n\n**#2)** Baleful strike no longer grants a stack of Phenominal Evil upon hitting an enemy champion, unless that champion is killed (still grants stacks on minions/monsters). It is now a targeted spell again with a range of 525 (the range of his auto-attack, so in this way it works the same as Annie's Q). The cooldown and base damages have been reverted to 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 and 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260. \n\nBasically, he get's his old Q back (minus 125 range) but it cannot grant AP stacks on hitting champions like his W/E/R can. He again has to decide whether he needs to farm AP or trade with his Q, but he cannot possibly do both at the same time. In this version his 1v1 and teamfight are more reliable, but he doesn't carry the same damage potential to multiple targets as before. \n\n***Dark Matter (W):*** With tweaks to the rest of his kit, this spell probably doesn't need to be touched. \n\n***Primordial Burst (R)*** It feels rather weak now because it's an execute, and because Veigar can't land any reliable damage to have the threat of that execute. As much as I'd like to put some more umph back into it (I really liked the flat 120% AP with 80% enemy AP) I think this also would need to remain untouched until the Q and E changes were examined. With being able to get damage off more reliably, it might even be a tad strong, who knows?\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR Veigar's Q and E are the biggest problems with balancing his kit, and need to be reworked so he can better fit his theme as a master of evil. \n\nEvent Horizon (E) is now a skill shot like Lux's E (but slower) however it no longer stops dashes and the stun time is reduced. \n\nVeigar's Q doesn't have a huge CC effect like Morgana and Lux, nor massive nuke potential like Nidalee and Jayce (ranged). It is currently limited in targets it can hit because being able to reliably Q a wave for 6 AP every time is beyond broken. Therefore Q should be reworked in 1 of 2 ways:\n\n1) It remains a skill shot and travels through all units in its path, but only grants AP on the first unit killed\n2) It is reverted to the exact stats of his pre-rework Q, except it's range matches his auto-attack range. It no longer grants stacks of Phenominal Evil when dealing damage to champions because it is a targeted ability like Annie's Q (though he still gets stacks if they're killed by it).","replies":[{"poster":"Aizeroth","date":"2016-11-29T17:50:26.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't post this here , instead make your own thread in the forums if you want to talk about Veigar.\nAlso you are wrong about Veigar being weak.

And if you read my post, it's not about Veigar being weak, it's about his solo laning being ridiculously weak. Winrates are by no means indicative of champion strength. Azir was sitting as something like a 48% win-rate while being a near perma-ban because of how strong he was. Kassadin in S3 was much the same, low-ish win rate because he was a hard champ to play and many people couldn't, but almost literally cancer at the highest elos and a perma-ban for the majority of a season. Veigar is kind of the opposite, in that he's not terribly difficult to play, and his E is ridiculously strong. So strong in fact, that despite being a poor matchup into almost every champ in the game (where the absolute best you can hope to do in a 1v1 situation is farm until the enemy makes a mistake) his E will carry teamfights in the mid-late game. Veigar's actually got a 50%+ winrate this patch (6.23) but it is largely in part due to longer average game times and somewhat because of the quick level 3 junglers are able to get. After 2 camps, a level 3 jungler needs only to wait for Veigar to be level 2 to force sums in mid and quite often get the kill on the unsuspecting laner. \n\nWhat I am saying, if you pay attention as you read the post, is that because his E is so strong his laning is forced to be absolutely terrible. Furthermore, he doesn't feel like a tiny master of evil when his evil plan is \"let me sit back and try to survive this\". To remedy this, his E needs to be weaker and power needs to be shifted to his Q, allowing him to do *reliable* damage (and THAT is the key word, Veigar's damage is strong, but extremely unreliable) while not feeling like absolute BS as he did before when you could E-W-Q-R and they 100% die, no exceptions. \n\n----\n\nAdditionally,  you very much can compare champion abilities directly, you just need to make sure you take into account the rest of their kits. Veigar's Q used to be targeted, just like Annie. They BOTH have an AoE stun, they BOTH do a ton of burst. It's a comparison of mandarin oranges to tangerines. Also, I don't know what lissandra you've been playing, but her laning is far stronger than Veigar's. In the worst of matchups, her Q is low enough cooldown that she can clear wave and roam or B. Her W and E both keep her safe from being engaged on (as does her R when she gets it) and can also be used to waveclear. Oh, and once she's 6+ and has 1-2 items, she can *RELIABLY* destroy enemy squishies that haven't been ridiculously feed. She might not have the best synergy with meta champs at the moment, but her laning is far better than Veigar's. Veigar is able to do well in lane ONLY if his opponent is retarded (doesn't dodge W or E, doesn't stand behind minions when harassing, allowing Veigar to get Q's off) or if his jungler helps out. In a 2v1 or 2v2 Veigar's E is ridiculous, and they'll burn sums or outright win most of the time. In a 1v1, which he NEEDS to be able to perform in to fit his champion theme, Veigar is better than maybe Soraka and Janna... unless they go AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Aizeroth","date":"2016-11-30T13:47:53.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"In a 1v1, which he NEEDS to be able to perform in to fit his champion theme, Veigar is better than maybe Soraka and Janna... unless they go AD.\"\n\nThat is YOUR away of viewing what theme fits a tiny master of evil and NOT everyone's.

Some champions (Cassiopeia, Malzahar) destroyed him regardless. Against most he could do okay. He'd be able to choose between poking them and farming AP, and his E-W-Q combo was ALWAYS a threat. Against most melee champions (except maybe Fizz) he was even a solid counter pick. LeBlanc retains her ability to be a lane bully, albeit with a bit of a delay. Her instant burst was toned down in favor of more (though delayed) burst. Her playstyle remains the same, with the only MAJOR differences being the RR clone and not being able to instantly W-Q-R-E someone to death in under a second.

If you can land Lux's E, you can land that same version of Veigar's to at least trap them inside (as is more common now). Additionally, Veigar wouldn't have to play bitch in lane. He'd still have bad matchups, ya, but he'd be able to actually stand a chance in a 1v1 by *outplaying* his opponent, vs having his opponent fk up and walk into a stun which they have adequate warning for. \n\n> That is YOUR away of viewing what theme fits a tiny master of evil and NOT everyone's.

Veigar ***ALWAYS*** retained the ridiculous threat of late game terror, still does. In fact, I never said he was weak as a whole, just that his laning phase was trash and basically the weakest in the game. It's unquestionably far more evil to maintain both a threat in the lane AND in the late-game. Before his rework, playing against Veigar was calculating how to play around his cooldowns. You see him Q farm, go in and harass him. He might get an E-W off, but no big damage, and next time he Q's a minion you can chunk him down more. It was being stuck between a rock and a hard place: you didn't want him to scale infinitely, but you had to be cautious about going in because you might get chunked and you don't wanna give him a free lane either. Now, you still gotta beware the late game, but early you laugh at Veigar. Zoning him is ridiculously easy, dodging/blocking his skills takes little to no skill yourself. You need only create a freeze and you win lane because he can't get close enough to keep up in farm. \n\n> So stop complaining about the laning phase , the only way for it to get better is to take away from Veigar's teamfight potential, which would ruin Veigars theme for a lot of players including me.\n\nIf Veigar is to have his laning phase restored (AKA what I'm asking for in more reliable damage) his teamfight will be  just as good. He wouldn't be stopping dashes anymore, but he never used to be able to and that he can is even more broken than his old E, just more difficult to land and useless in a 1v1. But he'd still have an AoE stun to trap and zone the enemy, and more consistent damage would easily make up for his weaker E. Veigar's theme would be in no way ruined, in fact he would be (somewhat) returned to his former glory (RIP DFG)\n\n> Also the only way AD soraka and janna in 1v1 is better than Veigar is if you are so bad that you can't even land 1 skill shot.\n\nHave you ever played against these guys as Veigar? Janna maxes E, even if you land your Q her shield absorbs the damage and she just keeps wailing on you, with her W to keep you there longer and make her Q easier to land.\n\nSoraka has a silence field that is, OH MY GOD, longer range than all of Veigar's spells. You're not gonna land skill-shots because you're not going to be able to cast them (Her silence field is instant cast, like Veigar's old E, there is almost no avoiding it). Furthermore, because you have to walk off it both to be able to use abilities and not get snared, her Q becomes much more easy to land, with it's wide AoE. She'll heal herself up with that from time to time (she's not gonna land them all, but will land enough) and you're just gonna be frustrated with how impossible laning is.\n\nYes, you'll be better late game, especially since Janna/Soraka are terrible picks for a solo lane regardless of AD or AP. But that they can bully Veigar out should not happen.  That his only \"evil\" comes from not feeding the enemy so you're somewhat even 25 minutes in, that's not a tiny ***MASTER*** of Evil. He's not even an evil journeyman, more like an evil apprentice to his former self.","replies":[{"poster":"Aizeroth","date":"2016-12-01T21:36:22.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying your version of Veigar will ruin his theme or his late game.

I don't deny it, but taking away from his late game (i.e. making his E weaker by not stoping dashes, which it never used to, and by changing it to a skill-shot so that the farther away one is the more time there is to react) won't be such a nerf to his late-game that he is unplayable, and it would allow his laning to go more smoothly so that reaching late-game is a bit easier.\n\n> Also the old Veigar was not balanced and is never coming back so stop comparing him to the new one.\n\nThe old Veigar's E was not balanced. The new Veigar's E is STILL not balanced. More difficult to land + even more powerful when landed ≠ balance. It's a fair comparison when asking for the problem spell to be toned down so he can lane more effectively\n\n> Besides you, no other veigar player i know complains about his laning phase. It just seems like that you want an OP Veigar and nothing less\n\nMaybe they're not as vocal, maybe you don't know many, but all of the Veigar mains I know (depending on if you include myself or not there's 8-9 of us) detest his laning phase. Also, if I *really* wanted an OP veigar and nothing less, I'd be asking for the rework to be reverted and DFG to be put back. I don't play much ranked, mostly enough just to get and maintain season rewards, but over S3 and S4 I had nearly an 80% winrate on Veigar. As much as I'd love to have that Veigar back, there's just no way Riot will ever return him to that state. All I ask now is for a laning phase that doesn't feel like complete shit. I want to be able to PvP reliably, and not P avoid P and farm minions for 20 minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2016-11-29T17:59:02.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about ADC's like Ezreal?
