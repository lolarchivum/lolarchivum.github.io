There are times when triaging a lane is pointless or efforts are better spent elsewhere. Going top to help the 0/6 guy is likely going to end in a double kill.\n\nLike laners do have control over their lane and rightfully so. But fuckin' hell if it doesn't feel like losing a lane right now feels like \"Whelp better blame my jungler for not assisting me when he/she was bot.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knalxz","date":"2017-03-17T04:57:47.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jungle Mains:That's fair but you have to stop taking my blue buff when I recall.","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-03-17T13:32:58.390+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure it isn't the enemy jungle taking it?","replies":[{"poster":"Knalxz","date":"2017-03-18T07:17:33.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last time I checked the enemy Jungler wasn't on my team ignoring my pings to back off and my texts telling them I need it and them replying \n\"I need it more.\"\nTaking it then within the next minute dying to the enemy laner giving them the buff.\n\nIf you're behind, let the jungler figure out a way to help you, don't just go running through the damn jungle taking as many camps as you see fit then going back into lane because all you've done is make it harder for the jungler and unlike a gank where EXP and gold is shared, just farming the jungle only nets you one person bonuses.","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-03-18T11:08:52.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, not to mention every large monster someone takes would've been bonus experience for the guy with the jungle item.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-03-17T05:49:03.004+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not just a problem top lane.  Here is a situation I just had in a game as Taric supporting Vayne against Zyra and Ashe.\n\nWe were pushed under tower all game trying our best to farm and not feed the lane.  Our Rammus comes rolling in at 7 minutes in with no items thinking he wants to help the struggling lane and I ping him back.  He goes in anyways so we try to help him not feed a kill.  Instead we feed them 3 kills.\n\nSome more context:  I had about 150 HP and enough mana for 1 spell cast.  After the gank Rammus said \"you guys needed to wait for the taunt to go in.\"  To which I responded something along the lines of I was out of mana and couldn't really help so that was a stupid gank.  He then told me all I had to do eat some damage so he could kill them.  Does he not know that 1/4 hp at 7 minutes in with no items means you can't just eat some damage?","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-03-17T13:29:24.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although I wasn't the Rammus and I don't have a replay to see what happened, Rammus might have intended to just walk away from Zyra and Ashe while his W was still giving him bonus resistances. And all of a sudden the champions that he meant to have healing up while he created a distraction get themselves killed! Something like that has happened to me. I go in as a tank just to create some havoc and annoy the enemies...and other times I go in wanting kills. It's all just whatever. You shouldn't feel obligated to help with the gank, but jungle players need to be more respectful of their opponents and not bite off more than they can chew. The nice thing about playing tanks IMO is you can go in more often and survive even if you didn't kill anything. If you rattle your opponents, they might make mistakes later, so a failure to kill them isn't always a failure for the gank itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-03-17T18:54:24.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like, if you're going in just to harass them, you probably need to tell the laner(s) that before you get there.

Knowing it won't work and doing it anyways is just stupid.  He was going in with full intent expecting us to help him in a 3v2.  My guess is he didn't even look at the lane before he went in to see we were both under half health and both completely out of mana.  In that situation, he should have gone around the back side up the lane and covered tower for us while we heal up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
