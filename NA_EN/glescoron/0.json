Besides being incredible awkward to say in conversation, burrowing is not all that she does. She's queen of an entire species, she hunts and kills those foolish enough to travel through her domain. This would be like calling Cho'gath the \"void eater,\" or Kha'zix the \"void hisser.\" \n\nThe Terror Beneath was the PERFECT subtitle, punchy, memorable, gets right to the point of what she is and what she does. I guess if you wanted to stick with the tradition of having \"void\" in the name, that's fine but I doubt anyone would mind if you made an exception. I certainly wouldn't.\n\n**Quick Edit**: I didn't think this thread would be quite so well received so I wanted to say thanks all for your ideas and votes. Keep it up and someone will have to listen. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"PickleBabah","date":"2014-12-08T02:19:14.785+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":1,"body":"Saying Void Burrower is like saying Yasuo, the Sword Guy.\n.-.","replies":[{"poster":"AdgharKH","date":"2014-12-09T00:14:42.315+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz, The Poking Squidfrogfish","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saors","date":"2014-12-09T02:22:01.368+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand. the guy on fire.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2014-12-09T06:28:21.980+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Brand the Burning Vengeance is already fairly redundant on its own, though.
