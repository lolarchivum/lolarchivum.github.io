Don't worry about that. Although now your comment has stirred another idea. Now I'm thinking of the Nexus blogs where developers have shown their thoughts and opinions, and I'm honing in on the idea of narrative and what lead them to making _that_ path viable over others. It'd be a nice look into the narrative process and I think a lot of would-be writers would be fairly interested in it.\n\n\nLike, an example I'm thinking of is writers getting into the heads of champions to work out their mindsets.  Because I'm biased as balls on the champion I'll use for example would be Varus. When playing as him, and using his Piercing Arrow, I can imagine the rage and power that's placed behind the shot. An image of massively destructive power collects and pools into my head, as if I'm within the mind of Varus himself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grym Bolt","date":"2016-11-03T01:54:56.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"By make it a thing, I meant the community make something like that.
