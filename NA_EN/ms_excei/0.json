It made me realise the new riven riot created has no real way to get back to noxus.\r\n\r\nShe is shown to be someone in the process of becoming an ionian, someone who really hates noxus and wants nothing to do with it. She completely turned her back on the empire and blames it for the mistakes of individuals(for her own mistakes too)\r\n\r\nEven if riot magically made her realise she wants to be a noxian again it just wouldnt work out. She betrayed her homeland. Her faith that was the only recognisable thing about her is now non-existent. She is not a good commander. She does not understand war nor how the noxian empire functions. She is very gullible. She spends years building up ionian homes instead of wandering and learning about the world. Thus when she would return to noxus she would have no real knowledge of the outside world. She would be worthless to noxus, a traitor or a mere puppet \r\n\r\nBut even if magically noxus embraced her return it would be quite hilarious seeing riven lecture swain or darius on how the empire or the military should be run. She has her fancy imaginary ideas while the others bled for noxus and literally went through hell for it. They worked their ass off to make noxus better and keep it from falling apart. Theres no way that would work out\r\n\r\nRiven, as she is should be an ionian, a disillusioned soldier who found a new life.

My prediction is that after she's helped the townsfolk she will go in search of Yasuo to help him make amends with himself. Hence sending her on a journey across Ionia, meaning she still ends up wandering.\n\nShe hated what Noxus was becoming and what it was making her, however,it's not about her magically wanting to be Noxus again. It's about her wanting to make Noxus a better place, that's what her old lore about and that's what ~~i think~~ it will be about when she decides to go back. Swain's version of Noxus is willing to make a monster of the empire, and this is where eventually characters like Riven will come to play, assuming she's back in Noxus by then.\n\nHowever, I understand the points made and yes, **currently** Riven does seem that way, but I think that's just a sign of the long journey ahead for her character.","replies":[{"poster":"MS exceI","date":"2018-12-07T12:56:41.782+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not that i disagree i just cant see how its supposed to happen. In the rewritten lore rivens company was the only one who transported the chemical weapon. Since riven agreed to do so one could say she was a part of the problem. Its nice that she learns about peace in ionia but that has little use in a nation dependent on war. Riven herself also doesnt seem like someone who cares enough for the functioning of a nation. She joined the military to have a better life in other words for personal reasons. She didnt bother to understand how things in noxus really were, she just cared for glory and wanted to belong somewhere. When it all was stripped away she got a second chance in ionia which she was more than contempt with. Its hard to see her suddenly caring for noxus even if she matures and becomes more experienced. She would never be taken seriously given how she cut and ran. And from outside she will never understand noxus. Noxians on the other hand would never welcome her back without a good reason.

Darius and Le Blanc are perfect examples, they are their to keep him in check, and potentially can steal power from him if he no longer lead the Noxian vision, Darius' story is written as though Swain beat him to the punch by killing Darkquill first.\n\nSo Riven could return to Noxus, as a powerful warrior and a potential threat to Swain, should he end up going down the wrong path or should Le Blanc and the Black Rose become a force beyond his control.
