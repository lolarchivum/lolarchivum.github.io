{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2016-01-22T01:34:16.828+0000","title":"Mid-Year Mage Update","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all,\n\nThe next class update will be focused on &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Mages and I&rsquo;m here to give you guys and gals some of the initial details. Similar to the Juggernaut and Marksman releases, these updates aim to take look at an entire class of champions and accomplish 2 primary goals:\n\n1. Ensure the class as a whole is relevant and satisfying to play\n2. Differentiate each champion within the class\n\n**Why Mages?**\nMany Mages are intended to lack mobility but have not necessarily been given clear answers as to what they should do about it or why they work without it. For each sub-class of Mages (this is something we&rsquo;ll dive into more in a different post) these answers will vary, but our intent is to make it clear that each of these champions is powerful in their own unique way.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, many of them no longer meet our evolving gameplay standards of interactivity, depth, uniqueness, etc. This is also an opportunity to go back and adjust these champions (especially some of our older ones) making them more interesting to play as, with, and against.\n \n**Who are we working on?**\nSimilar to the Marksman update, we&rsquo;re aiming to release ~6 significant updates. The champions we are currently considering (but are still subject to change) are Malzahar, Vel&rsquo;Koz, Brand, Vladimir, Cassiopeia, and Zyra.\n\nFor each of these champions we aim for them to be 3 things:\n\n1. **Distinct** - offer a unique reason to be picked\n2. **Cohesive** - deliver on their core thematic and gameplay fantasy\n3.  **Healthy** - balance-able and fun to play as and against at all skill levels\n\nNote that given the scope of these projects, we won&rsquo;t necessarily solve every issue on every champion - and fortunately we won&#039;t have to since all of the champions already succeed in their own way at some of the above.\n\nOn top of the 6, we are again looking to do a sweep across the entire class (as we did with the Marksman) to find potential tweaks that will make them more unique, interactive, and exciting to play. The smaller-scale changes done to Twitch and Lucian are good examples of this.\n\n**What can you expect? When?**\nWe&rsquo;ve learned a lot from our previous projects and better understand the line between something unique and something unfamiliar. Our priority is to find ways to evolve and enhance the current direction of a champion while still accomplishing the above-stated goals.\n\nIn some ways, the feeling of change is unavoidable; we are updating these champions so things WILL be different. We&rsquo;re confident that we can retain the things you guys love while adding new dimensions. \n\nThis is all still a far ways off, so don&rsquo;t expect anything soon. As you can infer from the title, we&rsquo;re aiming to release these changes around mid-year and we&rsquo;ve only just begun to delve deeply into these projects.\n\n**How can you help?**\nWe&rsquo;d love to have your guys&rsquo; feedback and opinion on the Mages before and during their development process rather than only at the tail end - especially for the &ldquo;big 6&rdquo; (Malzahar, Vel&rsquo;Koz, Brand, Vladimir, Cassiopeia, Zyra).\n\nWe are most interested in the following about your favorite champion:\n\n1. What aspect is most core or sacred to their identity? \n2. What issue bothers you the most when playing them?\n\nThis doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll be magically giving everyone dashes or any other instant remedies to all their problems (weaknesses often exist for a good reason). Instead, this information will help us understand which direction to take each champion and where the opportunities lie. \n\nWe won&rsquo;t be talking in the short-term about exact changelists since we&rsquo;re still in such a state of flux, but we hope you guys are as excited as we are about the updates ahead!","replies":[{"poster":"Jolan","date":"2016-01-22T01:56:05.573+0000","up_votes":369,"down_votes":14,"body":"I honestly have 0 issues with Vel'Koz. He has range, but only if he plays properly. Q is a mediocre nuke unless you clip people with the 2 orbs that shoot from the end. W is his only waveclear, which works fine, with an ammo system so he can at least double tap it to fully delete a creep wave. His E is the anti-melee skill, giving him a knock up and a knock away, which can't always be used offensively but soft-peels melees from him. The only problem I have is when I play against Vel'koz, I find that his ult is impossible to escape at medium range, given his high turning speed and a lot of map locations with limited movement (walls and ramps).\n\nWhy aren't you touching Swain? He has issues holding targets, given his W has a delay and a short cast range, meaning people can easily walk out of it. His Q, a targeted slow, only lasts for as long as the target is in range of the tether, which is broken very easily since it doesn't move with Swain but sticks to his cast location. His main damage in lane is through Q and E, which are both DoTs, meaning their power is mostly invisible and not properly felt. Swain has no decisive waveclear pre-6, since his only AoE ability doesn't get leveled and has a long CD, whereas his other options are single target DoT, useless for last hitting. After level 6, Swain gains sustained AoE damage in close range, adding more DoT power to his already strong Q and E, but doing nothing to fix his weaknesses for waveclear or target control. Instead, he gains a weakness in limited mana pool and mana regen, giving him issues with sustaining his R. Moreover, the short ranges of his Q and E, both of them being single target and targeted, means that late game he has no effective ways to poke or anything, besides landing lucky Ws, which is his anti-melee tool. He is forced to engage or be engaged on, so that he is in melee range of the enemy and can torment them. This isn't fixable via items or masteries or runes. \n\nThat's why I think you should consider looking at Swain as a major target for the Caster Update.","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2016-01-22T03:58:41.524+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":19,"body":"Swain was definitely very high on our \"want to do\" list.

His Q is great — it has a unique targeting style, mind games with early activation, scaling off of geometry knowledge. Really a wonderful skill. His R is also very good — the scientist finally says \"to hell with all this\" and just fries everything. For that skill, the total lack of subtlety is perfect. The E is fine, if unremarkable.\n\nIt's his W that I object to. Vel'koz's other two basic abilities feel like you're testing your enemy's intelligence. His W is just a row of damage, then some more damage after a brief delay. It doesn't feel smart, it doesn't feel powerful, and it's too easy to use. It's also too easy to play against — you either take the damage or you don't. I also think that his passive could use some improvement. True damage is good, but it doesn't have a sense of growing discovery and understanding, particularly with how it just resets after you get your three hits in.","replies":[{"poster":"ardentbeing","date":"2016-01-22T02:47:59.898+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":6,"body":"Unfortunately, I feel Vel's W is too important to just change or get rid of- he can MOVE while casting it, and the double-marks it can put on an enemy is greatly helpful for his passive.\n\nTo heck with it sounding 'mad sciencey' I wanna play a champ that functions and has clear drawbacks and strengths.

The Q is there as a harass tool & wave clear tool, but it's main use is to summon the thorn spitters. The thorn spitters are probably the most useful plant if Zyra wants to do a large amount of sustained damage. A combination of her Q's low cooldown and the sustained plant damage puts her at a **halfway point between burst and sustained damage**, and I think she is definitely good at both if she pulls off a full combo.\n\n- Her E is the primary source of Crowd Control to defend herself against incoming enemy champions. It also serves to summon the thorn lashers, which are useful for providing a nice little slow zone for incoming enemies.** Grasping Roots in combination with the thorn lasher is an incredibly useful tool for evading ganks**, even if you miss the root! I do think that the snare projectile is a bit slow, but it does hit every single target in it's path in comparison to other linear skillshot roots.\n\n- The ultimate ability is mostly used as a counter-engage or a post-engage tool in a teamfight. However, **I don't think many people appreciate the attack speed buff** that stranglethorns give to Zyra's plants. \n\n_2.What issue bothers you the most when playing them?_\n\n-  My biggest issue with playing Zyra is that the **Plant AI can still be a little bit frustrating **to work with (despite the earlier improvements). When I manage to do a nice Q + W harass combo on an enemy champion, the plant would auto attack the champion once and then immediately switch to a minion when the enemy champion did not walk out of the plant's range. \n\n- In team fights, I do think that **Zyra's plants die too quickly from all the outgoing AoE** damage. Maybe we can consider giving the enraged plants more durability if they are enhanced by Stranglethorns?\n\n- As happy as I am to give the plants the attack speed steroid from her Ultimate, **it is sometimes hard to presummon the plants before activating her ultimate**. Is there a possibility that stranglethorns can leave some sort of \"fertile soil\" for a short amount of time after it's activation that would allow Zyra to summon more \"enraged\" plants?\n\n- Her **passive is not very interesting or useful for a \"plant mage\". **It sounds a bit more appropriate for a suicide bomber type of champion? \n\n- Stranglethorn's damage portion is sometimes hard to hit if you did not initially snare or slow the targets. I understand that the delay is there to give counterplay to the powerful large AoE knock up, however I think that the damaging portion of the ability should be activated a bit more rapidly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celestial Gait","date":"2016-01-22T02:00:30.995+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think on Zyra, she needs a new passive, as it stands, it's currently lackluster, feels weak and is delayed.

I can't believe she's being left out of the \"immobile mage\" reworks. Of all of them she needs the most help.\n\n50 damage on her lvl 1 Q, 95 at lvl 2 Q while having virtually no damage early on from AP ratios unlike AD counterparts, who not only have higher base values, but walk to lane with 80 AD and have better ratios generally. Item costs with combine costs over 1000 just to survive against AD mids don't help either. It's a joke. Syndra literally can't be offensive in lane as she is because the enemy regenerates faster than she has the mana to deal with.\n\n1 - Syndra relied on being a lane bully early game in order to transition to mid game that wasn't trash. Her current damage is in place to make her not able to kill anything early and let's not pretend the goal was anything otherwise. Combined with mana being nerfed into oblivion and masteries digustingly favouring ADs it just compounds the problem. 30% on TLD for AD, 10% for AP, great.\n\n2 - The mid game relied heavily on her being able to pick someone off with a Q E combo which DOESN'T HIT ANYMORE and is bugged up the ass despite all the patch claims that it's been fixed. Reaching this point isn't really even possible anymore now that the game is even more accelerated. Mid game doesn't exist for Syndra. Side note on the topic of bugs: Her R still has the same screen stuttering bug that was introduced in the patch Quinn was released. Press R, enjoy your screen shaking for 3-6 seconds.\n\n3 - Her late game was always trash and late game doesn't exist right now with 26 minute average games, so that's irrelevant.\n\nYour \"math pass\" to balance mage items seems as if it makes the assumptions that mages have the same ratios as ADs and that ADs don't auto attack. People still build Frost Queen's mid after the nerfs because everything else costs too much, unless they're facing an AD mid, in that case they having to magically come up with 3500 gold and get to lane before lvl 6 or die meanwhile the AD opponent needs 700 gold for 2 long swords and to press R.\n\nThis is what I hate about there being so many champions.

Can we take a look at his skills quickly?\n\nPassive: although this often gives fiddle an early advantage if offers almost no help in his two main roles. In the jungle this passive is next to useless in dealing with camps, and Fiddle's pre six ganks are unimpressive leaving the passive without out true meaning early in the jungle, while in late game the passive falls off in almost every aspect. Maybe some sort of scaling, or even a mechanic to help with cs (it would be great to make fiddle viable in lane) would be worth looking at?\n\nQ: This has always been a spell that has made fiddle \"feared\". After the nerf, yes it was a huge nerf, to make feared targets run away the spell was counter intuitive to fiddle's play. Back when a feared target would roam randomly it would often keep them in drain and crowstorm's range. now using fear with either of these two spells actually helps the target.\n\nW: Drain is fine and the true signature of fiddle. The high mana cost is fine and the spell is rewarding and thematically fine.\n\nE: Dark wind is in an alright spot, but was hurt greatly when it would not bounce to targets several times. If this nerf was reverted not only would it help cs but it would also keep fiddle competitive with burst mages.\n\nR: Crowstorm is fine and fun and very fulfilling maybe we can get a quality of life and have it cast at max range always just so we dont walk out of bushes and give away position or delay a gank over certain terrain . CAN WE GET AN AOE FEAR THO. GUYS AMIRITE? lol\n\nSo i know he's not on your primary list, but this beloved scarecrow is in dire need of love in some aspects of his game. Mostly reverting nerfs to his Q and E would put him in a solid spot. Thanks. Hoping i can get some sort of answer to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Statikk","date":"2016-01-22T04:46:34.615+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":7,"body":"Fiddle is also a champion we considered, but ultimately felt wasn't the right fit.\n\nTo do a quick rundown on our perception:\n\n1. Distinct - Fiddle is extremely distinct on the roster. Playing as and against him offer unique experiences.\n\n2. Cohesive - Fiddle is decent in terms of cohesiveness. He has a somewhat niche thematic as a terrifying scarecrow, but it's understandably cool. It could probably be pushed a bit further especially in terms of the satisfaction from all his base spells (Drain, Terrify, and Dark Wind).\n\n3. Healthy - This is debatable, but Fiddle is certainly not the largest health problem in the game. Tactically, his spells' gameplay could probably be more robust in terms of interactivity (counterplay). Strategically though, there are many ways to deal with Fiddle whether through vision, knockbacks,  stuns, etc.\n\nFiddle is certainly a bit dusty and old-feeling, but that means he may be more in need of a visual / polish pass more than anything. It's not like he wouldn't benefit with some more significant work, but he's a champion that we feel can be a put in a decent spot even with just some minor number tweaks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2016-01-22T01:43:10.035+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":6,"body":"{{champion:101}}\nThis champ's in a weird spot right now\nwhat did you guys think about him","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-22T08:00:37.207+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":7,"body":"> This champ's in a weird spot right now\nwhat did you guys think about him?\n\nI'm interested to know why you think Xerath is in a weird spot. Is it because of the state of the meta-game? Or is it that there's something he's failing to deliver that he seems to be intended to be doing?\n\nAs far as what we thought, Xerath seems to be up to par in Distinction, Cohesiveness, and Health. I've seen some people argue his gameplay is too similar to Lux to be considered distinct, but we actually see Xerath as more of an extreme range DPS mage, whereas Lux is more of an extreme range burst caster that relies heavily on catching squishies out and killing them with quick full combos.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-01-22T14:22:56.576+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd say Xerath is even less distinct than Vel'Koz. At least Vel has his passive true damage and his ultimate, everything Xerath does can be done by someone else while also providing something unique like Zigg's ability to siege and waveclear and Lux's sniping ability and utility. The only thing Xerath has is that he has _slightly_ more range than them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ragnaric","date":"2016-01-27T03:04:54.979+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding {{champion:161}} since his theme is about insatiable hunger of knowledge, I think it would be a great idea to include a passive added somewhere on his abilities (not replace \"organic deconstruction\" but make it a secondary effect) that gives him specific bonuses after killing an enemy. Something similar to Kindred's mechanic, however unlike Kindred this could require velkoz to get the kill (assists wouldn't count) and be capped at 5 bonuses, 1 per unique enemy champion (since he already has learned all he needs to know about a specific champion after he has killed them). \n\nIf he were to get such bonuses through knowledge, you could further make them unique by making his abilities evolve, much like how khazix evolves his abilities. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Q gets increased range and/or missile speed\n2. W detonates and/or recharges faster\n3. E radius increased and/or stuns\n4. R channel lasts longer and/or has a faster turning speed\n5. \"Organic Deconstruction\" only requires 2 stacks to deal true damage\n\nOne final thing, his E's knock up is for some reason not treated as a real knock up and therefore can be mitigated by Mercury's Treads, could this be looked at and fixed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-01-22T04:35:45.722+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please stay away from Vel'koz, don't break something that's not broken.

Nether Grasp: I don't think any changes are needed to this ability.\n2. Voidlings: A fun and unique part of Malzahar's kit that should remain in his kit (you could convert damage to magic if you wanted, but it might get a bit too strong).

I truly believe that he is a viable mid laner in his current state however he isnt without his problems. His biggest issue is his badish ratios which make him scale somewhat poorly into late game. \n\nIf anything he could use some 'touch up' work rather than drastically changing his abilities. If you do decide to make significant changes to him however i would ask that you keep his Q and Ult mostly intact as they are core to his identity and kit.\n\nOne idea i have for potential changes would be for his passive to have increased damage for each time it triggers over a short duration focusing his identity and game play more towards triggering passive for damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zimsky","date":"2016-01-22T02:08:10.744+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"You guys planning on doing anything to Syndra?
