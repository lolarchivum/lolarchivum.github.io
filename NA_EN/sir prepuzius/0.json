Yes, other drugs do attack different parts of the brain and can affect the levels of dopamine, seretonin, and cause other chemical imbalances due to the way they activate these receptors. They do, however, have an effect upon the pleasure/reward system upon the brain and depending upon level of intensity of use, can indeed result in permanent inhibition of these receptors.  This is part of why drugs such as methadone are considered so important as part of defeating addiction abuse because while they activate similar receptors, they normalize the behavior of the individual.,\n\n> \n> Excessive gaming, and other impulse-control disorders, do not have this affect.

No wait, you are.\nYou literally just said an individual who has been abusing heroin isn't comparable to an individual who is jogging.  \nWell, yes, naturally *because it is a difference in the degree to which the brain is being activated*.\n\nObviously an individual who jogs for an hour every single day is not going to show similar neurological effects compared to a heroin user of five years.\nPrimarily because of the fact that the intensity in which the brain is being rewarded for an action isn't to the same effect.   \nGetting tapped lightly on the head is entirely different from getting punched in the chest?  WHO KNEW!  \nOh, but both can result in the death of an individual if either of those areas were struck to a certain degree.  \n\nSecond, you are entirely focused upon the withdrawal aspect as the crux of your argument, but this isn't a strong point of the argument because of the fact that *individuals who have had their brains scanned after being identified for mental addiction to video games/sex/and other behaviors have similar alterations to their brains as individuals with subtance abuse disorders*.  \nI a study conducted by Weinstein (2017), it was determined individuals with IGD demonstrated lower WM and GM in certain areas of the brain associated with pleasure and reward.  \n\nThese same individuals demonstrated similar *withdrawal symptoms to individuals who are involved in substance abuse due to the effects upon dopamine receptors.*\n\nnow of course, illicit substances such as heroin usage is going to demonstrate these physiological structures and behavioral alterations more quickly than an individual with a behavioral addiction. This is primarily due to the nature of substances involved which have a more intense, and immediate effect compared to a behavioral disorder but this does not mean the end result is any stronger or lesser than an individual who has an addictive behavior.\n\nFor example, individuals who are actual sex addicts demonstrate lower levels of brain activation the more they engage in a certain behavior, requiring a strong stimulant to achieve the same level of \"pleasure\". The method by which they do this can vary, and they suffer severe issues with their decision making as well as suffering withdrawal symptoms when that addiction is no longer met though they may suffer these withdrawal symptoms to a lesser degree depending on the level of addiction. An individual who runs a mile every single day is going to feel uncomfortable if they aren't allowed to run that mile, but that isn't withdrawal.\n\nThe argument you are making is the same one people make in regards to cannabis use. That the drug is safer, or non-addictive because of the lack of withdrawal symptoms which are not as intense compared to heroin or crack or methamphetamine abuse.  \n\nI am sorry, but objectively Eedat, you are wrong.\n\nI state this as an individual who works in the field of psychology regularly and does conduct therapy with individuals who suffer severe addiction.

Why are all these things that can produce literally the same exact chemicals so drastically different?

(Keep in mind there's a difference between an alcoholic and a social drinker).\n\n-People who abuse drugs initially do so either because of medical needs to relieve pain/a mental disorder, or because they like to experiment for \"highs.\" This becomes a chemical dependence, and they continue to use because they don't like the withdrawal symptoms, which are quite severe.\n\n-People who play a video game, initially do so because it is socially acceptable, something they foresee winning to some threshold, and they have an overvalued sense of skill. They continue to play, not because they \"like\" the game, but because they have financial investment from when they speculated they could \"win,\" and because their logical brain still sees that silver lining as a possibility.\n\n\nIn my case on gaming League of Legends:\n\nMy primary account is Diamond II.\nBut..... I created smurfs.\nI found out very quickly that my manner of playing a large sampling of champions, most of whom do not have reset kits, do not hold the strengths of actually smurfing in Season 7-8. They can play their roles, but just aren't as influential on winning as champs who can reset, and I can't split push when my team dies every 40 seconds, and I'm the only one alive.\n\nSo.... I set a goal. Get the smurf to gold reliably, and then I could just go play Norms/occasional diamond game. So far, I haven't been able to. I get occasional computer freezes that get me killed. I have a wife who likes to sabotage my weak multidimensional multitasking (living in the real world while also carrying). I have a son who randomly pounces me. And, then I have the usual in game feeders who make every game a solo carry or loss.\n\nI keep thinking to myself: If I get all my accounts to Victorious skin level...... I can just ..... relax... be less toxic, and play games that don't matter.\n\nThat's my void I'm trying to fill. So far..... I've met that objective 6 times.\nAnd each time, it put me so far into the IFS's crosshairs that shortly after reaching it, I got banned. Lost it all. Start over.\n\nI can tell myself over and over that even THESE games don't matter, and I don't need to be toxic in them..... But you know..... who actually listens to themselves?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Prepuzius","date":"2018-10-11T07:58:47.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm not getting it..\n\nif you don't like it how can you get addicted to it?\nsaying i smoke 20 cigs at day but i don't like it, it's the most hypocritical thing i could say\nyou're just avoiding responsability, like \"hey i hate it but i have a medical condition i can't do anything about it sorry\" (then proceed to joyfully puffing away)\ni remember every first cigarette in the morning was pure heaven, but hey, i didn't like it, i was just addicted... sure.. i was in pain while smoking actually..\n\nyet i have to understand again how could you even get addicted to something you don't like \nplease, i'm just that stupid, don't give up on me , i want to understand","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rawiazam1","date":"2018-10-09T16:36:49.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Illabethe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3WAkO3vJ,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-10-09T15:57:08.044+0000)\n\nexcept the fact that addiction to games aren't physcal addictons but mental addictions. which are different things","replies":[{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-10-09T16:53:16.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prove it.","replies":[{"poster":"rawiazam1","date":"2018-10-09T19:50:16.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=y0r1ck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3WAkO3vJ,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-09T16:53:16.909+0000)\n>\n> Prove it.\n\nsome wikipedia:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_dependence\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_dependence\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction <- we are talking about this thing. other links are to show you that addictions aren't the same\n\nsome \"real\" sources:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272277/\nhttps://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.159.10.1642\n\ndo you have some proofs that it doesn't exist?","replies":[{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-10-09T23:39:21.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your own sources try to prove that there is a positive correlation between behavioral and physical addictions.
