No other champion just gets 'double stat' for a passive, and it's important because now 4 items for full crit (two zeal, IE, ER generally) becomes two (which is basically IE/PD as I understand these days) where his other four open up. The bulk of his damage benefits from crit anyway, he can crit from a range and he gets CC. He has unique defense, hard mobility (with a target) and he gets a shield. He has an initiate after knock-up with his ult, and it comes with free bonus pen to tankbust or work through tricky bruisers.\n\nAll that, and they decide the only way to balance him is give him double crit. Isn't it enough that he gets crit on abilities? Double crit, really...\n\nThe second try is probably {{champion:163}}. This seems weird but hear me out. If you can't make the champion work off the line, they're not ready for release IMO-- Taliyah felt rushed, looks rushed and probably is rushed, all things considered. They keep scrambling to make her gawky Q work, and her absolute top gun amount of positioning and circumstance needed for half of her kit to go off, who the hell cares about a MS passive? She's awkward as hell. Too bad if she speeds up to lane; Riot still has no idea what the hell they wanted for her. It sounded like they wanted a BAMF Toph-style earth-based champion with a real 'impact' feeling and they ended up with Pebbles, the Magical Waste of Space.\n\nI don't like Taliyah. She feels really vague and indirect for what League boasts about wanting. Her design isn't broken, over- or under-powered, but she doesn't really feel like an 'earth' champion. Malphite feels more like the rock, Taliyah would feel at home with a strong, up-front kit or a Wind-based kit that keeps enemies at a distance the whole time.\n\nAs it is, the only range she occupies is 'who cares.' I understand that she was broken off the line, but even in my experiences playing her I just didn't enjoy it. There was nothing conducive about the kit. It was just... thrown together, some neat ideas that would have worked together if they made worked ground anything except 'HA HA! YOU DON'T GET A SKILL NOW.'\n\nIf they, you know, worked on her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Getcuxcd","date":"2016-09-25T21:50:20.948+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"LUX because shes more annoying and aiderous than riven zed yasuo and fizz COMBINED","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-09-25T20:12:56.430+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Obviously {{champion:157}} \n\nRunner-ups would be {{champion:76}} {{champion:92}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Besthunterjk","date":"2016-09-25T10:45:01.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:114}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-09-25T10:43:00.369+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"draven is pure bs with that scaleing q but even so he doesnt in validate any beefy melee character thats just Vayne. well and fiora but shes melee and has all that mobility and damage for real cheap and easy to use though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoffeeDave","date":"2016-09-25T19:17:41.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"only one? {{champion:16}}","replies":[]}]}
