Zoe thinks she is in competition with Lux.  (That same age as Lux part makes it confusing as well.) but on the other spectrum, Aatrox is scared shitless just by SEEING her. He knows what is going to happen and what she can do.\n\nI believe its the lack of interactions with \"humans\" that make Zoe childish from our standpoint because of manners. But she on the other hand thinks that we \"lack\" a lot of stuff she has, like freedom of responsibility/expression, near-infinite experience and immortality, powerful magic...Which comes to the question, who is the \"child\" now then?\n\nAlso another thing.\nI think there is a good explanation why Zoe likes Ezreal, but never talked about any other \"boys\". Ezreal exercises his freedom for adventure, curiosity just as strongly as Zoe does. He even has a dimension warping bracelet. Many may dismiss this as another example of \"childish\" behavior, but once you think of it it is quite logic why she thinks Ezreal suits her. She is just carefully concealing \"why\" she chose him.\n\nPS: Zoe thinks this is pretty,\n\"The sine of 2a times the sine of b minus c times x plus the sine of 2b times the sine of c minus a times y plus the sine of 2c plus the sine of a minus b times x equals 0... yeah, that's pretty!\"\n\nCan you comprehend what it is?

So.\n\nLook: just because it happened in the past *doesn't automatically make it correct.* Are you seriously trying to say that just because we had girls marrying at 12 means that it's okay now?

But it's okay to take an ancient civilization's word on it over our own modern science that proves otherwise, apparently? Okay then. \n\nWe can debate morality in fiction because fiction affects reality? I think it's valid to point out if something in fiction normalizes something harmful.

It is ridiculous to compare real life morals to a total fiction. Don't you get it?\nAlso if you think at those days, they start making children the instant after they are married, that is another mistake you are making. Of course they will take years after doing that to settle down socially and start working for the family. Say around 2-3 years. I think since because of mortality rates of ancient times it is the best they can do. It may not be \"good\" but can you blame them for that?\n\nSee? you overlooked even a obvious factor since you shoehorned it in your own moral standards without the context. Fiction can be bent where it is chosen, it is futile to debate about it.\n\nAll that matters is Zoe is a champion with a interesting kit/lore for her mains.","replies":[{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-04-17T04:38:08.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I said that fiction affects reality.

Being an adult is not truly a concept that can be defined by age. We just do so for convenience. It's the difference between being an \"adult\" (which you physically develop into) and being a \"grown-up\" (which you transition into as you leave behind childhood).\nHonestly, how many 18-year-olds can claim to have fully-developed and become an adult? Not many. (In fact, it's at about age 25 that a person has truly finished growing. It's all downhill from there.)\nHow many 18-year-olds can claim they're ready to take on the responsibilities and expectations of the grown-up world? There are people in their 30s who would have a difficult time making that claim.\nBut age is still relevant, of course.
