And here are some bits I picked out but you could view the rest of the answers and sources in the doc linked above\r\n\r\n* Kayle in currently on a mission to find out what happened to her mother and Jellbug believes she was able to reach the land beyond Targon Prime\r\n\r\n* Morgana is currently hanging around the outskirts of Demacia and rectifies wrongs she sees fit\r\n\r\n* Kayle has a horrible way of dealing with her mistakes, she suppressed her feelings and there's a side of her that fears that what she was did wrong and that she's becoming a monster\r\n\r\n* Kayle's view of justice is very by the law, she believes all crime deserves punishment relative to the scale of the crime, very eye for an eye, and once you are punished you exhumed from your crimes\r\n\r\n* Morgana's view of justice is more nuanced, she believes it depends on the persons intent. She believes that people who did commit crimes deserve to be fully punished for their crimes and that pain and suffering are crucial to reformation \r\n\r\n* Kayle's worst quality is her self righteousness and her best quality is her idealistic nature to deal real good and protect the innocent\r\n\r\n* Morgana's worst quality is her inability to let go of past mistakes and her best quality is the empathy she feels for all\r\n\r\n* Mihria's swords falling from the heavens don't necessarily signal her death, don't trust offscreen deaths, but would mean something significant has happened to her and she needs her daughters' help\r\n\r\n* Kayle and Morg still love each other despite their emotional baggage and would require humility from both parties to make up or a common foe\r\n\r\n* Kayle has issues with Demacia's current state of affairs because she believes they twisted her original ideas to an extreme and there's Sylas running amok \r\n\r\n* The reason why Kayle has lighter armor is because they wanted to read more like a squishy champ","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-03-08T03:09:46.820+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":15,"body":"AMA on reddit, god dammit...","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-03-08T03:19:01.732+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"They always have their AMAs on Reddit.\nWhere else would they have their AMAs?

The sisters are twins, and the fact that some random dude who serves under Kayle can somehow undo their relationship after he actively tried to imprison his deity's sister and died seems wrong to me. He's thrown in as basically a name and nothing more, so he definitely needs some explanation if you're to have us believe that he was able to break their relationship, especially since it doesn't appear that Kayle gave Morgana any opportunity to explain what happened before throwing a fit and raining fire down on everything. Who is he to Kayle that she would turn against her sister for his death? Is it not an unjust act to try to imprison someone who has done nothing wrong? Why would she approve of his actions in such a way?","replies":[{"poster":"Jellbug","date":"2019-03-12T00:24:24.058+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! This is a great question, and something we'd like to address if we were to tell a story about their background. \n\nHere's my view on it - Kayle and Ronas were very close. He was one of her first followers in her group of Judicators, and she cared for him. He also never saw eye to eye with Morgana, and probably constantly argued with Kayle about why she had this one blind spot for her sister. Likewise, Kayle cares a ton for her twin, who hates Ronas. So Kayle is constantly caught between these two people in her life that have opposing views and don't approve of Kayle caring for or even interacting with the other one. \n\nWhen Kayle found out her sister killed Ronas, she was shocked and heartbroken at the sudden loss of her close friend. With the baggage of all their arguments from before, she acted irrationally and assumed Morgana, who she knows has this celestial power and is stronger than Ronas, intentionally murdered him. Kayle's emotions spun out of control, leading her to unreasonable violence, and wanting to purge the city of all evildoers to protect the innocent. She does realize this is a huge mistake, but can't accept this fact, so she suppresses it deep within herself under tons of self-righteous control. Her reaction is to try and lose as much of her humanity as she can, growing colder and less emotional and more distant, so that she can make \"fair\" judgments and do the right thing, in her mind.
