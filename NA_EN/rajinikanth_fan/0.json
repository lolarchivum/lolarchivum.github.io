Talon as a support is a lot more risky, but IMO is still way less of a griefing pick than \"fiora support\"  b/c talon can zone the enemy botlane (especially if they're both squishy champs) and can hard punish if they over extend with just a W>Q>auto trade so the enemy botlane has to respect your kill lane potential (actually works incredibly well with an {{champion:22}}  adc b/c her slow enables you to hit both parts of W guaranteeing your passive).

There are options for ranged DPS viable in top lane matchups. So with 2 friends you could run ADC top and a Cheese off meta kill lane bot.   I think some reliable DPS with CC would be ideal. {{champion:80}} for example, Plus he could roam using his R at which point Fiora support should snag some CC and scale quicker.\n\nAs there are lower options in your usefulness early compaired to a massive # of available options when running this as a support it should be treated as a cheesing strat.
