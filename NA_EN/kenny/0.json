Then we have a bunch of solo cast members who we don't know where they fit in, people like Ahri, Jax, Lee and Udyr (Isn't he Frejlord tho?)\n\nAlso, keep in mind how many people actually have connections to the events in Ionia. Shen, Akali, Kennen and Zed are their own Story arc in their own bubble and Syndra in her lonely bubble too. The people connected to Noxus invasion are Irelia, Karma, Yi (maybe Wu by extension, but that's hazey), Lee, Soraka, Varus, and Yasou. \n_____________________________\nThat is 7 people who are connected to a large scale event.
