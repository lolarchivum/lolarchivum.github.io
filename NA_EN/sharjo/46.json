So this means this is the first possible appearance of an Ascended who can actually create life, unless Malphite's actual life came from something else. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=zounet,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vUELhhvi,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2020-02-19T16:06:36.824+0000)\n>\n> Malphite has gained life with the magic of the monolith but also with the effect of the void\n\nThe bio never said that that's what gave the Monolith life. We know Ne'Zuk gave the Monolith magic; we know the Void destroyed it. We know Malphite reawakened after being the last of the Monolith left, but we don't know how Malphite's life itself came about. If it was Ne'Zuk himself who gave the Monolith life, then this would be a big reveal in the scale of creation power that the Ascended might be capable of: life creation. If it was more of a spiritual belief-kind of awakening of life, then we can assume that Malphite, and by extention, the Monolith's, life can be attributed to similar origins as Janna and the demons. Hell, it's possible that the rock itself was alive before it was made into the Monolith. We don't really know anything about Ixtali Ascended magic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
