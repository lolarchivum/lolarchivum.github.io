So are they involved and do the killing, or are they detached and only bear the soul away after it has been freed?\n\nThey do the killings.  What it is though, most people do not \"comprehend\" Lamb and Wolf. Thus, their attacks appear as other things.   Lamb and Wolf only appear when they want you to see  them. \n\nThe bandits that killed everyone in a violent way very well could have been Wolf attacking them in a violent manner whereas the heart attack Maggra experienced was an arrow through the chest and to the human eye looks like a heart attack. \n\nEven if you look at the login screen. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0qOpSoP7Vg\n\n\nNotice she has no quiver, and the arrow that penetrates the king is wispy and spiritual.  It's pretty safe to say her arrows don't even leave marks on the physical body.  And, if you look at the screen there's a weird distortion that shows like someone is peering into a different realm to notice them. ((notice that where the echos stop, Wolf's body disappears))\n\n\nAs for Kindred's behavior towards Maggra.\n\nI think what you were experiencing was something called \"the cross roads\" She stumbled upon death and was at a point at her life where her next decision very well could have been her death.  She was technically \"already dead\" and thus Kindred appeared for her.  If she'd have ran away a bandit would have found her and killed her ((wolf)) but she did not run away, and ruined the balance of things. \n\nThus, Kindred became intrigued as Maggra incidentally changed her fate by staring death in the eye.  Thus, Kindred gave Maggra the option to choose her own death as a reward, and also because she played along to Lamb's game and \"entertained her with conversation.\"  Thus, Lamb personally gave Maggra a long life and a quick, easy death much later in life while she was doing what she loved, and completely distracted.  She even mentioned \"when\" she was going to kill Maggra. \"We enjoy your shows, and we will continue to watch them until we meet again))\n\nAlso, you can tell Wolf was the result of the camp being destroyed ((he passed  OVER Maggra, going  the direction Maggra CAME from))\n\ntl;dr we perceive what they do to us on a different level, because our mind cannot comprehend them unless they allow us to.","replies":[{"poster":"wanderer of time","date":"2015-09-24T02:48:00.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to forget that there were dead bandits next to the playwright.","replies":[{"poster":"Amélie Cauchemar","date":"2015-09-24T07:06:28.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=wanderer of time,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0Otrq9Ry,comment-id=000f00000000,timestamp=2015-09-24T02:48:00.454+0000)\n>\n> You seem to forget that there were dead bandits next to the playwright.\n\nAnd that means what?

As a fourth year English/creative writing student at university , I've studied texts from just about every era. Fluff is still fluff. The safest way to approach an \"older\" styled writing is not in presentation of the actual prose, but in the context and dialogue. Shakespeare can be dramatic and \"fluffy\" because it's a play, its dialogue is meant to be preformed. Prose should not be fluffed in this manner. Even older texts from the medieval ages (which I have a certain affinity for) are some of the least fluffy texts I have ever read, because they were mostly written by monks. Of course, none of this historical context matters because (surprise) Runeterra isn't a real place.\n\nBUT, just saying \"well it's fictional language it can be as fluffy as it wants\" is a weak excuse for sub-par writing. (No offense to the author(s).
