Not the 1v1 matchup. The team v team matchup. I think the notion that feeding = bad player is horrifically misguided because it vastly underestimates the base rate of feeding with given starting conditions.\r\n\r\nI think some people already have a notion of this. You don&#039;t feed Kat, Leblanc, or Kassadin. They snowball hard, so even letting them get a bit ahead can really screw you up. The only problem is that the very things that make them snowball hard are what make them be able to snowball in the first place. Sure, it sucks that Kat go 3 kills. It really does. But are you seriously telling me you don&#039;t expect Kat to get 3 kills somehow?\r\n\r\nIf she _didn&#039;t_ get 3 kills to snowball, that&#039;s evidence for problems on HER end, not that you played properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there&#039;s two things at work here: the first one is people&#039;s tendency to not account for the base rate when judging probabilities, and that leads to horrible over/under estimation when certain things are skewed. The second one is the judgment based on feeling. Yes, it fucking sucks that KAt is snowballing. That does not necessarily mean your teammate (or you) played poorly.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s assume both you and your opponent are playing equally well. The enemy is a snowballer. What is the expected outcome? If your answer is, &quot;Ori plays safe and doesn&#039;t feed,&quot; you have basically said that the expected outcome in Pro play of snowballing champions is that they don&#039;t snowball early game. And that&#039;s ludicrous. Sure, they might not snowball as hard as pub matches, but you should expect for them to snowball. It&#039;s what they do. They way you don&#039;t let them snowball is by outplaying them. You know, by _being better at the game than them._","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-09-19T10:52:52.679+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin snowballs after... like 10 kills.\n\nHe's pathetically weak right now... you legitimately have to try to get him fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2015-09-20T00:44:30.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not as bad as Talon.

Past Syndra, past Akali, past any of the other uber-nerfed champs hit for being just too darn oppressive in the right hands - Kass was hit so hard for having mobility (and it being about the only thing allowing him to do anything at all) that his burst is now mitigated almost entirely by the existence of _Spectre's Cowl_ - not even the full item, just Spectre's Cowl is enough.  Last time I saw a Kass get a teensy bit ahead, I told our Vayne to build one.  She did.  She got the 500 gold shutdown bonus the next time he tried to jump her and proceeded to snowball us to victory.\n\nKass needs the CDR because otherwise he's not doing damage.  The only exception is if you're just so far ahead that even Zilean would be able to carry with that kind of gold.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fatalitý","date":"2015-09-20T16:28:21.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the Kassadin post, Kassadin is probably the worst mid laner in the game right now.

A better example would be Riven since she has pretty good early game and has a lot of multiplicative scaling that makes her offense scale faster than most people who go against her.\n\nThere's also the opposite kind of snowball, like Gnar, where you basically just survive lane and you get tanky regardless.\n\nThen there's champions like Jinx who snowball temporarily.\n\n\nMy post isn't saying that snowball champions never get shut down or even rarely. They quite often get shutdown, especially in higher play. My point is that these higher level players _probably_ don't have the mindset of expecting Kat to do poorly in lane because she's weak early on and therefore more or less ignoring her. They probably have the mindset of simply assuming she is going to snowball _and then by expecting that outcome they anticipate what she will do and then subsequently shut her down before she can snowball beyond control._\n\nThe reason I use Kat in this particular example because at least to me, it seems to be consistent with _everyone_ and not just an outlier. If you expect that Riven is going to snowball, you take countermeasures before it even happens. If you expect Jinx to get a proc on her passive, you start doing things to anticipate mitigating that.\n\nWhether that's probabilistic expected outcome or strategic game theory, it doesn't exactly matter. I think the more successful people anticipate this outcome instead of complaining that it's bad teammates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"53436278DEL1","date":"2015-09-19T03:09:09.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good post if they want to snowball by roaming since ur not feeding them in lane prep for it by warding pushing and following = set up counter play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-09-19T17:56:47.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If our team has AoE dislocation/silence or point and click hard CC yes I don't expect Kata to have the chance to channel her ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"slippykitten","date":"2015-09-19T16:34:15.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Feeding isn't the same thing as losing a lane. \n\nNo matter what, you should always be able to end a laning phase at least at 0/2/0 and down about 20 cs when your tower falls.

This is because you're retarded. You went and fought over and over and over thinking that the result was going to be different even though you were only getting farther behind. This is gross negligence for your team. This is the arrogant child who thinks \"i'm either going to win this lane and carry or im just gonna feed until my team helps me carry\".

I'm pretty sure if player A has 100 cs and is 5/0/0 and player B has 0 cs and is 0/5/0 at 10 minutes, this is a skill difference, probably between two players of vastly different skill level since 10 cs per minute on top of trading and ultimately killing someone once every 2 minutes is actually extremely efficient play (plat-diamond level). Just getting 100 cs per 10 minutes is actually pretty damn good.\n\nIf this is 20 minutes and person A is 5/0/0 with 200 CS and person B is 0/5/0 with 100 cs, that is suddenly much more different. This is also still a skill difference between players, but now player B in scenario 2 is probably more skilled than player B is scenario 1 due to ratios.\n\nYou're also assuming someone is equally good at playing defensively as they are offensively. If you have two people of equal skill level and both of them are very good at punishing mistakes but not very good at playing defensively, someone is going to make a mistake and then the other one is going to punish them for it.\n\nSo the result is that you have 2 people of EQUAL overall skill but both highly skewed to offense having a laning phase where the snowball just starts immediately. What is the expected outcome? It should NOT be that the laning phase goes tit for tat; that's just not how games go. People go on streaks and then something happens that breaks that streak and then the other person may start going on their own streak or the first person might start another streak.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1v5","date":"2015-09-19T16:19:46.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Pro play of snowballing champions is that they don't snowball early game.
