Again this is mainly to deal with the possibility of misclicking an attack, but also once you get the hang of it, it just feels fluid.\n3.  _**Entering brush:**_ If there's an enemy in the brush, you'll often want to attack move into the brush so you can attack as soon as you enter, rather than moving into the brush and then issuing an attack command.","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2017-05-27T01:17:15.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh!

Say you are trying to click a minion and click just next to them instead, your character will just walk to where you right click unless you quickly correct it.  By using attack move, you will only move as far forward as you need to and attack the closest thing to you.\n\nThe reason to use it is that if you are in a teamfight and miss click, the last thing you want as an ADC is to just be wandering into the enemy Assassin when you actually meant to attack him, so by attack moving, you might move forward a step or two, but you'll stay as far away as your attack range is.\n\nAnother good use is if you need to facecheck a bush, and you A click into it, you will immediately start attacking anything that is in that bush.  So while you may still die from the champion that you facechecked, you'll still get a few hits in before you actually see them.\n\nAll you do is press A and click instead of just right clicking.  I currently have mine bound to space, so in a team fight, I right click away from fight, space near/on enemy, right click away, space near/on enemy.  Some people used to bind it to left click, so you'd just alternate left and right click.\n\nPhylol did a simple guide on it if you'd like to see.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uWqC7jP3f8","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2017-05-27T19:11:40.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, thank you! :o","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-27T13:56:37.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh, I've never used attack move at all.

Could be a minion you want to last hit or an enemy champion. With regular attack if you misclick and click near your target, you start moving there, which most often is what you do NOT want (esp. if it's a melee champion). With attack-move if you misclick, you will attack either your target (if you clicked closer to it than any other enemy unit) or something else which while not ideal is probably better than moving toward it.\nSo I would start with using attack-move for that, rather than for cases where you want the \"move\" part (those are useful too, but trickier to explain). Did this explanation make sense?\n\nFor ranged junglers, it also makes kiting much easier, but I do not think you are asking about that...\n\nP.S.
