Mordekaiser can't excel at being a tank because he has no cc, and in his new changes, they LOWERED his damage even more.

Two point and click nukes. Honestly, all he would need late game is just a Q + R to kill most champions. Also, his R has a pretty bad mechanic attached to it. He gets to scale off of his opponent... so if he's doing bad, and he feeds the enemy, he gets rewarded by being able to nuke them even harder. His stun was also problematic, because it was a huge, instant, AoE stun on a burst mage. Burst mages should not have that kind of CC.\n\nI will say though, the delay on his E is too long. I think that 0.5 seconds would be much better, just like Cho'Gath's Q. Lowering the ratio on his R is also justified, as it already has an enormous base damage, and very high scaling on your AP, and then high scaling on your opponent's AP. \n\n500 + 120% AP + 80% opponent's AP is extremely high for a point and click. Lowering it by just 20% AP is completely fine.\n\nI don't really like the Q being changed to a skillshot, however. It's his bread and butter skill, it needs to stay consistent. I don't mind having is Q targeted, as long as they change his R to a skillshot.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, and I know I'm going to get downvoted for stating my opinion on Veigar. I just think that adding a little more counterplay would be nice. Also, don't mention how \"Zed can beat Veigar so well\", this is not about Zed, it's about Veigar. Zed is a much bigger problem and has nothing to do with Veigar. Zed needs some changes too.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-02-15T08:33:59.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll go ahead and type a better comment than what Vahlen made.\n\nVeigar since mobility creep came closer and closer has been losing out to the mobile assassin mids. He has barely seen any, if at all, a form of LCS play despite being as powerful as you say. The issue was that even though he was extremely bursty, the range of his abilties could put him in a very high-risk position, and his only CC being in the form of his E. You are quite unlikely to hit your W without stunning them, as the massive delay on it makes landing it so hard. His Q's short range limits that to either anyone diving him or farming for AP. The entire reason Veigar was still mostly viable was solely because he had the lockdown capabilities in his E. His ult does scale off the enemy's AP, and while that can easily 100 to 0, say, Lux, he can still be outranged by her unless he gets her in the edge of his E. I kind of like it, though, even if the damage is pretty bullshit. I like the idea of a non-assassin Anti-mage. It's a role that no one else in the game really seems to fulfill. The damage reduction on his R is quite satisfactory to me, but the delay on his E will just make him that much harder. Remember, only reason he really excels is due to his E + W + R + Q combo, and giving it a delay just gives extremely mobile champs the passage to avoid Veigar's only form of CC. Also, his passive sucks now. I don't recall what it was like before mana changes, but now it's pretty bad.\n\nTL;DR - Passive pretty bad, Q is okay (even if I do like it point-and-click), W has way too long of a delay, E is of severe controversy and probably shouldn't have been given a delay, and I feel his R nerf is justified.\n\nAgain, these are my thoughts. I'm not a huge expert on Veigar, but this is how I feel about him as of now.","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2015-02-15T09:07:44.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for actually giving me a thought out response, and not just insulting me. I think I've just had bad times against a lot of Veigar's because of his ult, mainly. I even remember getting a Penta kill as Viktor in ARAM not too long ago, and right after I got it, Veigar spawned, walked over to me when I had about 80% of my health, and pressed R to deal 2300 damage to me for an easy kill with one button. He was behind too... so I just have mixed feelings on him. I might also be biased because I always hate when people say that \"so and so champion is bad because everyone has mobility\". I play Mordekaiser mainly, so when I hear that this champ sucks because of mobility, I get mad, because not all champs have mobility. Maybe I just have to face the fact that Mordekaiser is the underpowered one, and not everyone else is just overpowered. Anyways, I can agree with what you said. I've played Veigar a few times so far, and I find that landing a W on someone once they get Merc treads is near impossible. I don't think they can lower the delay time unless they lower the damage though. 320 + 100% AP is quite a lot for an AoE ability. If anything, they should just keep Veigar how he is on live. I think he's perfectly fine without DFG. DFG was sort of the overkill item for him. He never really needed it to kill anyone, because he could simply DFG + R or DFG + Q to one shot a lot of champs or just take them out from half health.","replies":[{"poster":"Reazale","date":"2015-02-15T16:34:19.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See , thats a good line of thinking.\nThe thing is that Veigar has no other defensive mechanic than his E, and even tho its a really strong skill it has no dmg, long cd and its usefullness is compensated be the others short comings of his kit (the heavy delay on his W, Q-R range and high ult cd).\nI do agree that the 80% enemy ap on his ult is kind of bs , and i was expecting it gone , but insted of doing that they lowered the Veigar ratio (so he is less rewarded for farming/getting items) and heavily nerfed his only defense mechanism.\nAnd if u think his W should be nerfed if it were given more reliavility its ok , but that dmg and ratio will have to go somewhere else, else he will lose a lot of dmg , most mages todoy have 3 dmging skills , and if they dont the lack of dmg on such skill is compensate be dmg elsewhere (if u want to check , Viktor is a good example of this with a base dmg of 1075+2.33ap ratio {1080+2.8 is Veigar}  if u get everything and only 1 ult tick {it gets higher for each ult tick that u get}).\nAnd if u complain about Veigars \"high dmg ult\" let me show u this:\nDragons Rage:  Physical damage: 200 / 400 / 600 (+ 200% bonus AD) (+airborne xD)\n\nBuster Shot: Magic Damage: 300 / 400 / 500 (+ 100% AP) (guess the trade of a 1000range knowback is .2ap and the other ratio and she is an adc -.-')\n \nMega Inferno Bomb:  \tMagic Damage: 250 / 375 / 500 (+ 90% AP)  (same base , HUGE AOE and 5300 range? ok)\n\nBlade Waltz: Maximum single-target damage: 325 / 663 / 1001 (+ 234% bonus AD) (LOLZ)\n\nTrueshot Barrage: Magic Damage: 350 / 500 / 650 (+ 100% Bonus AD) (+ 90% AP) (:D)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-15T23:34:19.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost never play Veigar, and I mained Zed for a long time.

What I wanna say is that Kassa actually pays for his insane mobility in form of reduced damage and limited burst. I think Kassa is a perfect example of a balanced mobility-based champion.\n\nNow let's compare him with another assassin with similar mobility and similar role like {{champion:7}} LeBlanc is:\nQ: 110/160/210/260/310 +0.8 AP\nW: 85/125/165/205/245 +0.6 AP\nE: 80/130/180/230/280 +1.0 AP\nR: mimicking Q/E: 200/400/600 +1.3 AP | mimicking W: 150/300/450 +0.975 AP\n-Considering she deals full damage from that ability.\n\nI know that is pretty off-topic, but I just wanted to clarify why you can't really compare {{champion:38}} Kassadin to truly problematic champions. I actually think Kassadin is an example of healthy high-mobility champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LottaLettuce","date":"2015-02-15T22:24:10.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PoisonedPeace,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=38IuxOYo,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-14T20:11:03.443+0000)\n>\n> Kat\n> Leblanc\n> Fizz\n> Nidalee\n> Zed\n> Kass\n> Edit: Lee Sin\n> \n> R.I.P.

On that list kassadin is the only one whos actually tanky but kass has always had problems anyway.
