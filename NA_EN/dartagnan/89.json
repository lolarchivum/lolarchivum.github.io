Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nThe first patch of the 2017 Season is finally here!  It&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve tinkered with the game, but hopefully it&#039;ll give us a chance to smooth out some of the edges.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uLIffs5.png\n\nWe want to make sure to start off the first patch of the new season on the right foot, so if you encounter any issues, check out the solutions below!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>*** Error: &quot;League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client or try again.&quot;***\n\nThis issue rears its ugly head if something went wrong in either the updating or the installation process of the Client Update. The solution is to complete a full and clean reinstallation of League by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T.\n\n>***My IP Balance in the Store is incorrect***\n\nThere have been some issues with the client pulling correct IP balances. Some players have been able to resolve this by launching into the Legacy Client and making a single purchase to resolve this. If this does not work, hit us up in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll work together to resolve this.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"KrAxXx","date":"2017-01-11T11:07:33.248+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"hi guys! i have a biiig probleeeem!!! after choosing the champs in the room when the game charges and after it starts my screen turns black and i have to use the magical alt+f4 to exit...when i try to reconnect the same...and i can hear all the sounds, even type in chat...but i cant see nothing...its all black","replies":[{"poster":"CowBoy Memo","date":"2017-01-11T22:37:11.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got the same problem and also some of my friends","replies":[{"poster":"VerVistas","date":"2017-01-11T23:46:35.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here since today and it's really bordering me since I simply cannot play because of that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T17:08:46.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Per the[ status page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na), some players with full screen enabled might find issues  upon loading in.

First, you'll want to **log into the Client** then you'll want to navigate to your config folder, which should be in this directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, hop into a custom match to check if anything has changed as a result of the steps you've just taken.
