Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":15,"down_votes":12,"body":"> #***UPDATE Feb 11th:  Qihoo 360 Total Security Issues***\nWe have found that Qihoo has been causing significant problems with patching 6.3:\n* *Causes the patcher to appear for a second, then immediately disappears*\n* *Causes the patcher to display a \"Unspecified Error\" message*\n* *Pops up a warning about malware*\n\n>If you are using this Security Software, we strongly recommend temporarily uninstalling the program to see if it resolves your issues.\n\n> You can get further info and more troubleshooting steps in [Son Golin's Post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/TEFbgqWZ-new-having-issues-patching-63-click-here?comment=003f0000).\n\n\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWith Lunar New Year celebrations winding down its time to look ahead to Valentines Day!  We&#039;ve been super excited about it and even created a card to let all of you know how much we care!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WPfG6UH.jpg\n\nRemember, if you have problems with the patch, we got you.  If these steps don&#039;t help, drop us a comment and we&#039;ll respond!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n> #***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> #***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n> #***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"tempo wave","date":"2016-02-10T23:30:28.429+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"my league of legends wont start it just dose that  league of legends icon before it starts and it stops","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-02-11T21:30:44.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this is a usually a common issue during patching, we are seeing a lot more reports than normal.
