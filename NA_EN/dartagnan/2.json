Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":11,"down_votes":8,"body":">#EDIT 8/1\n\n>A Hotfix was successfully deployed that should have resolved the crashing at the Loading Screen due to the Patcher being pinned to the taskbar.\n\n> If you are still experiencing crashes or Bug Splats at the Loading Screen, this is probably a different issue altogether.  Make sure to check out our[ Game Crash Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) for some solutions to resolve this!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n>#EDIT 7/27 \n\n>We've been tracking an issue with this patch where players who have the patcher pinned (instead of the desktop shortcut) to their Windows Task Bar consistently crash/Bug Splat when they attempt to get into a game after Champ Select.  We are working on a hotfix ASAP, but there is a temporary work around to get this solved:\n\n>1. Un-pin League of Legends from your task bar. \n2. Use the patcher's \"Repair\" tool (click the question mark in the upper right-hand corner).\n3. Launch League normally\n\n>If this still doesn't work, you can also just [completely re-install League of Legends](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)\n\n>We'll update everyone once we get more info about the hotfix!\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nFrom how the laning phase works to the technologically enhanced PROJECT skins that will be released sometime in the *future*. Behold the latest and greatest!!! Naturally, Katarina in usual fashion, just thinks she's PROJECT: Better than You. Typical.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OhZA7eq.gif\n\nLet nothing stop you from experiencing this Brave New World, least of all patching issues!  If you have an issue, check the steps below that should move you past it and into the client!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>#***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n>#***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Universal Scarf","date":"2016-07-26T09:23:42.300+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"My game started crashing upon reaching loading screen into the match, after installing patch 6.15.
