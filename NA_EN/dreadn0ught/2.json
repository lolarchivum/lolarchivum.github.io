The difference is how far down you fall though. Don't expect to place up into silver from Bronze, it's not going to happen. I do need to tell you though, if you're really good enough to be in Silver...you will be. 2 seasons ago I was in your position, my placements dropped me from mid Bronze to B5 with 0 LP. Maybe you can hold your own a tier or two above where you're at, but it's time to focus on what areas you're failing at and where you can improve. That's what I had to do, and it's really payed off for me. I'm currently at high silver low gold (I haven't placed yet but I ended the pre-season at G4) and it's all because I've always thought about what mistakes I make every game and how I could have played every fight better (including fights that we win, and fights where my teammates make mistakes, there's still things I could have done better).\n\nI understand it's really frustrating, and if you don't want to, normals are a good place where you don't have to worry about how you play.

Some split pushers end the game with a 1< KDA but can on occasion almost single handedly win the game.\n\nI've always been of the opinion that, if you are ranking players individually, than individual performance should matter. Since its hard to quantify, as you stated, what individual performance means to a match given the context and circumstances of it, I proposed a solution back in season 3 where your performance in match was compared to all players playing the same champ and role as you across all skill levels and that every action taken by you would calculate a match score rating that would be displayed at the end of the match and that this score could then be used to manipulate MMR and LP gains or loses. We basically got the first half of that, verbatim to the system I proposed, with the addition of the champion mastery system more than a year ago. Sadly, Riot chose not to include the reason I proposed this system and it does not interact with the MMR and League Systems at all. It's my hope that in the future improvements will be made to it and we may one day see it help influence MMR and LP gains and losses so that players performances can more accurately reflect their skill level more quickly. Only time will tell.","replies":[{"poster":"Wintershere","date":"2016-01-21T23:52:39.407+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new champ select and the assigned role I would think they would be able to utilize in-game accomplishments as part of the ranking system similar to what you described there.
