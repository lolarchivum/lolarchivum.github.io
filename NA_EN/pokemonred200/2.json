Well, not exactly.\r\n\r\nOhmwrecker has a notable issue of being an item that&#039;s so rarely purchased, despite several iterations around its concept  (starting as a purely defensive option, then moving into a hybrid HP/AP item, then returning to a full tank item). This is an issue that I feel cannot be fixed using stats alone, for the following two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The active component of {{item:3056}}, while powerful, is likely not something that can be given a stat profile beneficial to any particular group. This is because an offensive stat profile for the item would make it incredibly oppressive if it gave even remotely decent stats (due to making turret dives oppressively easy for offensive champions if it were useful to them), while giving it a defensive stat profile would take away from the usefulness of the active (tanks and juggarnauts are generally able to take damage from a tower for longer time periods than {{item:3056}} can disable them, leaving other defensive options like {{item:3143}} and {{item:3742}} better if they need HP and Armor. Even {{item:3512}} is better if they want the point runner passive from {{item:2053}}.)\r\n2.  The longer a game goes on, the less useful the active becomes. With less towers, there are less times when the active can even be used at all, especially given (without Item Active CDR) the active has a cooldown of two minutes. This means you want to get it sooner than later, but again, other options for its stat profile tend to provide more useful active or passive components, and they remain useful throughout all periods of the game as well for a similar price point.\r\n\r\nSo what could be done to give Ohmwrecker a satisfying niche, without breaking it? I&#039;d like to see some of your ideas, but here are some of mine (though one of them is an idea given by Meddler a few months back):\r\n1. Remove the current active entirely, and replace it with an effect similar to the Demolish Rune. This would give it an effect that allows a tankier champion to break towers without a larger damage threat (like {{champion:115}} or {{champion:18}}) present.\r\n2. Give the active a _defensive_ property; if it&#039;s used in range of allied towers, this tower becomes much more damage resistant and deals increased damage to minions while damage immune. This means that it can be used for last-ditch comebacks in the later stages of the game, and isn&#039;t a trap purchase should you fall behind while building it.\r\n\r\nI think doing something like the above two would help the item not stay in complete and total obscurity, though I&#039;m really not sure. It just seems like the item has a really obscure niche that&#039;s difficult to fit into a decent spot, given it&#039;s always been tower-related in purpose. What are your thoughts on {{item:3056}} as an item, do you think one of the above options would make it have a decent spot in a champion&#039;s inventory, or would it need a complete overhaul with an entirely new niche/stat profile?","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-09-17T01:19:33.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2018-09-22T11:08:16.723+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are like a million things you can do with it\n\ndisable structures, not just turrets\n\nor\n\nBoost structures\nImagine amping up a zz portal so it's range and spawnrate increases \nOr increasing a turrets damage\nOr making heimerdingers turrets stronger \n\nIt could work on pets \n\nzap tibbers to make him bigger and badder with elctrical attacks because why the fuck not\n\nit could be something else entirely maybe it could zap and ground an enemy who attacks or damages you drop an on target cd on it to not make this a complete ass of an effect and you got yourself a cool tank item\nthis would be the passive part of\nthe active would zap everything around you and ground them putting the passive on cooldown too\nit could also work on large and epic monsters and then we turn it into OHMhulk for tank junglers because we need that\n\nI think one of the biggest problems with current ohmwrecker is that the active is completely pointless because you don't need it with the stats the item itself would already provide. and it gets ever more useless as more turrets die and you get more beefy with or more damage so you spend even less time under turret or could already sit there for a century with no issues \n\nHere is another idea for it, it can now construct a tesla coil which zaps enemies at random or targeting whover you are hitting or whoever is hitting you\n\nIt's not that Riot can't think of anything to do with the item because i can fart out a million different idea's for it \nthey just do not want to do anything with the item otherwise it would have already been done","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-09-18T14:55:24.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about stripping the stats out of it entirely and making it a consumable item?

Personally, I don't think there are enough ad/armor items in the game (Read: there's one), and it could serve as the second ad/armor item (There are 3 ad/mr items, for the record. So clearly it is not much of an issue for such items to exist). Give it something between 30-60 ad, and 30-60 armor (Unsure what the specific numbers should be, needs testing); and an effect that favors bruisers (as they'd be the one most likely to need such an item).
