For all we know, deep down, he might still view Shen as a friend. \n\nThe main reason I love Zed is not just because he's my favorite character to play, but also because of his lore. You can call him evil if you want, but he only did what he did because he has a heart. Because he felt hurt. And too often nowadays you see heartless villains in stories.

It might go from Kennen and Akali training under Shen's father to them training under Shen himself depending on how they do things.
