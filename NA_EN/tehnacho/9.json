I&#039;m really perplexed about it. Anecdotes are a really good way to introduce an issue and connect with possible readers, but they should not be the be-all and end-all of your argument, especially in reply to more quantitative forms of evidence. Luckily, many of these sort of posts get downvoted to oblivion, or at least ignored, but a few will always slip by and get to the top of the Hot page and I worry that Gameplay is going to further devolve into personal screaming fights if this catches on.\n\nEDIT: Oh cool this popped up. \n\nJust to clarify, I'm not downplaying the use of anecdotes entirely. They have a time and place and we should always be critical of statistics when something is off.\n\nWhat I'm calling out are the people who blatantly ignore any and all facts to shoehorn their own opinions and agenda. I'm also not sure how the name and shame rule works in this sort of thread so to those of you posting, be careful when you provide examples for the rest of us.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-04-13T16:31:51.008+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sometimes it's even worse: \n\nI still can't believe that I saw a coment with more than 50 upvotes calling Xayah a hypermobile adc when the only movement she has is the extra ms when she autoatacks with W.

It's an opinion stated on how you think something works/performs in a given situation. Observing something is just one step into actually examining it \"scientifically\" - by the use of specific methods/measuring tools that can extrapolate raw data from the event. After the data is collected, it needs to be processed correctly by having a baseline (something to compare it too).\n\nRiot collects all sorts of data from how we play our games and with which champion.\nIt's not just about winrates, pick rates, ban rates, runes and builds. They can break it down even further than what third party sites like op.gg usually show us.\n\nAn observation you stated is that \"Jhin is bonkers with a Guinsoo's Rageblade\".\nBut it isn't a fact. It's an opinion derived from a fact that Jhin's damage scaling is unique.\nHe scales from multiple stats and all impact his damage/MS, which makes Rageblade such a solid buy for him, as a 4th+ item. However, his AS (which is essential to DPS champions like Marksmen) never scales from its default value. Which means that he has hard time reaching 6 Guinsoo's stacks to fully utilize the item. He can very well get killed before he even reaches its full potential.\n\nWith this observation in mind, it's time to look at the facts that come in the form of Jhin's win rate, pick rate, ban rate, itemization, runes, etc. If they sit within the norm of his pre-Rageblade times, it's likely a sign that he needs to be broken down more in terms of laning phase (early, mid, late game), his damage against specific targets (mages, juggernauts, tanks, turrets, objectives), how easy(er), etc.\n\n---\n\nObservational anecdotal evidence can never be taken as a fact.\nIt's just an observation.\n\nStatistically shown hypothesis is factual evidence.\nIt is when you apply it to your observation that you know for sure if you were correct in your assumptions or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JPLangley","date":"2018-04-13T22:20:19.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why didn't you cite every terrible decision made by the old balance team and every good decision by the new balance team in your fuck-awful OP that proves everything wrong with this community?\nOh wait, the \"I'm just a human\" defense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"epic dude2611","date":"2018-04-13T20:44:48.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Statistics mean nothing, we have to back up statistics with either \n1: a fully fleshed statistical model ( we don't have enough numbers for this)\n\nOr \n\n2: educated guesses as to why these statistics exist","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-04-13T21:05:18.814+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They mean more than anecdotes at least.

(That doesn't change the fact that a 1300-2000 AD scaling is a completely broken mechanic which is in fact caused by a circular calculation that shouldn't exist)\n\nWin rate stats also didn't tell the full story on {{champion:142}} , because in fact her win rates could be broken down into more specific stats. Her win timeframes: Pre 20 minutes (surrenders) and Post 35 minutes (When most games were going too long, scaling champs are fed, and when she could actually reliably be a force for a TEAM to be reckoned with). In reality. Her win rate PLUMMETED when she was in normal length games, because the period between 20 and 35 minutes was a point where she received no power spikes, because her CS begins to fall off, and her second item doesn't really change game momentum. It's her third and 4th items which changed games).\n\nAnd then there's the fact Win rate stats are actually biased toward new players who don't know how to play them. If you follow the win rates of most champs by people who actually main them and have a significant number of games, they generally often push 54-57% win rates. However, some are pushing 48% and others are pushing 63%. That doesn't tell you enough information, but it does tell you that those champs need to be looked at to decide whether the their irregularities are because of some mechanic that's too weak, or because it's a skill capped champ which is actually strong. It still tells you more than an overall \"win rate.\"\n\nFurthermore, Game stat pages do not capture irregular builds. They exclude them in most cases, and some of them have much better stats than the meta retrieved statistics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2018-04-13T21:18:41.181+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your feelings do count for something.

They see different levels of performance of champions. Nobody's experience is invalid, but what causes controversy is when the experience is attempted to be generalized to the entire populace. It is near impossible to generalize these experiences due the vast deviation in performance that can be seen.\n\nThe only **true **generalization that can be agreed upon is the **actual kit**. The literal functionality of the kit is what is true for all people playing this champion. Thus any arguments that have any value in a logical perspective centralizes on contradictions within a kit. However, as we all know, the kit alone is just a tool. Talking about a tool by itself will not tell us how it interacts with something else.\n\nThe reliance on interactions between other champions and items is what makes this process complicated logically as it is unavoidable. There is no convenient standard to observe the kit since the optimal situation is always changing. This is why anecdotes are necessary. These experiences give us a certain set of information and when conglomerated, it can show a trend of how the kit it actually is played out. The difference being that we see the **frequency **at which something can be observed.\n\nEven so, a reality can deviate far from the trends a chart shows us. It is these experiences that people have the most trouble with since it seems as though the game the play and the data that is shown does not align.\n\nIt's as if these experiences are not important at all.{{sticker:cass-cry}} \nBut they are.\n\nThe issue with using anecdotes in arguments has always been the **method** they are used. A single anecdote can never be generalized to speak for all experiences. HOWEVER, a single anecdote has the power to **DENY** a generalization.\n\nThus, in the case where a design philosophy is assumed by Riot, or even generally accepted by the public. If any one experience is found, that while under the same premises, fails to reach its conclusion, then you have successfully invalidated an entire design philosophy.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nWhat this means is that the theory that was accepted before must now be reevaluated. It's through this reevaluation that changes are more readily accepted.\n\nThus, the strength of anecdotes can only be seen when the theories that are accepted is known. If the theory is not made clear, it must be made clear. Propose a theory that people would generally concede to and then thwart this theory. If you have missed something, an attentive someone will be sure to let you know. Then you'll learn something from it. That's what matters in the end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HarrowR","date":"2018-04-14T15:54:34.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the worst offenders are adc hate circlejerkers of which there are many on these boards.\nI cant count the number of times someone tried to convince me all adcs are hyper mobile,tanky,1v1 gods that do 700 crit with only two items and dont need a support,yet as an adc and jg main i see things totally different,when i catch an adc alone in the lane with yi,kayn,graves its like killing a creep,they only get strong late game and with a good supp","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-04-14T15:31:02.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rise of the alt right","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-04-13T19:34:18.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait.....
