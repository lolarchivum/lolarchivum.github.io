This was a 20 minute game where my team fed the enemies beyond all hope and then surrendered. I was trying my best to not say anything to them. I was roaming and looking to help, all while still maintaining as much CS as I can. Let's be realistic here though, what can 1 player do against THAT? There wasn't and never is anything that can be done. This shit is as tilting as it gets. Not only did these people feed in my game, they then turned around and spammed the surrender vote over and over from 15 minutes until 20 minutes came around.\n\nHow is there anything balanced about this game right now? It isn't like this is something that's happening rarely, it's happening in probably 80-90% of my matches played. It's at the point where I am just about over this game... I literally can't handle it anymore. Call me a whining little girl, or whatever name you can come up with, but dealing with this situation over and over again 4/5 games is as bad as it gets.. Especially when there literally is nothing that can be done about it. Where's the counter-play? It's not like my laner went down there and killed anyone.. I roamed more than that Malzahar, and yet look... he has more assists and gold.. why? Why do I have to lose my lane which I was winning despite being camped, all because the rest of my team is getting destroyed?\n\nThere's nothing fair about this shit right now.  Please get rid of all this new bullshit added and give me the game that existed back in Seasons 1-3 where one player could make a difference, even when his team was getting shit on. I'm tired of this. TIRED. I don't believe in teamwork. Do you see teamwork? Teamwork is what happened in this picture. Teamwork is where your team costs you the game. Teamwork is where you literally are forced to trust everyone to do shit for you, and then you end up losing because they don't have a fucking clue in the world what they're doing. Teamwork IS NOT GOOD. \n\nJust because 5 guys on a stage can work together and provide good entertainment doesn't mean that shit works in everyone else's matches. The people on 98% of player's matches aren't pro players. They don't live, eat, and breath, with each other. We're strangers grouped together from different backgrounds, with different experience levels, playing a game together. Stop balancing around 5 guys living together holding hands day in and day out and fucking balance the game the way it should be for once.\n\nThank you... end of rant.","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2017-08-20T13:08:51.335+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was expecting an unBearable pun {{champion:106}}","replies":[{"poster":"boba drinker ","date":"2017-08-20T15:19:41.380+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ionian Vulpix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rKvyF1sZ,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-08-20T13:08:51.335+0000)\n>\n> Was expecting an unBearable pun {{champion:106}}\n\nI'm dead.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-08-20T19:21:33.455+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm alive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2017-08-20T20:04:40.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same q-q\nforgot to check the board tho, didnt realize it was gameplay","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-08-20T14:20:02.986+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":7,"body":"So the team with 4 people winning should have lost to the team with 1 person winning?

How can platinum players be matched with bronze and silver players within two teams? What's the point of all those divisions, if all that matchmaking system uses is some kind of BS MMR. \n\nFurthermore, how can you justify winning streaks and losing streaks? Basically, system recognizes you as a good player, because you win a lot, which means you are placed LOWER than you should be. And instead of allowing you to climb, because you clearly do not belong in the current division, game puts you on losing streak, and matches you with people, who are placed HIGHER than they should be. And those people drag you down and make climbing much much harder, which results in 10-100 games played only to get into place where you truly belong. Basically you are wasting a lot of your time only to climb where you should be ( your skill level ends there and you can't climb that well anymore), because system undervalued you.\n\nOver 100 million monthly players and queue can't find 10 who have similar skill level?

Even if the game finds 10 people with exactly the same MMR, all having played 500 ranked games already and everyone gets there prefered role, stomps may happen. It's simply due to human beings being inconsistent. I've had games where I solo carried with wukong. I've had games where I solo lost as wukong. On some days, I just perform so well, I'm aware of every gank and time my abilities and dodge perfectly. On other days I tunnel vision and keep dying instead of conceding some farm. You can't just say \"okay, this exact spot is my skill level and every game I will perform on that level.\" If that was so, Worlds would always end in a 3-0 sweep.\n\nWinning and losing streaks are a result of random outcomes which only get influenced slightly by your own performance. You can be performing better than your MMR and have a losing streak. You can be underperforming and still have a winning streak. It's because there are 9 other people that are over/underperforming either because their 'true skill' is different from their MMR or their day-to-day variance (match-to-match) in performance. The system doesn't try to give you streaks. These just happen. I've had a 13 win streak once starting with the first match of my placements. The funny thing is that my team was pretty bad in those first games that I carried and in the last 4 matches of that win streak, I always lost my lane and got carried by my team.

You can tell by how winning streaks tend to end in promos, and just how often people pass them in general. I know someone who dropped to diamond V, and to get back up, he had to enter promos 20 times, and that sort of thing is not that uncommon.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-08-20T18:49:47.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"copy pasta from above:\n\n> Winning and losing streaks are a result of random outcomes which only get influenced slightly by your own performance.

Their team will get 5 better players while your team gets 4. It'll be less likely that you are a positive factor in your team and your win chances will get closer to 50% (or even below if you got a streak to above your ELO). Sure, streaks are more likely to end because of your teammates rather than because of you since there are 4 of them and just 1 of you.\n\nI personally haven't experienced promos getting harder. I don't play a lot of ranked, but I climbed from silver to plat in season 3, from gold to plat in season 4 and from plat to diamond in season 5 and 6 and I have NEVER lost a promotion. Yes, I consider myself very lucky in that regard since most of those matches weren't carried by a teammate. But for every guy on the boards complaining about this bullshit bad luck, there's a (usually silent) guy like me sitting with some good fortune. Maybe Dunning-Kruger effect plays a role, but even without this, it's perfectly explainable. \nIF winrates in promos are lower than usual, I'd rather explain it by players performing worse under the pressure to perform in these 'important' games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Falcon Of Death","date":"2017-08-20T20:53:45.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Poro,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rKvyF1sZ,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2017-08-20T14:20:02.986+0000)\n>\n> So the team with 4 people winning should have lost to the team with 1 person winning?

While the other team has a full stack of plats. What the actual fuck is this matchmaking?

They control all roams, dictate fights, waveclear/engages, marksman only follow up, they can't do anything on their own.","replies":[{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2017-08-21T10:47:45.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what happens when you have a Mid that doesn't Roam? I have had a few of those before. Will just tunnel vision their lane only. It's just getting harder and harder to find this game enjoyable, because you are extremely dependent on your team to not fuck up their lanes. Now a days it just seems like the best way to win is to tilt your enemy laner by asking for a camp to make the enemy not want to play with this person anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2017-08-21T07:28:48.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eliminate an under performing variable by adding another constant (get a duo partner)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lanakila Au","date":"2017-08-20T21:16:59.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at my match history, I literally just came out of a 15 game loss streak.

Just had a guy with a 40% winrate and only 17 ranked games played get put in a 1600 mmr game. Fed like crazy. Died twice by getting solo'd by a nid jungle as he tried to get river scuttler at 2:00 and again at 3:00. The matchmaker is absolute garbage as is the placement system. Probably deserves to be in low bronze considering the way he was playing but the system put him in S1 and he was playing 1600 mmr(mid gold) games. He was not a duo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"devdev463","date":"2017-08-20T13:49:01.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it happens in literally 90% of your games, that's just bad luck.
