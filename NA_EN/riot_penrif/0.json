In addition, we pulled a couple abilities that acted a lot like invulnerability and went ahead and made them fully embrace invulnerability.  We&#039;re hoping this makes interacting (or not) with invulnerable champions a less frustrating experience.

Yi can still be damaged and killed by DoTs while Alpha striking, Fizz and Vlad can be hurt by both DoTs and tethers while troll poling/troll pooling. Elise can be damaged by DoTs while Spider E'ing, so adding this invulnerability HUD to abilities like that makes little sense. and if Riot goes ahead and makes them grant invulnerability as well, then they're getting buffed all around with a free Zhonya's (minus the root) built into their kits, which is unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"midorii","date":"2016-08-29T15:27:37.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally had no idea they still take damage while all the nonsense is happening.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-09-03T00:58:10.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Penrif,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Tt3km9pO,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-08-26T22:47:13.830+0000)\n>\n> Kindred and Kayle ults were the ones pulled into proper invulnerability.\n\nDoes that mean Kindred's gameplay has been changed, or just the indicator?","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-09-07T01:18:53.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same question... did i miss a patch note or something?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cavni","date":"2016-08-29T22:46:36.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Penrif,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Tt3km9pO,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-08-26T22:47:13.830+0000)\n>\n> Kindred and Kayle ults were the ones pulled into proper invulnerability.\n\nIf Kindred ult is considered invulnerability, why isn't Trynd ult considered invulnerability?
