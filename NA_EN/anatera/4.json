Don&#x27;t cry about it, learn all aspects of the game or take your beating and don&#x27;t complain about how you don&#x27;t understand why you keep losing.\n\nLet's lay down a couple assumptions here before I go on.\n\n1. Do you get a little much from tower plating? Sure. That 160 gold per plate is pretty hefty. It's leading to more lane dominant choices than roaming dominant choices and that's a pretty big impact on the meta.\n\n2. Are the games over just because of that? Not at all. When pros talk about, \"okay Gen G has a 2k gold lead over SKT\" they're not saying the game is over. That's a good 400 gold per person, that's not going to win a game. What it is saying is that they're getting outpaced and they need to pick up the tempo or they will lose.\n\nHow does this translate into NA solo queue? Same thing. Stomps are generally stomps because the player getting stomped is not playing at the same pace as the opposing team. Making the game easier to end out through aids like plating gold or rift herald simply make it easier to close out without having to make some crazy maneuver or macroplay, which is why low elo games are much more one sided.\n\nThat being said, these teams could easily come back but there is very little macro involved and very little strategy besides go for these objectives, and I dislike when people invoke, \"it's a strategy game why don't I feel like a strategy genius.\" when in reality they weren't ever being strategic from the start, just ambling around and trying to stall out.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2018-12-20T19:22:26.122+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly, implementing crutches for people who don't know how to expand their early game advantage is so face roll and a bad idea for a game like LOL, which was ORIGINALLY a very robust game in terms of strategy and champion options. \n\nPeople stomp lane as Draven but then lose cuz all they are doing is running around chasing kills? We better just make sure the Draven gets an extra 400g or more out of lane phase. I lost track a long time ago of the number of games which are literal free wins, but my team throws because they either don't know or care how to end games.\n\nI have probably played close to 100 matches over the years where the game goes a little later, but my team manages to win a good team fight and we take 2 inhibs then take baron. At this point literally all we have to do is go stand in bottom lane, let the supers push in the other two lanes, and just let minions kill the base. Literally all we have to do is stand near the last remaining inhib turret and not die. No fighting required, just free win, be ready to flash if they try to engage on you. What do people do instead? They insist on running down mid and forcing a fight. Or running down mid and trying to force nexus tower kills rather than just go to the last remaining lane and let the overwhelming waves of creeps destroy the base for you. I understand that games are about fun, but when you throw a game just because you want the joy of ending the game with a big fight, or be the one to last hit the nexus rather than supers, you've gone way too far.\n\nThat brings us also back to the point of lack of consistency and one dimensional play. If you are amazing at laning cuz you are a veteran one trick, but garbage at everything else cuz you never took the time to read patch notes or understand how other elements of the game work, you should lose a lot of games. If you are able to accrue large leads in lane but have a tendency to wander around in enemy jungle hunting for kills and then get gibbed, you should lose a lot of games.\n\nThe risk/reward ratio in the game is just busted. Making slightly disadvantageous trades for the early and mid game to try and just survive until champs or comps come online has become largely a thing of the past because early game has become so formulaic and just ok kill tower, then get drake cuz you just killed, bot, then go kill herald for free cuz you are already so far ahead that fighting you is suicide.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gall","date":"2018-12-21T04:05:54.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people are on the fence about wanting long games vs medium-ish games.

What do you all do in 40 minuts that is more strategic than 25/30?\n\nI agree, the game is WAY faster because there is clear objective now, especially compared to the older seasons, that allow you to further push your advantages. But is it less strategic? Na.\nIn S2/S3, since everyone were a clow that didn't know how to proper TF, having even baron wouldn't assure the winning team to have an advantage and so games would drag along.\n\nPeople talk about 30/40 min games like they were all INCREDIBLY heated and strategic, na man, many dragged along.\nSome of them were this awesome game that we all loved where it was tensed and you were playing good but so did the ennemy and you worked your ass off to find the proper way to win. But it is still the case now.\nFuck, I have that in ARAM man. In freaking ARAM.\n\nThe ONLY thing I will ever accept in this whiny shitty gameplay section is that damage got front loaded with runes (it isn't much the case anymore, even the crazy DH became subpar) and that it tend to make fights be very unforgiving/faster than you want. It is why people always suck the tank meta like it was godlike when it wasn't, it is just that not having assassin/burst mage or pressure based laned (notably bot) meant fights were way more forgiving and less stressfull.\nAnd at our level, we make WAY WAY WAY too much mistakes so even a bad assassin will be able to punish some of them.\n\n\nJust give better defensive options (either in tanks being better, defensive item feeling less terrible to build on carry and calming down some abuser case), remove old leblanc (what? What do you mean I am biased?) and trust me that this game will be just fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2018-12-21T21:14:43.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Your last 5 games are like 30+ minutes long, some going all the way to 40.
