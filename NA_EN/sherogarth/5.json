So the idea here would be that if you want to get back to the fight sooner, you have to kill or be killed. And Morde still doesn't have any MS/dashes or blinks at his disposal, meaning that mobile enough champs could still kite his ass and run circles around him.\n\nAs far as i'm hearing, Cleanse or QSS would still be an option for removing his R curse (maybe not Cleanse). Which would mean that Morde's best use case scenarios for his ult would be to pick a fight he could win, against a champion that would be fighting him instead of running away.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-05-28T01:19:52.764+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sherogarth,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cyZ8uyR5,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-05-27T20:57:52.092+0000)\n> \"Lets challenge this 0/10 {{champion:157}}  , they definitely looks like a good and fair fight.\"\n\nyou dont need to challenge that, he will challenge you and your team 1v5","replies":[{"poster":"Bronzsuo","date":"2019-05-30T15:44:08.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The wise sage has spoken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nevrankroaton","date":"2019-05-28T06:16:41.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for info, it was confirmed that the ult can be remove by cleanse and QSS","replies":[{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-05-28T06:54:57.989+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s just lame.","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2019-05-28T07:15:47.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lame but probably necessary, still forces the person to build cleanse or QSS though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2019-05-28T12:44:46.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That would likely depend on how easy it would be to counter him.\nRemember that both Zed and Fiora had their ult Cleansed at first but then Riot removed these options because this was too easy of a counter to them and denying them the chance to be played as champions with functioning R keys.\n\nNow, i can already hear some people saying: \"Well, they are already strong champions\".\nBut the argument here is that no champion should play with a part of their kit totally unusable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmenPerson","date":"2019-05-28T12:50:35.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give a source?","replies":[{"poster":"MrZalgo","date":"2019-05-28T18:51:01.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe manute or one of the game testers confirmed it on Twitter or Youtube.
