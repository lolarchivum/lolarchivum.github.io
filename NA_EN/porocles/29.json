Did you realize that the riot support page got updated without being closed for more than 2 months ? they had changed everything before a year or 2 maybe and they updated the submit a ticket page before a short while , so why couldn't they do the same thing with the pbe page , also they did the same thing to their website .... I know they are trying to make it smoother , better and a more friendly sign up process but i think making a \" signup \" page shouldn't take this long unless they are adding more things ( features ) to that page , like a community of its own or a news tab for pbe or  game info or forums or media or competitive or all of them . so i hope riot can finish doing this soon and if it is going to take longer i wish they would tell us when to expect it or what are the features that they are going to add to that page so as we would be able to estimate the time that it is going to take .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sheeporoth","date":"2017-05-02T22:10:37.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rito its been more than a month","replies":[{"poster":"Certified Genius","date":"2017-06-07T21:53:54.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been more than 2 :(","replies":[{"poster":"Disco Zac","date":"2017-08-23T14:59:44.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its been more than 4","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"master person222","date":"2017-05-25T21:38:18.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot hasnt addressed this issue probably because not enough people have brought this issue to them. \nIt would probably recieve more attention if the people reading this comment communicated to riot.\nI woul encourage anyone here to send a ticket in riot support and maybe even ask a question in Ask Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Certified Genius","date":"2017-05-27T06:34:00.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have, I made a short post asking [here.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/qUPOrcEX-cant-sign-up-for-pbe) Every time someone asks a question about the progress, they send the same link [(this one)](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) which hasn't updated the issue since 4/4.
