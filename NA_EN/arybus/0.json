To them League is only a well full of water and once the well is empty they'll just dig a new well somewhere else and the only concern they will ever have for the old well is the fill up the hole so no one falls and gets them in trouble. So my request for Tencent is to help your products be the best they can be and stop trying to suck as much money as you can then ditch it when your done with it. But until you can do that i'm never going to stop saying #FuckTencent\r\n\r\nChinese version: 他们真的不关心联赛的传奇如何成功或多么幸福的玩家基础。对他们来说，联赛是只有一口井满水，一旦井是空的，他们只会打一口新井别的地方，他们永远不会有对老井的唯一担心的是填补了孔，所以没有人跌倒，并得到他们麻烦了。所以，我对腾讯的要求是，以帮助您的产品是他们可以做到最好，并停止尝试吸尽可能多的钱，你就可以抛弃它，当你用它做。但是，直到你能做到这一点我永远不会停止说 #腾讯他妈的","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-04-29T15:55:07.395+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":1,"body":"ur google translate is hurting me","replies":[{"poster":"Victorious Udyr","date":"2016-04-29T17:39:47.638+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Deckowner,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=5xKTBRmq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-29T15:55:07.395+0000)\n>\n> ur google translate is hurting me\n\nThe feels of being cursed to in French from a google translate, and it translate to something about toilets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KANYE OBAMA GOD","date":"2016-04-30T03:49:59.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my Spanish class we had to write about a childhood story, then translate it to Spanish.

It was a blast wile it lasted. Every weekend was packed with events, and you could stop by any time to chat paint or play. I made lot of friends through that game, but sadly games workshop got to fat and greedy. Constant price hikes and lower quality and quantity of models turned off a large portion of the player base. Failure to listen to your clients.
