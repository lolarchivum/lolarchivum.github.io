EVERY LINK, EVERY ICON, EVERY IMAGE AND IDEA BELONG TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS. SOURCES CAN BE ADDED UPON STRONG REQUEST.\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#SOURCE OF INSPIRATION:\n\nThe Idea for this Champion  were taken from a mixture from Ragnaros from WoW and the Hawaiian goddess of Fire and volcano's, Pele, which is also the namesake for this champion.\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#SUGGESTED LOOKS AND THEME:\n\n**LOOKS:**\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/94ih.jpg\n\nFor the Looks, I decided to go with something different than usual. I wanted something a little bit more...edgy. But not too much, don't want kayn to sue me for copyrights.\n\n**THEME:**\n\nFor the Theme, I needed something that was very much like you'd imagine a volcano. A slow-paced, calm beginning, as if nothing is wrong at first, then a small rupture, a steady build up, the situation getting worse as it progresses, and then a big explosion near the end with the calamity setting in as the score settles. So I found this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diMNV6A3_x0\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#AUTHOR'S PHILOSOPHY:\n\nWell, this one is actually quite simple. We have no lava champions to date and it's an interesting element to use for a mage, so I thought I would try it and see how I can make a lava-mage work. I certainly had fun brainstorming this one because all the things you can do. There was a very large range of abilities to discover.\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#RATINGS:\n\n- Damage: 3/3\n\n- Toughness: 1/3\n\n- Crowd Control: 2/3\n\n- Mobility: 0/3\n\n- Utility: 1/3\n\n- **DIFFICULTY:** 2/3\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#SECONDARY INFORMATION:\n\n- Secondary Bar: Mana\n\n- Primary/Secondary Role: Mage/Burst\n\n- Secondary Attribute: Ranged\n\n- Style (Damage): 95% Magic, 5% Physical\n\n- Style (Abilities): 80% Abilities, 20% Auto Attack\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#STATS:\n\n- Health: 530 - 2020 (+87.647/Level)\n\n- Health Regeneration: 5.0 - 15 (+0.588/Level)\n\n- Mana: 480 - 920 (+25.882/Level)\n\n- Mana Regeneration: 11 - 22 (+0.647/Level)\n\n- Range: 500\n\n- Attack Damage: 52 - 100 (+2.824/Level)\n\n- Attack Speed: 0.625 (+0 - 22%)\n\n- Armor: 24 - 80 (+3.294/Level)\n\n- Magic Resistance: 32 - 40 (+0.471/Level)\n\n- Movement Speed: 320\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#KIT:\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/94il.png **PASSIVE ABILITY:** Song of Fuji\nCooldown: 16 Seconds\n\nEvery few Seconds, Pele charges his next Basic Ability to deal an extra 30/60/90/120 (+10/15/20/25% AP) Magic Damage against enemy Champions over 2 seconds and slowing them by 20% over the Duration. \n---\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/94im.png **Q-ABILITY:** Ring of Erta Ale\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 Seconds\nCosts: 50 Mana\nCast Range: 600\nHitbox: 80\nConnection Hitbox: 100\nProjectile Speed: 600/Second\n\nPele fires 2 Lava Bombs in a circle infront of him, dealing 60/90/120/150/180 (+40% AP) Magic Damage to all enemies hit.

As a servant to one of them, he sacrificed his own free will for more power and to better serve the one that granted it to him. Despite having no more free will, he still possessed his emotions which caused his passion for servitude and loyalty to absolutely escalate, for he had, willingly, known no different.\n\nHowever, as all reigns had to end, the Darkins ended up being cast away within their own weapons and their servants either dispersed or died fighting for their powers. Pele, having infused his very being with the Magical Element he used, Lava Magic, was unable to be physically destroyed due to his body turning into Molten Lava, repairing itself fully. And so, like his master, he too was locked away, cast into the deepest pit of the most active known Volcano in Runeterra.\n\nBut in the years of his sentence, he expanded his powers by fueling his own Lava with the natural ressource of a Volcano, and began to slowly weaken his shackles until one day they would break loose. And on that day, Pele swears to rain the unholy wrath of his Lava onto all who opposed him and his Master and to return the Darkins to power, by any means necessary. \n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#A FEW QUOTES:\n\n**PICK:**\n\n- The Hot Spot Boils, an Eruption is near.\n---\n**BAN:**\n\n- This Repose shall be short\n\n---\n**GAME START:**\n\n- The Great Eruption has begun, a Winter of Ash and Death shall clouds this world. \n\n- This world shall know a slow death, choked by the unbreathable air of Phreatic eruptions\n---\n**MEET BRAND FOR THE FIRST TIME:**\n\n- Fool, your fires only strengthen my Lava\n\n- My Lava is hotter than your Fire\n---\n**MEET DARKIN FOR THE FIRST TIME:**\n\n- Fallen one, brother of my Master, rival to his throne. Here and now, you shall fall.\n\n- O great Fallen one, forgive me for what I am about to do.\n\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/8xhg.png\n\n#SUMMARY + EDIT LOG:\n\nI hope you have enjoyed the read, as always. This time, I have taken up some more proper terminologies within the Dialogues and Ability Descriptions, and as such, shall link a Glossary to all of them so you can look them up incase you don't know what they mean and are interested to learn. Below the Glossary, I will hold an Edit Log where all changes will be documented for oversight-purposes.\n\nhttp://midju.tripod.com/glossary.html\n---\n**EDIT LOG:**\n\nEdit 1: \n\n- \"Song of Fuji\" mana-Refund removed; Cooldown reduced from 18 seconds to 16.\n\n- \"Ring of Etra Ale\" rewards sweet spot hits with a slight mana refund. \n\n- \"Wrath of Tambora\" debuff no longer disables secondary ressource regeneration; Slows movement speed and attack speed instead.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-06T02:40:11.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just FYI here, but Pele (Pelé) is the name of a Brazilian soccer player from the 60s.

In the Power-fantasy, this champion does really embody the Idea of a volcano. The longer he plays, the stronger he scales, meaning the more destructive he becomes. His response is delayed, but absolutely devastating and unforgiving, and despite only having flat damage, even the toughest tank will feel the full, destructive capability of a successful rotation.\n\nHowever, the kit in itself is rather simple and, to put it blunt, nothing new (Except for the R) and so the big question is \"Why should I pic this over X champion?\" Because you have competitors, several, who do the same thing he does, by essence, and so he could simply fade based on how meta he is. \n\nOverall kit is good, decently designed, no structural mistakes to spot, but the kit is simple and doesn't offer many new things\n\nP.S: I absolutely LOVE the names, the passive does sound like it could be a genuine Ability, it has a poetic tone to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2019-10-09T17:55:46.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh, some people still pick Annie and she doesn't bring a lot to the table outside a flash R stun. But yeah, he'd fall off pretty hard, building Health or MR both make him pretty useless. I'd maybe add in something to help counter one of those(not both, stupid Vayne), could make his Passive reduce MR for the 2 seconds or do %HP damage. Since he is 100% delayed skill-shot damage.","replies":[]}]}]}
