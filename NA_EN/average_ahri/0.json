Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nRiot used to give toxic players a long series of gradually-increasing suspensions. However, they found that players who got more than a few punishments would never stop misbehaving and receiving punishments. As the goal of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking and Riot has absolutely no interest in coddling toxic players, the system was changed to eliminate this long tail of irredeemable players. Compared to the hundreds or even thousands of typical players who are bothered over dozens or hundreds of matches ruined by a toxic player, that one player's ability to annoy people merits no sympathy or concern. The preferred outcome of punishing a misbehaving player is reform: according to Riot's figures, most players who get one punishment never get another. However, when a player refuses to stop breaking the rules after a few warnings (punishments), they are removed from the game with a permaban because Riot no longer believes them capable of reform.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinful Succubus","date":"2019-11-07T08:17:08.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually the problem with the stacking chat restrictions wasn't so much the way they'd abuse the loopholes, but the fact that people were **collecting the chat restrictions like they currently collect mastery points**\n\nit was quite hilarious tbh. \n\nit wasn't uncommon to know someone with 1k+ chat restrictions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-11-07T02:12:57.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">This is a suggestion but i think perma ban should be removed and replace by an ever increasing ban time.

Even if we assume that's true (which is a stretch by itself), that's not a sensible argument for a change to be made. In fact, if **you** actually thought they were the same, you hardly would have created this thread.\n\n>There's also a second thing i want to point out. We change as time passes so 1-2 years later our personality might shift into a more mellow way.\n\nThis is the only thing you write which actually offers some support to the idea of year long bans as a replacement for permabans… and it's honestly not the best argument. Just because your personality has changed doesn't mean any consequences from your prior decisions vanish. At that point the mature thing to do is accept responsibility for the actions of your past self and, if you still want to play lol, simply create a new account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-07T01:04:38.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Meaning league will one day become irrelevant, an object of the past.\n\nWhile sure, this is *possible*, there are many games that maintain playerbases (and even unofficial support) for dozens of years. Look at roller coaster tycoon, the sim city series, and many other games that have gone well over 10 years and maintain a relatively stable (but smaller than peak) playerbase. The future possibility the game ceases to exist is not a factor in deciding how to maintain the game today.\n\n>Our sentiments are whats giving our accounts meaning.

That's why a ban of such length is as significant as permanently banning an account.\n\nSo you're saying that because it *may* not be a thing in 2 years, a 2 year ban is akin to a permanent ban because everyone's going to sit here and think \"well, it may not be around so it's as good as gone\"? That's a... fairly abstract and uncommon train of thought. While it may be your train of thought, most people will think \"welp, got banned again, time to hop on another account and set a reminder on my phone/google/apple account/whatever for 2 years to go back to my normal\".\n\nFurthermore, what would this say to people who get a 2 year ban and are able to come back to their account? It'd say that Riot will never permanently remove someone - which is contrary to their goal. Riot does not want people coming back, ever, at all, when they're permanently banned.\n\n>There's also a second thing i want to point out. We change as time passes so 1-2 years later our personality might shift into a more mellow way.\n\nRiot has run currently two separate experiments separated by a couple years where they unbanned accounts that had been banned in some cases for multiple years. The first of these had over a 95% failure rate (i.e. over 95% of players kept misbehaving), and the second abruptly stopped enrolling people and there has been no changes from it, suggesting it was a similar result.\n\nSure, some may change. But the bottom line is that most people who are toxic in a video game to the point of a permanent ban will never get out of their mindset that \"it's behind a screen\" and \"there's no harm done\" and \"it's okay because i'm frustrated\" and the like.","replies":[{"poster":"Average Ahri","date":"2019-11-11T20:39:05.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't we draw a parallel here. Death sentence versus prison time. Perma ban is equivalent of a death sentence on your account. If and its a BIG if your statistic is right and 95% of player that were permaed resume their toxic ways. Then they would immediately be banned again with their sentence doubled. So 2years. Now if an account is locked for 2years then it is effectively lost. Now i dont want to use anecdotal evidence but i do have a friend with over 40account banned. Everytime he gets banned he goes on to buy a new one. The result are the same. If you lose your account permanently or you lose your account for a tremendous amount of time. You are fully capable of buying yourself a new one. While my way would allow redemption and is way more consumer friendly.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-11T21:09:24.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely not.\n\nA death sentence **literally results in the death of the person**. There is no do-over. They can't go play another game. They can't move on and still have their life.\n\nThe fact you think that a permanent ban from a video game is equivalent to a death sentence is appalling.\n\nLastly, Riot does not **care** about being \"friendly\" to people who are toxic and break the rules. Riot isn't here to be your friend. Riot doesn't **want** toxic players to play the game, so of course they aren't going to do things to encourage/make it easier for them to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Average Ahri","date":"2019-11-11T21:33:36.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beg to differ, the emotional, monetary and time invested can be quite significant. Unless you deny the fact that a life is finite. You have to agree that if someone spent 8years on an account. It hurts quite much to lose it. Im simply saying that giving a second chance isn't necessarily a bad idea. Now Riot doesnt need to be our friends but it has every incentive to treat us well. Consumer backlash is a real thing.(ea bethesda) you can treat it as a give give scenario. If a company treats its customer with basic form of leniency and respect. The feeling will be reciprocal.
