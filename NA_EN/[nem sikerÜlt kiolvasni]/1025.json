The threat posed was to great to ignore.\r\nHer reputation far preceded her, and even though her line of work was generally more supernatural, she believed this case demanded an exception.\r\nThe Spider Queen's reign of terror had gone on long enough.\r\nThe information had been delivered by an interesting source.\r\nFor some time she had suspected his betrayal of Noxus, but she didn't believe it until Renegade Talon (260 RP) actually appeared at her doorstep to supply her with news.\r\nAfter recovering from his shock at her appearance, he told her his tale.\r\nHe had been stalking a Noxian party through the shadow isles, waiting for the moment to strike down the leader when he saw a congregation lead by Elise (487 RP).\r\nThe source of her power had always been a subject of curiosity, so using his talents, he endeavored to find out.\r\nWhat he saw horrified him, and he knew that she must be stopped.\r\nWith this in mind, Heartseeker Vayne (487 RP) knew she needed the best team. The ever willing Full Metal Rammus (487 RP) pledged his aid, even promising to don his best and most protective suit for the occasion, as well as the monolith completely opposed to agents of disharmony.\r\nMalphit (292 RP).\r\nThe plan was simple, she would go ahead using her skills as the night hunter to scout. She would then report to Full Metal Rammus and Malphite, who would dash into the fight, causing a distraction while she took the shot with her silver arrow.\r\nAs she approached the cave, she saw something that sickened her.\r\n\"Trundle....\" (440 RP) she muttered.\r\n\"So then we agree,\" said Trundle \"you will pledge your powers and your followers to our cause during the war.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"go tell Lissandra that the might of the spider god stands behind her in all it's terrible glory.\"\r\nThis added an extra complication, but it was too late to go back.\r\nShe headed back to alert her companions of the new danger, but Full Metal Rammus was unfazed. In fact, his only response was a cool \"OK\".\r\nThat being said, it was time to strike.\r\nHeading in first, Malphite smashed into the cave wall, blocking off the entrance to delay interference from the spider God. He then turned to engage a dazed Trundle.\r\nComing in from behind, Full Metal Rammus dashed in, taunting the trundle into madly attacking him while his metal spikes were extended.\r\nThen came Heartseeker Vayne.\r\nShe silently rolled into the battle, and Elise didn't see her until the heavy bolt condemned her to the cave wall.\r\n\"You better hope your Spider God's magic is as great as you believe,\" said Heartseeker Vayne, \"because this is going to hurt.\"\r\nLoading up the silver bolt, she fired straight for the heart, but Trundle raised a wall of ice just in time, shaving off half the bolt. \r\nThe half that hit did damage, but not enough to kill.\r\nFreeing herself from the bolt pinning her to the wall, Elise swapped into spider form, launching exploding spiders at her opponents to confuse them, then climbed up on a web into the trees to escape.\r\nFollowing her lead, trundle created an arena of ice and sprinted straight out.\r\nFull Metal Rammus was ready to follow but Heartseeker Vayne put a hand on his shoulder and told him to stop.\r\n\"We've done our job, they won't be bothering anyone for a good while.\"\r\nThey also had some good intel to take back to Damacia about the impending Freljordian invasion.","replies":[{"poster":"Silersun","date":"2014-10-24T01:36:41.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Yes,\" she replied, \"go tell Lissandra that the might of the spider god stands behind her in all it's terrible glory.\"\r\n\r\n... its*\r\nAnd she is a Spider Queen.\r\nNonetheless, this was entertaining.
