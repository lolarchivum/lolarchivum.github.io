We've been working on a few thing that will come before Taric and are deep in production or have high-priority in pre-production for various reasons. Currently, and Scruffy can probably speak better to this, but his new kit looks like it's shaping up nicely. For us on the art side, that's huge. We can have much more narrow of a focus now that we know specific actions a champion will take and how we build the character around those actions. \n\nCurrently Narrative is helping us on high-priority stuff that's in pre-production. They sort of occupy the same area that Concept does because they help formulate the very core of the character. We think that Taric will be a big discussion in the \"near future\". Sorry that's so ambiguous. \n\nThat said, we have about 30 concepts of Taric from various artists. This however was done in a bit of a vacuum, back when we were moving in a direction that we really hadn't validated properly, a very much straight-forward dude in blue armor and gems. Since then, the casual discussions around him between art, gameplay and narrative aspects are aligning around something with a slightly different flavor than what we had originally anticipated, and that's good. When the official ideation sessions strike up again I think we'll have a good spring board. Narrative helps tremendously in those discussions because we want to understand what made Taric into Taric and what his current pillars of design are.\n\nLikewise, having gameplay in place really helps as well because we're not designing in a vacuum, we're working towards the goals of fulfilling the needs of that gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-02-13T07:25:10.164+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronStylus,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=gEKAkdFJ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-13T07:17:22.483+0000)\n>\n> Currently Narrative is helping us on high-priority stuff that's in pre-production.

Sorry that's so ambiguous. \n\nI think it would be great if Narrative followed your example and held some meaningful discussions on Taric with the community as they decide where they're going with him. It would be a marked change from their current modus operandi, but there have been hints that they're coming around. I've definitely noticed them trying to make new material more backwards-compatible, for instance, and they're at least sort of making token efforts at \"what Champions do you want to talk about\" threads. I wasn't sure what to make of this.\n\nA major rework of a character like Taric is a fantastic opportunity for Narrative to really make good on these preliminary gestures and have some genuine community discussion—to treat the community not just as a passive audience but as a source of ideas and alternate viewpoints. I mentioned the community discussion threads you did for Taric on the art side. I thought that was a good discussion, and judging from your comments it sounds like you did get some good ideas and feedback from it. (Of course, we also came to better appreciate your ideas. I took particular note of your observation that people were at first too quick to basically make him into one big \"fabulous\" joke, which was not only unsatisfying but, when you think about it, really kind of demeaning.) It is, as always, our honor to assist our glorious parrot sovereign. I think my contribution was a picture of Richard Gere from First Knight, as a way for him to be \"beautiful\" while still having a lot of maturity and strength, rather than either going totally bishounen or just making him another big buff dude.\n\nhttps://mutantreviewers.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/first_knight.jpg\n*Magic has ruined this land. Now I will stare soulfully into the distance.*\n\nIsn't that how Riot works? You ask about Taric. You see a bunch of ideas. One of them is my idea for Taric. Maybe you love it, and adopt it. Maybe you hate it, and realizing how much you hate it helps inspire you with a completely opposite concept. Maybe it's just one of many ideas that are appealing in some ways and unappealing in others, and together help you come up with what you really want to see. Whatever the case, I think threads like those are enriching, and help anchor Riot in its community.\n\nI know, I know. I probably misconstrued your post. I shouldn't even be posting; I told myself I'd stop wasting time trying to reach out to Narrative. But I feel so weird about simultaneously liking them and dreading them that I can't help myself. Sometimes, a situation is just so crazy that you can't stop trying to do something about it. And ever since the Great Retcon, I've been like:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DEfnmbE.gif\n*No more League of Legends in League of Legends?*  \n*Rioters refusing to talk with their own community?* \n*FELLOW SUMMONERS, HAVE I QUAFFED THE ELIXIR OF MADNESS?*","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-02-13T08:00:40.180+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you seen the three big threads I posted about Taric a while ago?

That seemed to be a productive conversation.\n\nWell, there is a major difference between you (including some people at ChampUp) and Narrative.\n\nYou interact with those interested in the champions you're scheduled / planning on reworking.  Gathering fan opinions on how they feel a champion should exist within the game world.  This is awesome and should be encouraged, even if you don't use any of our ideas at all.  \n\n(Sorry if I trundle through this.  I'm trying to get everything out and it's too early in the morning as I type this).\n\nNarrative, on the other hand, doesn't bother trying to do any of that.  They seem to think that they know these champions better than we do and are somehow above community interaction.  In the past three months, the amount of interaction we've seen from Narrative has dwindled down to a handful of posts along with one pinned thread where they also say they can't read story suggestions for \"legal\" reasons.   That last one was a full week ago.  When some of us asked about an explanation for these \"legal reasons,\" they went back into their silent mode.  So much for \"we want to communicate,\" eh?\n\nIn other words, Parrot, you are an example of how a developer should talk with their fans... Narrative is the one department within Riot that shits on the \"we're all about our community\" ideals, intentionally or not.\n\nSo, when you post...\n\n> Currently Narrative is helping us on high-priority stuff that's in pre-production. They sort of occupy the same area that Concept does because they help formulate the very core of the character. We think that Taric will be a big discussion in the \"near future\". Sorry that's so ambiguous. \n\n..that doesn't bode well for us lore fans who would have loved an opportunity to have a discussion about Taric before anything was set in concrete.  Jaredan keeps *saying* that he wants to communicate with us more, but I'm just not seeing any effort directed towards that and don't really think he has any desire to so.\n\nI'm sorry that I've had to bring this up in this thread, Parrot, but Narrative just isn't listening to us (once again) and we're desperate for attention.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-02-14T09:27:38.067+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not as clear cut as that.  You're talking about a discipline versus a team.\n\nYou want a specific conversation on a broad subject base with a discipline, one that's spread across 3 content teams and then some. That's pretty much the same thing as \"The concept team doesn't interact with us and we want a stake in how concepts are developed, so Concept team, come tell us what's up, put your cards on the table.\" Well, Concept is spread across 3 content teams and then some also. You wouldn't get much consensus nor would anything be able to be directly communicated from a central source.\n\nNarrative doesn't flow from some high waterfall for the content teams to lap up in the pond. It's a discipline matrixed into various teams, Champion, ChampUP, Events, etc. Yes, there are some teams, such as the team Ant is on which create some foundational pillars for the IP in-game and beyond, but that information, even coming from the foundations aspect isn't a handed-down writ. Each content team is using Narrative as a resource to be allocated and to utilize as a service of sorts, not treat it as a central spigot source of lore. Narrative doesn't operate in a black box, we work directly with them and in a pretty meaningful way, especially on ChampUP. We're really the only content team that can funnel refreshed and updated characters into the game experience and therefore become canon. But they're not handing out some sort of doctrine, we're conversing back and forth.\n\nSo, when you're asking to be involved, and here I come asking about Taric, there's your chance! I'm taking feedback not just on art, but on themes, tropes, stories and more. I represent a team you're going to get a product from and I can speak from that standpoint and possibly, depending on circumstance, where directionally Narrative is helping us move. This very board is for Story and Art for a reason. They're very intertwined. \n\nWill I be able to say everything? Heck no. But that's not anything new. I can talk about what we're exploring, just like how Gameplay can tell you about how a kit is coming along or about future plans to adjust balance. I can talk to you in the same way that any sort of pre-production person can. \n\n> Narrative, on the other hand, doesn't bother trying to do any of that. They seem to think that they know these champions better than we do and are somehow above community interaction. \n\nThis actually really bugs me. Do you know who's ultimately responsible for updated content going out? ChampUP. We also coordinate with Events and other departments on projects such the Freljord and Shurima events. Indeed, there might be things filled in here and there by Narrative as a discipline, large scale sequential story-telling, or general updates on IP building and world creation, but our team is the one handing  you the new thing that's replacing the old thing. If you're going to accuse anyone of disregarding your sentiments, then go ahead and accuse me if you'd really like to place blame. I'm part of the team that is indeed changing champions which sometimes creates friction with the community. But even that is a decision made by the content team that's putting out the work, not some sort of voice from the clouds telling us what to do. \n\nMyself, I do come to the community to gather information and seek feedback. If you'd like to direct the questions my way, I'm happy to answer where I can, in the context of what content my team produces.

We trust that they're able craftsmen. I trust that about Narrative because I work with them. They're some of the smartest, level-headed people I know who care for depth and breadth in story. I'm a lover of story myself and prefer to develop characters that have a compelling core. It's exhilarating working with them. And yes, it is a dialogue. \n\nI won't be able to divulge everything, but I can certainly tell you that the things the community talks about are resonant in that department and make it into the feedback loop. When ChampUP in particular is working on a project we're heavily invested into what the player perception is and how we can preserve yet enhance it. They're in the same frame of mind, but damn, do they have a task in front of them. I don't envy them. But what can I do?

Other departments don't have a problem seeking fan input or just starting a conversation, from Game Balance to Skins to Art.\n\nIt seems that when it comes to Narrative, however, they just release things (*Freljord, Retcon*), make false apologies (*we're sorry we didn't say anything*), make promises to change (*we will start communicating more*) then completely ignore their vows (months or years of silence).\n\nSo, when we see Jaredan and some of the people on Narrative spend more time on Twitter talking up their weekly Dungeons and Dragons game than they would ever consider using to interact with their fans, it's beyond frustrating.\n \n> So, when you're asking to be involved, and here I come asking about Taric, there's your chance!

That's obvious given your chosen discipline.  If I recall correctly, however, there wasn't a \"where do you see Taric's story\" part in your suggestions threads.  Had I known you wanted story suggestions as well as art references, I would have gladly provided them.  I'm just afraid that even in this early point in the process, any suggestions I have may be a case of \"too little, too late.\"\n \n> This actually really bugs me.

Is your team the reason why the new updated bios haven't been delivered as promised?  Does ChampUp tell Narrative to tie in every new story to a champ release or rework and also why Singed's back story has remained broken for almost two and a half years?\n\nChampUp is the reason why Narrative keeps repeating this cycle of making big promises then breaking them and treating us with silence?  Is this what you're telling us?  I don't think you want to be responsible for all that.\n\n>If you're going to accuse anyone of disregarding your sentiments, then go ahead and accuse me if you'd really like to place blame.

It's so frustrating and infuriating that we would need to have non-Narrative Rioters like yourself, Riot Sweet and so many others have to come in and ping people from Narrative when they should be doing that on their own.\n\nInstead, we're getting mostly silence from Narrative.  Silence and warnings to not offer story and character suggestions for undisclosed or unspecified \"legal reasons.\"\n \n> I'm never going to drag someone \"kicking and screaming\" in here, that's not the answer, and that would be pretty rude of me to assume I can do their job better than they can.

They give you a reason to trust them and to continue to trust them.\n\nI *don't* trust them because they keep making promises and breaking them.  From the removal of the Journals of Justice to the Freljord disasters to the Retcon announcement ***after a year and a half of silence*** to this latest period with Jaredan and Ant, the cycle of making and breaking promises continues.\n\nAdditionally, Narrative *won't* give me a reason to trust them even though they keep asking for my trust.  Also, since **my** trust in them isn't necessary for them to do their job, there's no real reason why they would even bother trying to earn it, Riot Games policies or not.\n \n> I won't be able to divulge everything, but I can certainly tell you that the things the community talks about are resonant in that department and make it into the feedback loop.

We had a great meeting today about some future content we're making and it has us all super excited.

I'm glad you're having a wonderful time with Narrative, but this sort of thing is **exactly** why our frustration grows.\n\nJust about every other department at Riot Games, from Game Balance to Skins, has some example of how fan interaction shaped a piece of content *before* it was released.  Narrative, however, does not and I've been a League lore fan for over three years.  I don't know why this is but it just adds sadness to my \"emotion salad\" concerning Narrative.\n \n> I would urge you to default to trust, but I understand your position, the history you've witnessed and the feeling of being left out.\n\nTrust?  To quote Inigo Montoya.  *\"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\"*\n\nIt's not a \"feeling\" of being left out.  We **have** been left out of the conversation.  With one exception (Udyr and Ionia), where was fan input and ideas addressed with the removal of the Journal of Justice, League Judgement and the Freljord changes?  Where were fan ideas collected and addressed before the Retcon announcement last September?  \n\nGive me a reason to trust you and, maybe, I will.  I'll go out on a limb and suggest most Lore fans would agree with that sentiment.\n \n> In any case, I'm always up to hear ideas, field questions where I can and generally be of help when possible.\n\nSuggestion, then:  Start a new thread asking \"What should Taric's story be?,\" let it stew for a week on the boards, then send the suggestions over to Narrative and Foundations for their opinions.  That is, if \"legal reasons\" won't stop them from doing so.\n\nFrankly, that's how it should be for every champion, but we're talking about Taric here.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-02-14T23:39:58.557+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to talk sometime in client we can do that.

I'd like to see how those look.\" That's kind of an awkward example, but I hope it illustrates the point—that Narrative is not locked away in some weird black box.\n\nTo be honest, I guess to some extent I was assuming that Narrative's relationship with other Rioters was comparable to its relationship with the community—a frustratingly one-way and non-interactive process by which lore is \"handed down from on high\".\n\n> Will I be able to say everything? Heck no. But that's not anything new. I can talk about what we're exploring, just like how Gameplay can tell you about how a kit is coming along or about future plans to adjust balance. I can talk to you in the same way that any sort of pre-production person can.\n\nThis is basically what we've been asking for. We are not, repeat **not**, asking to have this put to a vote. That would be crazy for many reasons, not least that we represent a small (though I believe uncommonly invested) fraction of the playerbase, and because I've tried design-by-democracy myself in some of my personal projects, and it failed miserably. (By \"design-by-democracy\", I mean specifically putting every. last. thing. to a vote. It made me painfully aware of the importance of some executive force that can discuss and collaborate, but also at the end of the day make a decision that has some continuity with the overall vision.) What we're asking for is what Riot does in many other areas, and what you've done with Taric (mostly on art, but I think there was some story discussion there, too) and others.\n\nWhat I'm asking for is really just what you describe. That at certain times in the development process, you come by, share some of the ideas you're exploring (especially those that would radically contradict established lore/theme—which is not a bad thing, but is a potentially dangerous thing), and discuss with the community, using us as a sort of focus group. I really enjoyed that discussion on Taric, for example: what's his core identity? Is he an angry smiter-paladin? Is he a healer who doesn't really need to be carrying a weapon in the first place? Is he a protector? Is he morose, or just quiet? Those questions are ultimately yours to answer, but I think that we often have some things to say that are worth listening to, and even when we don't, I get the impression that sometimes batting ideas around with us helps your own creative thinking. And, on the \"negative\" side, it does sometimes serve an important \"emergency brake\" function, when you don't realize just how unhappy we'd be with a particular change. (\"Whoa, we didn't realize that people actually LIKED that part of the character.\") Not that we have a veto, but I think, yeah, sometimes it's important to do a sweep and see if anything jumps out as extremely objectionable. In such cases, maybe it can be trivially changed. Maybe the problem is that we don't get it, and it can be explained, or clarified. Or maybe we do get it, and we just sharply disagree, and then it's up to you to make that decision while aware of the disagreement. Unpopular changes can be great changes. But I think it's good to at least hear the opposition out first.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-02-14T23:44:57.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad I could be of help.

Do you know who's ultimately responsible for updated content going out? ChampUP. We also coordinate with Events and other departments on projects such the Freljord and Shurima events. Indeed, there might be things filled in here and there by Narrative as a discipline, large scale sequential story-telling, or general updates on IP building and world creation, but our team is the one handing  you the new thing that's replacing the old thing. If you're going to accuse anyone of disregarding your sentiments, then go ahead and accuse me if you'd really like to place blame. I'm part of the team that is indeed changing champions which sometimes creates friction with the community. But even that is a decision made by the content team that's putting out the work, not some sort of voice from the clouds telling us what to do.\n\nAlright, then let's talk about those recent events.\n\nFreljord first. Did you come talk to us about the lore changes to Ashe, Tryndamere, or Gragas? I don't remember you doing so. I remember Trundle being deleted while a frost brute was introduced, but that was after someone else came to chat. You and I even talked about that incident 1-on-1 in the LoL client, and we agreed very easily that the backlash he got was far too extreme and I believed you when you said he never intentionally lied. So, okay, some amount of discussion happened, but it wasn't very thorough and it didn't actually lead to a change in plans, so far as we could see.\n\nShurima? I remember you coming to talk about Sivir. Lots of discussion there. She's a merc, she's ruthless, she wants money, she's a bit older and tougher than the other ladies of League. That back-and-forth led to her having that raspy voice and casual confidence, while her kit stayed thematically untouched. Her character was clarified, through dialogue, and she became a more unique identity because of that. A better one, too, in my opinion. I still dislike her base splash art, but that's such a minor thing compared to how right everything else was there. Xerath's kit got discussed at length, too, with Xelnath showing an incredible level of dedication to making the character shine. How often do we cheer at Bjergsen making highlight plays? Isn't Xerath a good example of a champion with clear strengths, clear weaknesses, and cool play patterns throughout? That was awesome! His character, on the other hand, was not discussed, and he went from an arcane genius searching for greater power to a slave-turned-nuke. Lore fans and Xerath fans weren't huge on that, from the discussions I saw, but the change went right through anyway. Skarner also lost almost the entirety of his lore, without discussion, while Nasus and Renekton luckily only got shifted a bit to accommodate the rest. Also something went on with Ezreal, not sure what's up with that. So, stuff that did get discussed went well as changes made incorporated feedback, while everything else led to yet more distrust.\n\nSion got talked about at length, right? How he barely had a character, how his history as a Noxian was actually interesting and usable, how we wanted him to feel like a proper undead monstrosity and a moving wall? Well, damn, that nail got hit on the head so hard my ears are still ringing. Gorgeous lore delivery, fitting very nicely with what existed before while providing more intrigue, and new Sion is frankly fantastic on basically every level.\n\nMeanwhile, Cassi gets sent through a laundry machine, and while the gal who came out still has the same parts I think it's obvious many fans saw just how broken and wrong she'd become. Worse, her presence in LCS play probably means this new kit is sticking around for the long haul, made without proper discussion and left despite criticism. A lot of truly terrible hate-spewing as well, which should never happen, but the disgusting actions of some do not make Stashioppeia a good thing.\n\nSo, see, we can't really blame you. In fact, you're one of those who deserves quite the opposite of blame. Sivir getting changed? We talked. It was great. Sion getting changed? We talked. It was great. You keep talking, we keep replying, and it keeps going well. The people being blamed here are the ones who don't talk, then utterly bulldoze old beloved content. Who was in charge of deleting Skarner's lore? Who decided that Trundle would work better as a new character? Who felt it fine to redefine Cassi's gameplay as AP ADC? Those discussions should have happened, too, but they didn't. If you were the primary influence on all of that as well, then yes, that's blame being placed on you, but that doesn't seem to be the case. You're the one who talks. Or squawks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-02-14T16:08:09.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, at least a bunch of Jaredan's comments about how they can't talk about future stories without stepping on several other team's toes makes sense now...\n\nBut honestly?

Do you know who's ultimately responsible for updated content going out? ChampUP. \n\nSo... I can question you why Trundles character got replaced? Why Xeraths main motivation and modus operandi got changed? Because I think these changes shouldn't be done. I shouldn't be fearing for my favorite characters. I should be excited if a story comes out with them in it, not fearing if they are a new character now.\n\nI'm not too knowledgable about Xerath, only the basics, but I do know about Trundle. I wouldn't've minded him as a frost troll leader. His old character could've been that almost without any changes. But Riot did decide to just replace his character with a new one that fit the story you had in mind seamlessly, instead of making him a curious fit but not changing his character.\n\n***\nWhy Trundle is different in short (feel free to skip this if you already know):\n\nOld Trundle would've tried to aid his tribe, venture for the weapon and come back, expecting to be hailed as a hero. He'd then probably find out his tribe is just a bunch of, well, unpleasant selfish trolls. However, without institute, he'd have nowhere to go. If he left, he'd just be killed by some humans. He becomes the cynical troll I know.\n\nThe new Trundle however, goes back to his tribe, is hailed as a hero and becomes powerhungry rather than cynical. Now his new VO oozes this powerhunger in about a third of his lines. It's one of his main traits, next to violent and sadistic (common troll traits). \n\nHe also isn't represented as a runt. He loses to the old chieftain, but the first line of his lore already describes him as a hulking troll and we have no other trolls to compare him to. This seems quite a change from the leprous runt.\n\n***\n\nIt just looks to me Riot tried to keep his character intact at first, but then just gave up and made a new troll instead. This could happen to anyone. \nIs Skarner going to be a ferocious beast? Is Veigar no longer going to be an mad evil yordle with noble goals? Will Teemo no longer be a cold-hearted killer putting on a happy mask? Will Cho'Gath no longer be an intelligent monster?\n\nI'd like to enjoy the lore, but if characters can just be discarded like that, why should I care about these characters? I don't want to feel like I did when I saw the new Trundle again. I didn't play Trundle for a month after and I wouldn't play him at all hadn't I still had his old and limited VO.\n\nWorst thing is, there might be fans of the new troll. It's been so long I can't reasonably ask you to remove the new troll in favor of Trundle because that'd be removing *another* character.\n\n***\n\nSo can I ask you about the removal of characters in favor of others, Ironstylus? Can I ask you why one of my favorite characters was just removed and replaced? Can I ask you if you are ok with me fearing for my other favorites? Can I ask you if I'm being unreasonable here?\n\nCan I ask you if I will ever be able to just carelessly enjoy Leagues lore again?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-02-13T16:13:35.469+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TerraRising,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=gEKAkdFJ,comment-id=0002000000000001,timestamp=2015-02-13T14:27:35.537+0000)\n> \n> I'm sorry that I've had to bring this up in this thread, Parrot, but Narrative just isn't listening to us (once again) and we're desperate for attention.\n\nGood post, but if I may offer my two cents: let's stop being so desperate for attention.

While I can't speak for anyone else, I know my biggest barrier to the discussions is that although I can draw and sketch ideas, all the art I do is non-digital. My personal preferences in medium and the lack of a scanner near me makes it amazingly difficult to adequately relay what I'm seeing as possibilities. I don't think flooding your offices with hard copies of art is the solution either, so it means I have to look to sources from the internet and other games and say, \"well, like this armor but not really because it should be different...\" That's a very awkward exchange for me. I certainly wouldn't walk into my tattoo artist's parlor like that, and I don't like to do it to you guys either. I don't have a good solution, other than keeping up the way we have, which flooding forums with pictures and asking you to blend them so they make sense. But I think it's a lot of why the process is taking so long.","replies":[]}]}
