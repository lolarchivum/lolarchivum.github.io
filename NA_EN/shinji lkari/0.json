Ahri, Annie, Kennen, Ekko, and Vlad don't build RoA,they build protobelt an item that grants similar stats and the ability to dodge her binding.

Aurelion bulds the GLP, Rylais, and Liandry's,  which also gives enough in stats to avoid being oneshot.\n\nIf Xerath, Vel'koz, or Azir are playing in range to be at risk of getting Lux combo, they aren't playing correctly as they are long range mages that should be played at a range far enough to easily dodge Lux's binding. They also all build zhonyas with azir and xerath building rylais and maybe liandrys. \n\nClose range mages like ori, syndra, vik, and veigar will typically have a zhonyas in mid game and will def should have both a zhonyas and GA in late game, making it impossible for Lux to combo them. Yasuo should really only be played top, and vs a burst ap mid any AD champ mid would be stupid to not by a hexdrinker or rush a nights vow early. \n\nMalz and Zyra were forced into support because of the nerfs they received for having overloaded kits that dealt too much damage for being as safe as they were, both need a rework, Malz especially so, and should be excluded from midlane balance discussions. \n\nIn short, Lux is an early game noob stomper that punishes players poor positioning and poor itemization.

Xerath needs to land potentially 8 skillshots to land his combo, Lux needs to hit a Q, and she's golden.\n\nAdditionally Xerath's ult has 3/4/5 shots and Arcane Barrage has a 0.8 second cooldown between casts, not affected by Cooldown Reduction.  That means it takes 2.1/2.9/3.7 seconds (after factoring in the delay between casting it and when you can cast the first barrage) of him rooting himself in place for him to even get all of his shots off, not to mention the additional travel time of the projectiles.  Add this to him needing to charge Q for at least 1.5-3 seconds to get the max range on it (which also slows him btw) and you'll realize his .5-2 second stun even without any tenacity is barely enough time to charge a Q the minimum it needs for full effectiveness, and does not give any time for his W, or the almost 4 seconds it would take with perfect reaction time to use his ult.  \n\nUnless you somehow chain CC the target for 6+ seconds Xerath will not land a full combo.  If you get hit by 1 Q, if Lux has mana you're eating her full combo.\n\nEDIT: Lux has 4 damaging spells as well, you can't forget her passive.  If she Q -> auto -> E -> ult -> autos she procs her passive 3 times which gives up to 570 + .6AP\n\nThe full combo at max level is 250 + .7AP + 240 + .6AP + 500 + .75aP + 570 + .6AP [Note, in such a rotation, if she has less than 500 AP (say a support Lux or something) her passive will hit harder than her ult] plus a 480 + 1.2 AP shield that can potentially be applied not just to herself but her whole team, thus its potential value is actually 2400 + 6.0 AP which by itself is ridiculous. \n\nStill, just damage comparison, her total damage is 1560 + 2.65AP and she negates 480 + 1.2 of her AP of the damage she would receive.\n\nXerath's combo is 240 + .75 AP + 180 + .6AP + 200 + .45AP + 1300 + 2.15AP  (260 + .43) a potential of five times\nThis totals 620 + 1.8AP + up to 1300 + 2.15AP.  If he lands literally everything, all 8 skill shots over more than 6 seconds, he'll do 1920 + 3.95 \n\nAssuming for sake of argument that they have the same AP, how about 800 since its assuming level 18?  If they were dueling, Lux's shield would take his damage down to 1440 + 2.75(800) or 3,640 while she would deal 1560 + 2.65(800) or 3680.  \n\nThey would need 1200 AP for Xerath to break even, despite his combo taking a full three times as long.

Mages buy sorc. pen boots because it's one of the only sources of mpen and a really effective one at that. In fact, Sorcerer Shoes are taken 10 times more on mid lane Lux than Ionian Boots of Lucidity and have a higher winrate. Not every game will have a burst ad threat (only really Talon/Zed fit here) and again she's losing out on kill potential by doing so. Lux's don't build abyssal 3rd either, because it's honestly just bad on a mage that needs to 100-0 with her combo (in fact, it has a 43% winrate in general on the champion).  Also, most games are already decided by the point she would reach such a low cooldown and it's very possible she wouldn't reach level 16 by that point either. Essentially, while the buff looks awesome in some ways, practically this isn't much at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2017-03-22T10:41:33.150+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shinji lkari,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZEYEax81,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-03-21T22:14:57.008+0000)\n>\n> It is unfair to every other mid mage on the summoner&amp;#039;s rift.
