She literally has no counterplay. She easily beats out tanks with her ult with little to no consequence.  Only champs I&#039;ve managed to beat her with were skarner and Irelia, barely, with Irelia ended up not being able to do much afterwards late game. Every time I go against her I feel as though I've already lost cause of how much she wins trades and by the time she hits 6 almost no way to 1v1 her which is know is what she is designed to be.  With riposte can even go mid lane and stomp on apcarries and not even worry.  A low cooldown  dash that she can never miss as long as it is in range of the enemy champ also by lvl 13 its a permaslow that you can never get away from which makes it even worse.  People say she isn&#039;t very good in team fights but that is bullshit.  She can easily bypass most champs and go in straight for your carry or even go straight for your tank, even built as a tank she does a good bit of damage to tanks, and literally destroy his health within a second and then her heal comes in helping her team.  Her passive happens way too often and even half the time the proc comes up right in front of her almost always will giving her a freebie that she can get just by using her dash within range of the  proc and walking away.    I know that you can walk away and come back to get the proc to another position but it doesn&#039;t matter.  Why doesn&#039;t it matter,  cause she has a slow that will help her to run up to that proc and then the next one will come in soon afterwards with no downtime no cooldown unlike Quinn&#039;s passive.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion would be to put a cooldown on her passive it is too convient for her to be able to have it always come up every second and besides she has an ult which gives her true damage.  This will also allow some actual counter play at lvls 1-5.  \n\nAnother suggestion is to take away her movement speed on her ult.  Why does she get both a slowing debuff and movement speed buff it makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"55976771DEL2","date":"2016-11-30T13:39:52.379+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Fiora isn't in need to be tuned down.

Those are her pros, trying to challenge her directly in the places she is strong is not the most efficient strategy compared to abusing her weaknesses.\n\nHer cons include weaknesses to ranged poke, contributing nothing in a siege, not being able to provide initiation or disengagement while eating up a spot where your team could be running a tank, having a difficult time getting her ult off in teamfights where the enemy has a lot of movement speed or cc, being a spell reliant melee glass cannon who burns through mana very quickly when committing to any fight or trade longer than a single q, requiring mechanical execution on a consistent basis to perform which adds unreliability to her play pattern (she could easily lose fights she has the kit and stats to win because of minor mechanical mistakes), and being shut down super hard in some very popular lane matchups like pantheon, kennen, and quin.\n\nShe has a small handful of situations where she is very strong, and a larger set of situations where she doesn't provide much use unless you choose to go out of your way to fight her on her own terms.

It's simply not a smart idea to try to duel a Fiora if you aren't sure you can outplay her.  She is very punishing, that's sort of her thing.\n\nThat being said.. if the enemy forces a farm lane, there's really nothing I can do about it besides try to push and roam (unless they're just bad, in which case I can farm them easily).  Relying on your lane opponent to be bad isn't an example of the strength of a champion though.\n\nIf she gets ahead, she's basically like a Zed just lurking around and deleting people before making a clean escape.  If she goes even, she isn't a super threat in team fights so just force them and carry on.
