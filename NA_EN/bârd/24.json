Kalista is overpowered for a different reason, she's overpowered by her entire concept I think. The entire design was a flaw to begin with. She has infinite mobility that allows her to outscale every ADC in the game due to her Rend, and on top of that she has two forms of hard CC. I'm not sure many people realize it but I also think Kalista's sentinel passive lets her and her support do 20% of a target's health on auto attack when they attack that same target. Yasuo and Kalista are both quite unbalanced despite the community's myth a guy with like 10 different passives, an ability that invalidates all projectiles in the game, infinite dashes through any enemy/neutral units, and 100% crit chance at 15 minutes into the game is just oh so weak and how dare Riot EVER give him a real skill base.

The designer has proven totally incompetent to actually make good, balanced champions and I would be totally fine if every champion made by him with the exception of Zyra was nerfed. Zyra is a really handicapped mid laner (I just got Level 4 with her so I have fair experience with her mid.) and probably the only champion CertainlyT ever made that is underpowered.

Take Nasus mains for example. It feels great to get that mid-game powerspike and snowball from there, but to the enemy he feels like a bullshit champion that you can barely push out of lane and have to babysit for the entire game. Then you've got Lux mains who enjoy her laning supremacy, picking power and mid-game teamfight dominance, and yet to the enemy it feels like a champion you can barely approach without risk of being blown up from so far away you can't properly react. Then you have the poster-boy for \"balanced\" and \"healthy\" in this game right now: Vel'koz. His mains love his controlling playstyle and early-mid-game team eradication capability, and his detractors hate that a good Vel'koz can make you feel literally helpless against him, especially if you're melee. \n\nPlaying against a champion will rarely ever feel fun in the hands of a competent player, just like if you're doing well with a champion everyone will hate your champion. So play Fizz, or LeBlanc, or Yasuo, or whatever, because, well, they're here and they won't be going anywhere. All we can do now is balance them because discussing whether or not their signature move would be more apropos elsewhere, well, it's only discussion after the fact because the action that permanently determined that move's fate was already made. Reworks can only accomplish so much, and if they're used too much they'll simply be viewed as a balancing crutch - and you should never have to rely on a crutch when you're perfectly capable of walking unaided.\n\nThis is not to say I like or support CertainlyT's champions, because I friggin' hate them.

However, in all of the examples you listed, I can point to real weaknesses and real counterplay that leaves players who get beaten by that champion feeling like they can do something better to win the next time around.  CertainlyT champions are very bad in that regard.  For Lux, you dodge her skillshots.  For Nasus, you force him to teamfight & then kite him.  For Velkoz, you dodge his skillshot & even if you didn't dodge the first, you dodge the subsequent ones to avoid taking damage from his passive.    \n\nFor Kalista?  You're near-forced to take a point-and-click CC, you're prevented from trying to contest a smite without killing the enemy team, you're at a ridiculous disadvantage if your team is immobile, etc.  The game you lose to Kalista as a fed Udyr or fed similar champion, you don't feel like there was anything you could've done short of choosing a different champ.  The game you lose to Yasuo feels just as helpless if you're a champion with power invested in projectiles (perhaps even your ultimate) and Yasuo just negates it with a non-ult spell.  But even that still feels like you had a chance if you timed it differently - the rest of Yasuo's kit is what feels worse.  The stupid mobility, the long range engage, the steroids... there's playing against someone and not enjoying it because you're on the losing end, and then there's playing against someone and not enjoying it regardless of which end you're on.  The latter was why Yorick got nerfed into oblivion, and it's why I despise Yasuo.  Darius is equally unhealthy for a lot of top lane melee matchups.  \n\nThere's a reason people make this claim of CertainlyT champions and not of the rest.  Very few people complained about new Sion being unfun to play against, very few complained about new Ashe, very few complained about Velkoz or Braum.

This is also why I feel she's super-unpleasant to deal with as a melee champion, because what crowd control melees rely on to stick to her just doesn't work well most of the time._\n* **Remove the Black Spear's stun/death animation, and allow its targets to refuse the pact. **_The fact that the Black Spear's pact is unconsensual deeply irritates me, and its death pact thing even more so, as I think it brings little flavor and instead, at best, delays an ally, and at worst stuns them at a really inappropriate time. I guess it might be bad for an ally to refuse the pact and cause Kalista to try again, but even so, if nobody wants to bond to Kalista there are deeper issues at hand than her personal loss in power._\n* **Remove Kalista's global soundbites when making a pact or calling back her Oathsworn ally with Fate's Call.** _Many Rioters on the effects teams constantly mention how global visual or sound effects occupy space and make it more difficult to add more of those, because too many would clutter the game and call unnecessary attention. Neither Kalista's pact nor her ultimate are relevant enough to warrant global sound effects, in my opinion, as neither carry any immediate global threat. I'm also fairly salty that she gets to have global effects when {{champion:30}} can't even do the same when casting his ult, which already carries global visuals and sound._\n* **Remove Sentinel's mana cost, make the sentinels' movement speed scale with Kalista's, and increase the number of laps they can perform per rank, as well as the ability's maximum range.** _Let's be honest, mana is never a real gate to Kalista's W active, nor does that ability need to be gated by anything other than its long recharge time. I feel like Kalista's sentinels are fairly underused overall, too, and deserve to be activated more readily for target-hunting and objective guarding. Utility is also a facet of Kalista I feel is heavily underdeveloped, and buffing her unique vision contribution would allow her to shine in a unique way without stepping too hard on other champions' toes._\n* **Remove Rend's slow and mana restoration and cap its damage versus monsters, but reduce its mana cost to 40 / 35 / 30 / 25 / 20 and add an indicator over targets that will be killed upon activating Rend.** _As an ability that is made specifically to execute targets, Rend absolutely does not need a slow, which I feel is redundant in many ways: she doesn't need more kill potential on an ability that is itself designed to secure kills, and whose success is meant to be a hard yes (target's dead, Rend refreshes) or no (target's alive, Rend goes on cooldown), and she doesn't need more sticking or kiting power when she has on-demand infinite dashes. I dislike its unlimited damage against monsters because it allows her to out-{{summoner:11}} junglers and exert far too much control over objectives, and I dislike the mana restoration because it's mostly a not-too-visible bonus effect designed to let her clear waves more easily, when a simple mana cost reduction per rank would do just as well. I'd rather she had more power placed into stuff like her extended damage, unique utility or Oathsworn interaction than extraneous effects like these._\n* **Reduce Rend's initial damage (to something like 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 40% AD), for example), but have Kalista's Oathsworn ally apply spears with every basic attack, and have each additional spear deal the same damage as the first.** _Kalista's interaction with her Oathsworn often feels downplayed outside of her ult, and I feel it would make sense for her ally to contribute to her damage by participating in extended trades with her. I also think smoothing out her damage would shift her poking power (which isn't too big a thing on her) towards her Q, which also feels a bit redundant in her kit, and would allow her to work even better with attack speed builds overall._\n\nWho's on board with this?","replies":[{"poster":"ijustlikejuice","date":"2015-07-04T00:33:23.485+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've convinced me man.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-07-04T01:18:25.103+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

If she's not in attack range, she has to walk, and she's incredibly slow. The entire point is that she has great mobility as long as she stays in combat. It's kind of reverse Boots of Mobility. Slows are to chase or to escape. If she's using her passive, the combat has already started. Stuns and roots are to lock someone down or disengage. I keep getting this feeling that people want a melee champion with no gap closers and no stuns to be able to chase her down and unload all their damage on her, and...that's just not reasonable.\n\nYes, Rend needs a slow, for the same reason its mana cost refund can be triggered more than once per cast. It's meant to be stacked on multiple targets, and is expected to only kill some of them. Furthermore, if Rend doesn't get the kill immediately, Kalista has no means to re-engage without that slow, AND she loses a large chunk of her damage in the near future. Every other ADC has some form of crowd control, and most also have a target-independent dash that they can use from outside their attack range. Kalista can kite and move about only while still in combat. She has no other means of engaging unless her support is around to answer Fate's Call.\n\nAs for damage against monsters, objective control is a significant part of her identity in terms of mechanics (the other being unrivaled kiting ability), but she still has to work for it. In order for her to really \"out-smite smite\", she needs to have been committed to attacking dragon/baron for a significant stretch of time. If you let her have that much access to objectives without challenging her, you don't deserve to reliably just walk up and steal them with smite (and also you're not doing your job as a jungler). **A summoner spell is not a substitute for playing the game.** There are dashes that arguably outperform Flash on a shorter cooldown, too, and a few champions who can easily out-heal a Heal spell or out-shield a barrier, or cleanse themselves frequently. And she's not the only champion who, given proper setup, is able to deal a large chunk of damage with a single move. Cho'Gath eats dragons for a snack between teamfights, and his \"better than smite\" move needs no setup time at all. So many people keep complaining that she can secure dragon if you let her sit there and attack it for 20 seconds, and I am just baffled as to why anyone would let her do that, and expect her NOT to get the dragon, or think it's unfair that she does. **Kalista does not steal dragon or baron. She has to earn it.**\n\nMaking Rend work like Braum's passive would be horrifyingly oppressive and un-fun to play against, even if you didn't boost the damage per additional spear. Please, no. It would be so much extra damage. D: Don't let her build Rend stacks without actually attacking. Please, please no.\n\nOverall, I'm just not feeling this. Trim her attack range, maybe. Reduce the scaling on Rend, and make crits grant extra stacks. Take some of the damage out of Pierce, and give it back plus a little more only against targets with Rend stacks (since you're supposed to kill them with Pierce to transfer the stacks, but how often does that happen?). Pull some levers here and there, but don't strip out the things that make playing her what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-07-04T04:20:04.965+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoMNia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5zmjygbq,comment-id=00140001,timestamp=2015-07-04T03:22:28.701+0000)\n>\n> I keep getting this feeling that people want a melee champion with no gap closers and no stuns to be able to chase her down and unload all their damage on her, and...that's just not reasonable.\n\nBecause clearly, it would be ludicrous for a champion like {{champion:2}} or {{champion:68}} to so much as try to fight her.

I also feel making her completely independent of her Oathsworn ally, when she has this whole set of mechanics that put power into interaction with them, sort of defeats the point, and makes her weaknesses less meaningful.

Kalista completely invalidates that with Rend, and effectively guarantees that her team will secure an objective if allowed to sit on it for long enough, which completely goes against the idea of clutch steals. Junglers have to earn their objectives too, and even other effects like Cho's ult or {{champion:20}}'s Consume don't invalidate smite steals in the same way.

Kalista, by contrast, offers no real opportunities for many champions to fight back against her, and consequently combat against her feels extremely lopsided.

If Kalista were somehow able to steal objectives extremely well, that would be somewhat fine, if extraneous to her theme, but the fact that she makes Smite steals near-impossible dampens play.

This exchange has been bizarre. \"That only works if you build Hurricane.\" So build Hurricane. \"Hurricane doesn't do much for her.\" Except what we literally just talked about. Come on. Kalista wants to stack Rend on multiple targets. Being able to do that without juggling primary targets for her attack is a MASSIVE boost to her overall damage potential. Almost every Kalista builds Hurricane, with good reason.\n\nAnd yes, if you fail to maintain vision control and map pressure, such that your opponents can make a run at a major objective without you immediately knowing, you have let them take it and deserve that disadvantage. As for Kalista specifically, her objective control increases the longer she is allowed to pursue said objective unmolested. Steals might seem more exciting, but they are not inherently healthier for the game than proactive vision and map control, the latter of which tends to preclude the former ANYWAY. Making a run at an objective when you don't have vision is actually likely to result in a wipe when your enemies show up at full health and you're weakened from fighting dragon/baron, while having vision allows you to disrupt such an attempt and often get a couple of kills, too.\n\nI absolutely think that a summoner spell and a single item should NOT be more important than your choice of champion. They are supplemental. Bringing Heal and building Mikael's doesn't make you a healer. Bringing Flash and building Ghostblade doesn't make you the most mobile champion in the game. Bringing Barrier and building Locket doesn't make you Nautilus. And bringing Smite and building a jungle item doesn't make you the end-all, be-all of objective control. Is the jungler the big-shot in the jungle in the laning phase, as the name would imply? Yes. But when people start roaming and grouping? It's a team game, and everybody has their contributions to make.\n\nOne more thing. Gambit Gaming vs. Elements, around mid February. Diamond as Nidalee has dragon warded. Elements makes a run at it. He launches a ~700 damage javelin before jumping into the pit from blue side and smiting, and Edward Thresh lanterns him out. THAT is a proper steal. He was able to do it because he picked a champion that boasts significant objective control power as one of her strengths, he had vision, and he coordinated with his team. Smite is important, and has its role to play, but champion picks and strong play matter more than summoner spells. And they should. Also of note in that game: Gambit's Kalista couldn't even reach dragon. I'm telling you, the way to beat Kalista's objective securing power is to control her access to those objectives in the first place. She is NOTHING to dragon or baron if she shows up late at your attempt, OR if you show up early at hers. And here's the thing: if Rend is stacked high enough to kill the dragon, ANY other ADC would have killed dragon before you even showed up.\n\nOverall, the changes you're suggesting rely on each other for any justification. Each one of them makes no sense in the context of Kalista's current identity. You keep saying how she \"doesn't need\" what she has, but she does, because of other things that she has, or doesn't have. There is a synergy between elements of her kit, and with certain items that she builds. There is a reason for all of it. You are asking that all of that be thrown away and replaced, because...you feel entitled, as a low-mobility melee champion, to be able to fight one of the highest mobility ranged champions? Because you feel entitled, as a jungler, to have a chance to steal objectives from her when you failed to zone away or disrupt her attempts at those objectives at any time until the very last moment, just because you're the designated jungler?

Smite stealing is a risky maneuver, made even riskier by good objective control from the enemy team, but it's usually never impossible, because Smite is a powerful enough spell to capture an objective by itself. Rend allows Kalista to overrule Smite's power and thereby make Smite stealing practically impossible: making a certain strategy more difficult is usually fine, but shutting a healthy and fun strategy down isn't, particularly when the reason behind it (champion X gets to deal more damage than a jungle-centric summoner spell at the press of a button) is not particularly exciting in itself.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SoMNia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5zmjygbq,comment-id=001400010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-05T02:35:35.064+0000)\n> \n> I absolutely think that a summoner spell and a single item should NOT be more important than your choice of champion. \n\nI believe choosing a champion should not be the be-all and end-all to game strategy, and item builds and summoner spell picks are crucial in establishing the contribution they can make. You cite lane-agnostic spells like {{summoner:4}} and {{summoner:7}} , but I feel Smite is different in that it is intrinsically connected to the jungle: it's a requirement to unlock items aimed specifically at junglers, and is only picked outside the jungle when those items become too generally powerful. By picking Smite, you are effectively choosing to be your team's jungler, with all the power and responsibility that entails.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SoMNia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5zmjygbq,comment-id=001400010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-05T02:35:35.064+0000)\n> \n> One more thing.

Kalista already has massive privilege over every other champion by having unlimited free mobility, yet you also want her to have even more power against melee enemies trying to catch up to her, have better jungle objective control than an entire role for whom that is their prime contribution, and have tons of personal power when the crux of her gameplay relies on her interaction with a specific ally. The changes I am proposing emphasize Kalista's reliance on her Oathsworn, as well as her ally synergy and unique utility: these are what constitute her identity, not her abusive edge cases, and the fact that you'd rather ditch the former in favor of the latter does not suggest you have Kalista's best gameplay interests in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-07-05T11:05:50.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, {{item:3085}} doesn't do that for every ranged champion.

If you let them get to and objective uncontested until the very last moment, you SHOULD lose it, unless you're bringing massive burst damage, yourself. If you don't have that burst...get there earlier. I have sympathy for those who fail to do so, but they still lose the objective. It's how the game is played. Don't ever give your opponents unchallenged access to objectives, or if you do, accept that you've lost them, unless you have specifically arranged to deal with that (say, by having a javelin that adds massive damage on top of your smite). Being able to unconditionally show up at the last second and press a single button to invalidate the advantage you gave them might make for a flashy and entertaining play, but it is NOT healthy for the game.

If you do let her, don't complain when it works as intended.\n\nYou want to not only make her more susceptible to CC, but remove the most reliable CC from her kit, thereby eliminating any possibility of her actually escaping anyone without sacrificing the life of her support, OR chasing anyone who's managed to escape her attack range for a moment.

And no, the abilities she has that you've arbitrarily labeled \"abuse cases\" due to your own distaste are not automatically unhealthy because you don't like them. Kalista was designed to work the way she does, though not necessarily to the exact extent. For example, Riot even talked about her objective control as a prominent characteristic of Rend when she was unveiled (and so did a lot of other people, so don't think they don't know about this).

If you wanted this exchange to be respectful, you would have shown ANY respect after my first straightforward response. YOU have set the tone. I simply acquiesced. Yes, NOW, I'm being snide and scornful, because I'm getting tired of this. But you're right to say that insulting each other is not going to be productive. Mayhap we should stick to the issues and dispense with ad hominem nonsense. I really don't enjoy being hostile, especially over something that doesn't justify it. It's stressful, and probably bad for my health.\n\nMy \"line of argumentation\", by the way, is actually entirely consistent. As for bias...you know, I WANT to like playing her, but the fact is that I'm really bad at it, so when I'm forced to ADC (I'm a support main, and sometimes I jungle), I play Ashe instead. I just don't have a problem with people playing to her strengths, nor with her winning against champs that are markedly weak against her best traits. I've also noted that her winrate is anything but out of control, and there is a lot of outplay potential in most of her kit at each stage of the game. She is pretty close to being balanced, which is why I'm weirded out by people wanting to gut her. People freaked out about Ekko, too, and frankly, he's fun, but not actually that strong.\n\n**\"you also want her to have even more power against melee enemies trying to catch up to her, have better jungle objective control than an entire role for whom that is their prime contribution, and have tons of personal power when the crux of her gameplay relies on her interaction with a specific ally.\"**\n\nNope. Nope nope nope. I have not advocated adding ANY power to her at all. She needs nerfs/slight rebalancing. But in a general sense, I have no problem with her having the potential, when fed/fully built, to outclass extremely low-range, low-mobility champions if she's not locked down, because kiting is kind of her thing, and anyone particularly vulnerable to being kited SHOULD lose to her. I have no problem with her being able to out-class a summoner spell (by itself, not counting the abilities of the champion who may be wielding it) in a specific case that requires her to spend such a long time setting it up that literally anyone else in any other circumstance would have considered even attempting such a play to be eminently punishable many times over. I have no problem with her having personal power, given it's already the case that the only engagement tool in HER kit requires SOMEONE ELSE to activate it, and a large chunk of her damage requires that same ally to be present (but mercifully does not scale with that ally's attack speed on top of her own, and is gated by an on-target cooldown, because it's actually incredibly dangerous).","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-07-05T18:09:20.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoMNia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5zmjygbq,comment-id=00140001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-05T11:05:50.883+0000)\n>\n> No, {{item:3085}} doesn't do that for every ranged champion.

It's not expressly unhealthy, but I'd rather the focus of any champion's rewards be on deliberate plays, rather than accidents. If the only reason to buy Runaan's is so that you can accidentally activate Kalista's really powerful poke passive/E reset, then I don't think that's a strong reason at all.

It's a maneuver that requires huge amounts of skill in timing and control, is dependent on many more factors than just a button press (vision control and map awareness, for example), and creates huge amounts of positive tension on both sides.
