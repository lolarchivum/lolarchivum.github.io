Her old W felt awful unless people knew what it did, and even then it wasn't that strong. Interesting sure, but the skill itself did not feel that impactful even when I got the rare person who knew what it did.\n\nI did like shield explosion, but I feel like they moves that all onto her Q, which is why the values when powered up are as high as they are now. \n\nI can see why people liked her old passive I guess, I main Lucario in smash so I get the whole getting more powerful with Aura/taking damage etc stuff. I don't have a problem with it when it is done well, Lucario imo in smash 4 is overtuned with it not really toxic in itself. I treat it like damage in Ultra's in Street Fighter 4. The issue is bigger in a league setting when it affects her so much in terms of balance. She gained free AP for losing AP, this is more of a problem here when it didn't define her when it was just a stat buff. I guess there is the whole timing thing, aka Soraka Wish style, but it made her a nightmare to balance if you also consider her mantras at level 1 and her 6 skill abilities. \n\nNew Karma is a lot easier to fine tune and her passive actually affects her kit in a meaningful skillful way for taking more risks or being more active. \n\nI only like her in Middle lane these days, she can work bot but she is in the same sense for me as Annie where I could play them bot lane but I'm not a fan of it over other picks. \n\nI liked it when they reworked her, I get the binary part. I do only half agree with the mostly R>Q part. Yes for Poke and raw damage you want that. I have done R>W when I needed to support my team more or needed the health. I have done R>E in a team fight when I needed to give a lot of people distance and safety from AoE damage like a Kennen Ult. That was more useful than R>Q. I agree R>Q is the better choice in most situations, I strongly disagree that it's almost always what you should do on her. \n\nI like her a lot more as she is now, as a Karma main my main issue was removing her fans. I hate that a lot and still want them back on her model outside of the dance.\n\nBut overall I do enjoy her far more than old karma and I agree her old kit was a huge balance issue in a lot of areas.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-10-28T00:14:53.552+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should emphasize, my complaint *is not* balance.

I personally really liked the old Karma, in particular her gaining AP when losing HP mechanic that doesn't exist anymore.

A heal that could do damage, a shield that also did damage, gaining more potential when low on life; these things helped sell the kind of character she was billed as.\n\nUnfortunately, they took her old tether (stronger effect rather than a change in nature) and applied it to all the reworked skills, so now nothing left of her old self remained.\n\nShe might be \"more powerful\", but she's also far less interesting and pretty much resembles every other skill-shot nuke + shield champion in the roster.","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-10-27T13:05:05.204+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"And she's STILL never played.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-10-27T14:11:51.633+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her play rate sky-rocketed the first 2 months after the rework.\nThat was enough for Riot to call it a success.\n\n. . .

Karma was the victim of many factors, and with Riot the way they are now, they're never going to go back and re-evaluate exactly how they messed her up. Stripped of her identity, stripped of her niche, and changed into a generic mage that has nothing valuable to justify picking her over someone else. Every reason they used to change her was a result of Riot themselves setting up the excuse. They kept her out of rotation just to say that no one played her or knew what she did, and is it any surprise that when you keep something hidden from player view that they don't know anything about it?\n\nIt's my belief that the original Karma was shipped in a state that only barely passed majority vote. Once those who disliked her were able to, they reworked her into what she is now by utilizing self-fulfilling prophecy tactics. Does it sound conspiratorial in this light? Sure, it does, but what other reason is there when those who worked on her admitted to never liking the old version, or never playing her, or outright ignoring and running changes counter to the feedback? So many who hated her had their hands on her rework, and if so many disliked her in the state she was released then why would she have been released?\n\nAnyway, that's just my additional two cents on the matter.

It's also interesting that the more involved and precise she in in combat, the more choices she will have thanks to her passive.\n\nAnd so, as a result of having the two-charge system, her spells couldn't actually be powerful even when mantra'd because she'd always be able to immediately follow up with a second cast of another spell.\n\nNew Karma has meaningful decisions in that she must choose which powerful spell upgrade she wants. Landing her full ult Q can actually kill a full health carry in one shot. Her W can heal her and root someone for an incredible duration. And her AoE shield is just impressive and powerful, one of the best disengage or even engage tools in the game, even just due to its flexibility.\n\nOld Karma had one of the lowest winrates in the game, and was rarely played in the position she was created for, so when Riot remade her they decided to go with what the players wanted and made her more of a mage than a support.\n\nMuch as I liked old Karma myself, I do prefer new Karma _because_ of her meaningful choices. As well, she is just as flexible position-wise as she was pre-rework, which is something I appreciate.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-10-27T14:11:06.204+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"As some one who played alot old karma, i heavily disagree.\nEven with two charges, you often had to decide which, or more which not to manta, as you would usually use ~6 or more spells in a fight.\n\nAlso, new karma has a pretty easy choice, as it's rather easy to determain what spell to mandra in a given situation.\n\nAld karma had alot more decision by the fact that their skills harmed oppnents while helping allys.\nDo i shield my carry or do i use the shieldbomb on my frontline to nule their backline?\nDo i heal most of my team with Q but only hit 1 opponent, or do i land a nice aoe nuke but only heal one guy?\n\nHer low range, her W and her lowish base hp made her positioning incredible curcial.\n\nHer low winrate was because she had a lot meaningfull decisions, and because she was the first champ that really interacted with teammate.\nHer kit was ahead of her time.\nThe only problems her old kit had was that she offered little counterplay if played well, and she was slightly undertuned with her 6 rank skills that ended up as strong as most 5 rank skills at that time., but those problems could have beein solved while preciving most of her kit, especially the duallity which is now totally gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-10-27T16:00:18.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's not be crazy about this...Old Karma had FAR more decisions than new Karma.\n\nNew Karma:\nPlay defensively, shield your team\nPlay Offensively, damage the enemy\nAnd if you need CC, mantra your root, which is also used as a bait.\n\nI'm not saying New Karma isn't good, but I liked Old Karma significantly better.\n\nOld Karma:\nPlay **Defensively **--> Aoe Heal Allies with % health heal (GREAT on Tanks and low life allies) OR Shield and Ally (And no use mantra for high ratio shield) OR Speed up all allies in tether while slowing all enemies in tether (Portentially need Mantra).\nPlay **Offensively **-> Use AoE Fans (No Mantra) to hit enemies, Use tether to  Damage enemies (no Mantra), Aoe Bomb from a safe distance (Mantra).\n\nWhat ability slows enemies, speeds up allies and damages enemies?
