When the Support is doing shit and the ADC is doing alright but you decide to lump the ADC in when you type \"/all report this bot int feed\". ;)\n2. When the Support is going base every 2 minutes leaving the ADC 1v2 for 80% of the laning phase, and then the Support points out the ADC is behind in farm and sucks. And somehow the team agrees.\n3. When the Support goes out to ward at the wrong time, gets caught, then blame the ADC/Team for no followup.\n4. When the Support wants to make plays and fight inside a minion wave, then blames the ADC for backing away instead of suiciding with him.\n5. When the Support Exhaust's the enemy Support after they used all their abilities instead of exhausting the enemy ADC/Jungler.\n6. When Thresh players place the lantern on top of 2-3 enemy team players and expect you to be able to instantly click it.\n7. When it's an easy tower dive to execute but the full health Support is taking forever to make up his mind to hit the 20% health enemy player, regardless of the spammed pings telling him to go in. Meanwhile you just sit there thinking \"hit him already or do I have to tank tower?\".\n8. When Soraka players ult to get an assist off another lane even though the healing wasn't necessary. Forcing her to have one less tool incase it's needed soon after.\n9. When Thresh players miss cannon minions ALL the time, then spam ping you when you don't let them attempt taking it anymore.\n10. When I make my Support aware I'd rather farm up and engage in small trades/poke until I'm stronger yet he keeps going ham all the time. \n11. The Supports that play behind the ADC ALL the time and apply 0 pressure, allowing the enemy botlane to step forward and pressure their zone control (note: not necessarily in a bad matchup). They then blame the lane on you. Like.. damn you're not a Soraka or a Janna.\n12. Leona players that always seem to want to go deeeeeeeeeeeep and forget that an ADC might need some peel.\n13. Top and Mid losing horribly allowing the enemy team to easily camp and 4-5 man Botlane (which happens anyway to be fair).\n14. Midlaners that either don't SS, follow the roam, or pressure Tower.. DO AT LEAST ONE OF THEM.\n15. Same with toplaners that either don't follow the TP or pressure the Tower in the eventuality that they didn't use their own TP.\n16. Junglers who invade botside jungle when botlane is pushed under tower with 15 creeps. He gets collapsed on and dies, then blames the ADC and Support for not helping. I'm not losing 15 creeps and experience because they decide to invade at the wrong time.\n17. When the enemy team all rallies around their ADC, engaging, peeling, frontlining, absorbing skill shots, zoning. Meanwhile your team just chases low health targets, ignore the Hecarims and Irelia's diving on their ADC. Then say \"We don't have an ADC, look at the enemy team's one, he's actually dealing damage\".\n18. Supports that complain when you miss a condemn on Vayne after you've literally sat there watching them miss 10 hooks and 5 flays on Thresh.\n19. The fact that alot of the time if botlane is lost, and the ADC is behind in CS, it's always the ADC's fault. Nevermind there being actual reasons for him to be behind, when in alot of cases, botlane is won by the Support, not the ADC (obviously depends on matchups).\n20. Getting starved from farming by your own team, then blamed for the lack of CS.\n21. Teams not realising that ADCs need items to scale better and would like to farm up for a while, but they force you to run around the map like a headless chicken.\n22. Supports that don't know when to push the wave in, help me push it in, or leave it as it is. They somehow aren't capable of knowing when to do those things, even after you ping/type to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2017-02-07T22:25:48.012+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"People forget that botlane has two parts, if either one is doing dumb shit it makes the lane impossible for the other.
