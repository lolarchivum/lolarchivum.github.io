A young jinx witnessing this broke. Now why would he do this. He was a cutthroat according to singed. He had relations to Gangs in zaun. So there was this lil girl that WW saw and one that resembles jinx and loved tinkering. What if her parents had a hextech weaponry/tools shop. This would also explain her hextech gear.
