Don't get me wrong, I like the history behind these skins. But putting this into perspective, if Gentleman Cho'gath was released today, it would probably be sold either as a 975 or a 1350 skin. \r\n\r\nI can honestly see on a marketing perspective as of why you wouldn't update these skins. But I feel as if the incoming new players would feel more attracted to these skins if given a bit more attention.\r\n\r\nGentlman Cho'gath is absolutely my favorite skin in league though. And I would find it amazing if he had a recall animation where he would sit down on a crimson early 1900's couch, taking a sip on his favorite Noxian Blend of tea while listening to the finest classical music.\r\n\r\nHere are my questions to** Riot:**\r\n\r\n**Have you thought about or considered going back and working on the original legendary skins?**\r\n\r\n**What impact does changing  the old skins have on new players vs more experience players?**\r\n\r\n**What does changing aspects of old skins mean to new sales rather than newer ones?**\r\n\r\n**Would changing aspects of skins affect the perception of players in a negative way?**\r\n\r\n**What do these older skins mean to you as person who works at Riot games?**\r\n\r\n**If newer players asked you 'Why would I buy these skins?' what would you answer?**\r\n\r\nIf you do take time to read and answer these questions,\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"AWeeLittleFox","date":"2015-03-17T22:50:14.324+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"Blood Lord Vladimir is so underwhelming compared to Soul Stealer. \nThey should either update old legendaries or drop their prices and refund the difference to the people who bought them.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikana","date":"2015-03-18T00:29:02.069+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":">Blood Lord Vladimir\n\nAt least you have a custom voice over.

Otherwise, Riot can just admit they aren't legendary quality anymore and refund us the difference for what they REALLY are:  975 and 1350 skins.\n\nThe point is that ALL the other skins got updates to keep them in line with current standards, but the most expensive two classes of skins are somehow exempt from this.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-03-19T03:11:55.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Were they Legendary on release?
