I&#039;m sure many would like to do fill, if not for that one role that they dislike strongly.\n\n\n_**UPDATE:**_: Many people have made mention that Riot has tried this on other servers and it has gotten negative reviews. This was dated back over a year ago. Currently, I believe support has been seeing a lot more play and has been given plenty of attention since to make it a much more attractive role. I would like to see a test run implemented for a brief amount of time on the NA server to see how it affects our server. If it goes negatively, then yeah, get rid of it, however I think it is worth a try again. Also, how long did the test run on the OCE server?\n\nI see this as an option for people who don't want to support, but also want more variety to the roles they get. (Personally, I'm a support main this season. I use to hate the role, but it has grown on me and is now one of my favorite positions to take)\n\nIn addition to what many have mentioned: Although this sounds very contradicting, maybe the support role could be an option you can't object.

Everyone has a role they dislike, i know people who hate TOP lane more than any other lane, people who just cant play JG if their life depended on it and never WANT to they should not have to and it goes on for the rest of the lanes in separate cases or scenario. if the people do not want to play support... why should they have to the game is for entertainment purposes and they should enjoy it for its full extent not be stuck in a game for 20-60 minutes doing something they absolutely hate. With that said perhaps that would be a call to riot to stop enforcing a SUPPORT meta .... i remember back in season 1 and 0 that was literally just a strategic option. not a way you where forced to play i miss exploring different ways of winning the game not being stuck to a format of play requiring you to play a part you dont enjoy.\n\nGiven the fact that some people despise playing a certain role at any given time how are they expected to bring the best performance possible, this tends to drag down tons of other players they are already bringing a minuscule amount of motivation just because the are forced to do so. Why would anyone want to bring their worst performing role or lane to a team at any given time.\n\nThis is a fantastic idea and i think it should really be looked at.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-10-26T19:22:09.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot always supported your choice unless your choice is actually hurting everyone on a server wide level.

If you wait for longer periods of time and the role is still vacant, the matchmaker will broaden the search parameters and your team is going to be stuck with teammates that're from lower ELOs and still don't know how to play with you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OrangeHood","date":"2017-10-26T07:29:06.670+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a pretty negative review for no reason honestly (*fist to the sky, fight the man level rant here*).

Support has been shown a lot more love this season in ways they make the role more entertaining and although it still remains the least desired role, the number of players in the role has definitely increased.

It's saying, \"We should give it a test on the NA server and see how it does with the player base.\"\n\nThis could be a great change, it could be a flop, or it could make no difference.
