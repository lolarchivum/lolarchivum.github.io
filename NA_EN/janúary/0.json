Those are very weak for ADC Lux because she's not building any AP. Just because it's physically possible for any champion to buy IE BT PD ER doesn't mean they can serve the purpose of an ADC, which is dealing lots of sustained damage with autoattacks, not damaging towers at range. Any champ with a ranged auto can do that, and more than just ADCs are good at taking down towers.

If their job is to be safe, then they autofail that, because most of them have such trouble laning that they need a support to accompany them (there's also ADC junglers like Yi, who have specific tools for that).\n\nI do know what facts are. I have provided some. You have provided none. All you have is a guess based on several gross misconceptions, not the least of which is that I've ever personally tried ADC Lux. I haven't. I see other people try it from time to time, and it's always trash. It's not a fun off-meta build that can pull off some unexpected plays but falls short of optimal performance and thus isn't suitable for ranked play. It's just awful. It doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-10-20T03:14:24.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dLkGMhgA,comment-id=00050000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-19T23:20:57.456+0000)\n>\n> An ADC's job is to deal consistent damage not just to objectives but also to enemy champions.

Ideally yes, youll want to be dealing consistent damage, but if teamfight damage is what youre after, then ADCs are far from the best options for that. ADCs primary role is simply damage objectives safely. This is even more important than teamfight damage, as it means you can close the game out with more on the map.\n\nSo basically, tl;dr: You cant play lux, AD or AP.
