Even before the mana changes, Morello was the rush item, but it wasn't because of the VERY conditional Grievous Wounds. It was because it had mana regen, 20% CDR, and a big chunk of AP (80 before the changes IIRC). That didn't change after the mana changes either. Now Morello's gave you 20% CDR, 100 AP and mana, which was fine since they basically removed mana regen.\n\nEven now, Morello's isn't the main item because of GW, it's because it has Mpen.\n\nClearly Riot doesn't understand the problem with mage itemization. Yes, mages want the same 3 stats. So do assassins. So do ADCs. Every class scales off a few stats. They seem to have no trouble thinking up items with passives and actives that appeal to different styles of ADC, or different assassins. But when it comes to mages they just don't have any creativity.","replies":[{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2018-06-01T00:05:50.219+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not disagreeing, but I do want to point out that I frequently build Morellos specifically for the grevious wounds.\n\nThere are Soraka's everywhere right now.

In the boards community it's starting to be like one of those situations where someone cleans their desk like a normal person and then says \"oh em gee I'm such an oh see dee!\"\n\nThey set down the foundation through haste passive and adding multiple mana items that could compete once the stats are balanced. That's a pretty big success\n\nI think the problem stems from: \n\n- Seraph's requires constant casting which isn't viable on a lot of champs, and there's this weird counterintuitive strategy where you cast in base\n\n- If you buy Seraph's you'll almost always want RoA (except for when Seraph's was OP), you almost never want RoA without Seraph's. The two just synergize so well.\n\n- Seraph's is the only defensive option out of the three lost chapter items and gives the most AP and mana. It's hidden behind a time barrier out of necessity but at the same time champions who just want early-mid game defensive itemization without all this *extra* AP and mana (as it'd up the cost, or have a barrier). However it's important to note defensive itemization can mess up laning phase if it's overly efficient!\n\n- GLP and Luden's usually overtake and invalidate each other because... People only think about damage? I don't know. They're two completely different items in my eyes. I think it's because how the items are used in this meta, etc. since in this meta I think mages are measured by how quickly they can oneshot squishies and how often (ahem since tanks buy 1 MR item and ignore magic damage, and mages have double pen and kits balanced around bursting even if they're artillery or battlemages but that's for another time). Otherwise no clue.\n\n- Some playstyles might not feel included because all the different mages can't really be fit into three items\n\n\nSo the goals Riot needs to work towards is: make Seraph's and RoA good independent items (or RoA at least), create lost chapter items for all playstyles including defensive options, change GLP or Luden's to differentiate\n\n\n------------\n\nI can see a Tiamat/jg item like system where you buy one lost chapter and get several build paths for it (only can pick one though). But I'm not sure. Would love to see a mana item build out of aegis of the legion (and it won't be OP in laning phase since most mid lane champions are only of a single damage type. It'd be inefficient)\n\nFor RoA/Seraph's, make tear based on time like RoA instead of per cast. Buff RoA's stats, but make RoA and Seraph's/tear's mana (either the base, or the mana gained, or both) a unique passive that doesn't stack except for the purpose of Seraph's Awe. This is probably the best solution imo since RoA is a pretty cool item but if I don't build Seraph's I lack mana, so I build just Seraph's instead (and many people build both)\n\n------------\n\nThe problem with AP having more actives and passive than it already does, as people keep suggesting, is that while you get build diversity, you get less viable playstyles (think redemption locket supports) and you're just recreating the problem with runes... At an active/passive (completely disregarding stats, efficiency, and other factors) level, I'd rather be a mage than ADC (wow my cookie clicker can either be a lightning bolt, or make me faster!! *taps mouse like a neurotic old person*) or support (123456 oh what are these weird items in my QWER slots???).\n\n----------","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zullar","date":"2018-06-01T06:54:53.494+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed AP item's need another rework.

Now look at anivia, how is she any different then lux stat wise other then health?\n\nHow is having different needs for hp mana and cdr not a difference for you? By that reason a Zed would build the same as every ADC, I mean they both want AD, the fact that the ADC needs the attack speed and zed does not is completely irrilevant am I right?\n\n\n> Now look at anivia, how is she any different then lux stat wise other then health? I am literally unable to find any real difference between the subclasses\n\nI play both Lux and Anivia and no, they don't need the same stats. Anivia needs WAY MORE MANA (like, a fuckton mana) more then Lux does, she needs more hp and resistances and she doesn't care that much about one-shot levels of damage while Lux relies entirely on them (infact Anivia is completely fine with tanks on enemy team while Lux gets fucked hard against those comps). Nevermind the fact that Lux can also benefit from an entirely different build involving some heal and shield power.\n\n> Artiliery mages have the same and need the same stats as burst mages.\n\nAgain, not true. Artillery are way more reliant on cdr and they rely on spamming their poke while burst mages rely on one-shotting a specific target. While of course they will enjoy if their burst ability is up more having their abilities more often does not impact their play-pattern while an artillery without cdr is basically unable to perform their game pattern fantasy. \nIF they would exist artillery would benefit from an item enhancing them only when they are out of a certain range while burst mages would not because given the nature of their kits they often have tools to turn the battle even with a close enemy (try jumping on a Xerath and then on a Syndra and tell me which one can still kill you if he plays it better then you).\n\n> Almost all battle mages utilize the same stats as burst mages other then the fact that they need more health. The difference is that they build ROA for more health isnt really a difference.\n\nAgain, they don't build more different items simply because THEY DO NOT EXISTS.\n\n\n> They still need mana, cdr, ap, and pen.  \nADCs all need Ad, armor pen and attack speed. Guess they should all build the same item every game, why they have so much of them?\n\n> saying it isnt true doesnt make it untrue.\nSaying it is true doesn't make it true :p\n\n\n> it gives all the stats you need. I am not seeing any real need for those passives and actives you talk about. Again why are u comparing ad to ap?\n\nWe aren't talking about stats! Zeal items for comparison have really good stats for ADCs even without all their passives, and ADCs could function well even without them, some would even say they would be actually rescricted by what their kit was designed to be good at… a Vayne should suck at waveclear for example yet once she gets a  shiv she can clear just fine, she's still going to be worse then something like Sivir for example but not AS MUCH worse as she was designed to be. If the same Vayne would for some reason build a Runaan she would turn from a single target heavy restricted ADC to having AoE damage (not saying she should, I think it's a terrible item on her imho :p, but SHE HAS THE OPTION).","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-06-04T02:29:15.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the point again seems to fly over your head I will address your second point then address the first because they are tied together. One Anivia and lux looking here do not have a difference in stats other then health \n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Lux/Middle\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Anivia/Middle\n\nIf you look anivia gets more health and thats it, they literally build the same items except two, which are the ones that make anivia more healthy. But if you look the items {{item:3003}} and {{item:3285}}  are suppose to give the same effect they are for mana sustain in lane starting early then build into their respected items later. Its obvious that lux doesnt scale as much as lux which is why she takes less scaling items compared to anivia. But if you look the scaling stats are only different in terms of health. Anivia needing more mana isnt a real difference because they are still the same stat. They dont build the same items because they dont have enough items, it is because they need the same stats its as simple as that. Also your Zed example isnt irrelevant for the subject we are talking about. What im trying to get at with this is two points, one comparing ap to ad is pointless, because in terms of diversity in stats between subclasses ad is far more diverse then ap, that in turn means more items for each subclass to be able to do what they do. Point two why should ap get more items with the same stats that do the same thing, it doesnt matter regardless they will be the same thing with either more or less stats. Ad needs the items because like ad assassin back then didnt even have items for themselves, in fact I could understand the outrage for ap assassins but of course mages wouldnt want there counter having more items right? \n\n\nMore mana doesnt change the fact that anivia and lux both need mana. That is like saying navy blue is a darker blue so it isnt blue. They both are the same color, and anivia and lux both need the same stat. We differentiate them as burst and battle by the fact that anivia needs more resistence and stats to survive longer in battle, while burst needs more ap to burst. However that doesnt change the fact that they still need the same stats cdr, ap, and mana. Also if we are talking about a difference in items for each mages class they actually have a abundance. Battle mages need more health then most other mages yes well look, {{item:3027}}  {{item:3151}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3152}} , You have abundant, amount of items that battle mages can use all with different passives and actives. Burst mages have their own items too. In fact the recent mana item changes give a specific item for scaling mages and another for burst mages. So again what more items do you actually need that you do not already have?\n\nWhy are you so bent on this? The fact that a subclass needs more of a stat doesnt change the fact that they build the same stats. Yes they need cdr and ap, but dont burst mages need the exact same thing? Just because they have artillery or burst does change the fact that they are mages. And guess what all mages need is, mana, cdr, and ap nothing changes that fact. They both will kill you if they play better, because they both have great burst? You use xer, what about vel, you wouldnt it also be equally as bad?\n\nAnd the question is why do you need them? You cant sit here and say that each mage doesnt have items for themselves. Saying we want items just because isnt a valid reason, its just like a child whining for a new toy when they already have them.\n\n\nBad comparison, for one vayne has absolutely no wave clear, run again is for on-hit champions. However is there really a valid reason to give artillery mages? BC is to give juggers a fighting chance, can you give me a valid reason for which each mage needs a new item for an area they are struggling in. Because I cant see a reason to give any mage a new item?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2018-06-01T06:20:01.339+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can do a whole thing on AP itemization.
