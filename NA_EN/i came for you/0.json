I can kind of see what you're saying.

I also can't say anything objectively since this topic is largely subjective. \n\nSo what I'm about to say is pretty biased. When I think undercut, I think of Miley Cyrus or  {{champion:119}}, people who try to be (a lack of a better word) 'edgy'.  When I think of nobility, I think of those old fancy European parties where the women wore a lot of powder and had big dresses. I don't think Fiora would get that 'edgy' haircut as it would risk hurting her noble family public image. She seems too elegant and self-restrained to do that as well. Fact is, the haircut breaks away from the 'normal' or traditional haircuts today, so its return was intended to make a statement or to 'stand-out'. Of course, maybe Fiora decided it was time for change.\n\nAdmittedly though, after looking at some of the images of undercuts from that Bioluminescence linked, it does look really cute on some women...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2016-06-28T13:13:43.080+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Doesn't mean they are going to change it just because u said u dont like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-06-28T18:46:45.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if a LARGE amount of the community hated it like they did with her VU hair style, they'd change it.
