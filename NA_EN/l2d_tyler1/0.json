Even in their finals against SSG last year, they had 2 dominant victories (and the wins from SSG weren't as clean as those of MSF).

You really can't see why this is a highly interesting thing? Something that MSF should be proud of?\n\nAltho to be fair it's was to be expected that by the next game after losing one that SKT had adapted and had a response to many of the important part of MSF's strategies while MSF weren't ready for that at all. And after they were slowly forced into playing at SKT's pace however MSF still nearly won the last game.\n\nIt was only a tiny little step away for MSF to won their way into semi's, over SKT, it was incredibly close. \n\n\nThat is still an amazing feat on MSF's part, in essence what they did was to cheese  wins against SKT which is incredible, they didn't follow many of the common strategies and instead just did what they liked and they actually won games like that against the best team in all of league.\n\n\nIf you cant see why this is such a thing in this game where everyone constantly goes on about meta then you need to try and expand your horizons but i shall spell it out for you.\n\n\nWhat MSF did was something that no one had considered possible, they nearly completely ignored the meta to roll over SKT and forced the 3 years in a row champion team into a corner just like that.\n\nI don't think any other team could have done the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Moniker","date":"2017-10-20T16:54:36.179+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"He’s just a troll, ignore him","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kullehh","date":"2017-10-20T20:05:42.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lul hardstuck low silver with 900 matches , if you cant win this retarded game then you must be very smart","replies":[{"poster":"LitAF","date":"2017-10-20T20:27:45.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you think he's so salty?

It were 4 games where Misfits were really dominant. Yes, SKT came out as the better team due to their lategame comebacks, but honestly, the gap is really close and it was REALLY close from being a 3-1 OR 3-2 in favour of MSF. The only game where SKT shined was where Galio was for some reason not banned. That 80% winrate Galio was the only reason SKT could stomp that first game. Every pick from MSF got countered by a convenient R button.\n\nGame 4, if that towerdive at the mid inhib went right or didn't happen, MSF would probably win.\nGame 5, if they were slightly less hesistant on a Baron call or got a better pick after they baited them in or if they won the 50/50 elder drake smite they would've probably won.\n\nBut the same goes for EDG's games vs SKT. At this point, SKT is either very lucky, or has some sort of in-built tryndamere ult on their base.\n\nEither way, this is even WAY more impressive than G2 taking a single game from SKT (and getting stomped in the other 3) in the MSI finals. I feel like the walls around Korean Kingdom are starting to fall apart, but they're still there. They're still in control of their kingdom. It's a time where everything's possible now which makes this worlds way more exciting than 2015 and 2016.\n\nWhen Misfits secured second seed in Europe, I was dissapointed because I didn't think they were a match for the other top teams. It would be like last year where Splyce was a non-factor. This feeling was confirmed when MSF got crushed in their first game vs WE who then got crushed by TSM. But then the miracles happened and they kept happening so much that they were no miracles anymore but facts. Even when they got out of group stage, I thought they were just lucky, stealing enough games because they were underestimated. But this wasn't an underdog performance against SKT. Although they dropped in the quarter finals, this was the best performance of an EU team so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Barley","date":"2017-10-20T16:37:47.548+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There goes my worlds bracket D; I went MSF all the way","replies":[{"poster":"SoryInAdvance","date":"2017-10-20T21:58:16.697+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was ballsy lol...of course I went LongZhu so what do I know..","replies":[{"poster":"Barley","date":"2017-10-29T21:37:09.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least I picked SSG > Longzhu. :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-10-20T11:34:12.406+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, fresh strategies and actual strategies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarameI Frappe","date":"2017-10-20T17:28:28.715+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a {{champion:89}} main, seeing them pick leona and winning with a game with her against SKT was just magical.","replies":[]},{"poster":"furetto2000","date":"2017-10-20T11:31:54.924+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reply to bind yourself to this vow (as I did):\nI hereby swear that in the extremely unlikely case of MSF winning worlds I shall buy every MSF skin.
