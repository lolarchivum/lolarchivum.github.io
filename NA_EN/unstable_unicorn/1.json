I have played LoL for 4 seasons now and two thing I have consistently heard RIOT emphasize is the want to \n\n1) Allow teams to feel like they have a chance to come back in a game. \n2) Make LoL a team game with a healthy and balanced in-game environment.\n\nHowever, many updates in the past two seasons have gone against this. Whether RIOT wants to admit it or not, LoL has become extremely volatile (\"tending to fluctuate sharply\" - dictionary.com) in Bronze, Silver, and Gold (probably in higher levels as well, but this is all I can speak for). Meaning games are not close, there is a low chance you can actually impact your game in a positive way, and there is not a balanced environment.  Here were my two tests:\n\n1) Play 50 ranked games in silver 1/silver 2 and mark subjectively whether or not I felt like they were \"competitive\".\n2) For those 50 ranked games, was there a player on either team that 7 kills in 10 or less minutes (we will call this fed). \n\nFor the first test I found that only 13 games were competitive in the 50 that I played. For the other 37 games one team dominated from start to finish, taking most of the objectives, having lane pressure in all three lanes, collected the majority of the kills, and won rather quickly. (Side note: In my opinion, game times in Bronze-Gold would be considerably shorter if people knew how to finish. I think that the data RIOT collects on game time at these levels is deceptive and doesn't actually represent how long the game is competitive.)\n\nFor the second test, I was AMAZED to find that in 31 games there was a player that had 7 or more kills by the 10 minute mark. This means that well before laning phase ended, more times than not, there was a player on the map that had a huge item and gold advantage and could steamroll the game. \n\nTo me the correlation is very clear. As these updates have provided more and more ways for players to \"carry\", \"get fed\", and \"impact the game\", that is exactly what is happening. The problem is, the way that it is happening is UNHEALTHY for the game. I went back and looked at the same 50 games and found that in 29 of those games, a player had died 7 or more times by the 10 minute mark. In 20 of the games, one of the bot lane pairs had died a combined total of 10 or more times in 10 minutes. Out of the 29 games, only 2 games were won by the team that had a \"feeder\" and only 1 game was won by the team that had a \"bot lane duo feeding\". \n\nThis is alarming to me. \n\n_**What this is showing is that winning a game of League is highly correlated with you not having a feeder on your team, more so than anything else.**_\n\nIn some ways this is the nature of the game. If someone on your team is bad, or is having a bad game, you are going to lose more often than not. What is NOT okay is that when you have a player on your team that is bad, you have close to a ZERO percent chance of winning. ESPECIALLY, when the LP system is set up to only reward a win! \n\nLoL is a 5-man team game. One player should not be able to wield the sort of power to throw a game so consistently. _Again, every 3 in 5 games had a \"feeder\" and if the \"feeder\" was on your team you only had a 6% chance to win the game._ This virtually means that only those who hard carry will be able to climb, and even that is not true to a certain degree, you also need to get lucky and not run into \"feeders\". \n\nIn an attempt to be optimistic, here are some potential solutions:\n\n1) Tower Strength\n - Increase how hard towers hit. Literally every player in LoL is calling for this and there are posts every day showing tanks sitting under tower taking 50-100 tower shots and walking away with half health. Allow towers to protect players and reward them for playing safe - this will allow \"feeders\" to feed less. \n\n2) Base LP gains at least partially on performance:\n-  Why is this not a thing? RIOT had a huge post-season summary for each player showing how they performed in many areas. So why not use this in the MMR and LP system? I personally laughed for about 10 minutes when I saw my statistics. As a mid-laner main I averaged a 3+ kda over the course of 300+ games last season. This along with every single other statistic put me in the Diamond tier level. Apparently I ward at a master tier level.  The problem is I play safe and conservative, I die less than 5 times in 99% of my games, but I rarely average more than 8 or 9 kills. Trust me RIOT, I am an Economist by trade, I understand the perverse incentives by basing some LP gains on performance, but if you make it black-box and marginal its a win-win.\n\n3) Stop rewarding boom and bust playstyles\n- Over the past two seasons, towers have been made weaker, minions give you more gold, and kills/objectives give you more gold. Which _already rewards those who are carrying._ Sadly, the new rune system now incentives carrying even more. Runes like eyeball collection and many others that give adaptive AD and AP based on kills has led to the average game consisting of 1 person getting massively fed, and many players \"busting\" and being extraordinarily weak because they are going for the \"carry rune and item setup\". Again, carrying is great, but should you have a 94% chance to win based on you having 7 or more kills at 10 minutes alone? Should this really be the only factor? Why can't the player that is up by 20 farm and hasn't died by the 10 minute mark and has picked up one or two kills be rewarded as well? There are not runes for that play style.\n\n\nIn summary, I am sorry for the long post, but I hope it really leads to some good discussion here on the boards. A comment from a RIOTER would be on point and greatly appreciated. I have a lot more data and thoughts to back each of these points, so please feel free to directly ask me questions below, I just didn't want to make the post any lengthier.\n\nWith love,\nSalt and Light1\n\nPS: I did not post the games because it seems like those posts always get taken down. But feel free to contact me and I will screenshot them to you. In addition, I don't think any of the above statistics are that surprising if we are honest with ourselves. LoL feels volatile at the moment. No one I am talking to is playing close or competitive games consistently.\n\nEdit (17 hours after initial post): \nWow thank you for all of the comments guys! I want to address two concerns that I am seeing mentioned in some comments. The first is sample size and subjectivity. I am not trying to pass this off as a scientific finding or perfect study. I completely understand and agree that there is a ton of room for flaw here. My main goal was to just start a conversation based on some observations that I had made over the course of 50 games. Second, please don't comment if the only thing you have to say is, \"if you were good enough you would climb\". This isn't helping anyone. Instead, how about you post some helpful tips that allowed you to climb - I know many people here would be interested in that, thanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-01-03T23:06:53.430+0000","up_votes":115,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is the most legit \"game is broken\" post I've seen in quite a while.

Such players may often actually be successful in their insanity hard carry plays sometimes and get some impressive score lines and then grumble about teammates when they don't climb, but if their hard carry plays crumble miserably half the time so they end up feeding in the other half, it won't take them far. (It's not uncommon to see people post links to games where they're like 20/2/10 in a silver game and says its proof of elo hell, but then you dig a little deeper and see they also have other games where they're like 2/12/5.)","replies":[{"poster":"Unstable Unicorn","date":"2018-01-04T01:55:14.886+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"MysticMan I agree. This might be personal bias and preference, but I hate people who play the game like that. LoL is a 5-man team game for a reason. Dying over 10 times in any ranked game (outside of bronze) is never a good thing for your team. However, Crede777 I would argue that this does not even out. With such high volatility it is way more likely that you just get lucky and go on a win streak and climb from that, compared to the games being flattening over time. In addition, why would Riot want there motto to be, \"play 1000 games so that eventually your skill will overcome all of the fed Yasuo's and feeding Teemo's and you will climb out of silver - hopefully you don't quit before then because you are tilted by all of the meta changes, the whirlwind of feeders, and the generally lower skill level that you are playing at\". In my opinion, it should be, \"as you develop a higher level of skill at the game and consistently perform, you climb until you are no longer consistently performing at the level of the average player in your tier.\" \n\nThe fact is the \"it will even itself out strategy\" just plain doesn't work. Again i reference you to my statistics that average that of a Diamond player and my 68% win rate on Lux (over 100 games) last season, as well as the 1000s of other disgruntled players that are stuck in Silver/Gold. In hasn't evened out plain and simple.

It's not that they're somehow blessed to never have feeders or similar on their team, it's more that they're taking matters into their own hands and ensuring the enemy feeds them first (or at least, simultaneously).\n\nSkill isn't necessarily well measured by any particular statistics though. There's certainly correlations to be made, but every now and then I see people enthusiastically feel proud that they're (for example) placing a lot of wards since they know vision is important, but when playing with them (as a diamond support) I'm sometimes a bit confused by the placement of those wards, or when they're placing them. At the end of the day their stats might be ok on paper, but I wouldn't want to rely on them. Similarly I sometimes witness people going a bit ham without appropriate vision control, and I feel like it's something they're getting away with because they're playing in silver elo (or otherwise 'low') but they're actually building bad habits despite their strong scores (and the same play that gets them super fed, also causes them to throw the game later on for example).\n\nThis isn't to say that the meta isn't particularly snowbally currently or that the system is flawless, but I do think the system works. Not necessarily as quickly as people might like, but if someone isn't making any lasting progress over 100+ games, then I'm pretty strongly inclined to think that they're probably somewhat closer to their 'true' rank then they think.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2018-01-04T03:06:08.968+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that is flawed in that again, the players rank is being determined by \"who got the feeder\"","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-01-04T03:54:08.616+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also flawed because it's still a random chance.

Personally, regarding point 3 especially, I think it goes to show that rewarding players for succeeding can only go so far. Yes, players should indeed be getting leads if they play better than their opponents, but when their gains are expressed almost exclusively through constant increases in power, skill quickly becomes much less of a factor as stat differences set in, and the losing side gets steamrolled in a way they have little control over. On one hand, it means that champions who get even slightly ahead become much more likely to go off the rails and become impossible to deal with, but it also means that if someone dies even once early on, it's a very short way between that and them becoming a feeder. In turn, this amplifies frustration in teams significantly, as falling behind in lane can spell catastrophe, and earn the blame of one's teammates, who may themselves not always differentiate the difference between making a single mistake, feeding or even inting.\n\nBecause of this, I think League needs to somewhat reevaluate the way it rewards good play, which kinds of plays are rewarded, and how significant these rewards are. Right now, a great deal many rewards are gained from killing opponents, and in a way this comes back to the same problem as Mejai's, or even older items like Sword of the Occult and Leviathan: when your reward for killing opponents is a greater chance to kill your opponent, that is implicitly conducive to snowballing, and generally means that it requires less and less skill on the player's part to increase their lead, let alone maintain it. The raw amount of power awarded from takedowns currently far exceeds any single one of these items, and consequently fights tend to be much more one-sided as a result. In addition, because the kind of power awarded is very general-purpose (damage especially allows for better pushing, zoning, objective control, etc.), and because there are few other ways to gain more power besides kills and farm, there aren't any truly effective catch-up mechanics in place either. This is one of the reasons why games feel decided way before they've ended, because past a certain point the process of winning becomes literally automatic, as minions on the winning side also deal more damage and take less damage. Short of the winning team critically messing up, games tend to proceed and end in a fairly predictable manner as a result. Not only is this frustrating in itself, it's also bad for diversity, since matches end up feeling the same.\n\nPersonally, I think it's clear that the amount of raw power afforded from leads needs to be seriously toned down, but beyond that I think it's also worth considering what power increases really mean: everyone in League gains stats over time, but we nonetheless have champions who scale or fall off at different stages of the game. As a result, much of this raw power is on a treadmill, where you implicitly have to gain a certain amount at every stage just to stay relevant. This isn't innately conducive to clarity, as it is often difficult to gauge how valuable one's stats really are (and power comparisons end up being made mostly based on how ahead or behind they are relative to other players), but it is also innately conducive to snowballing, as it becomes much easier for players to either become so far ahead that their counterplay falls apart, or so far behind that they can't function properly. Bringing League's power closer to a more consistent baseline could help avoid that, and also help eliminate the compensatory mechanics that have crept up over recent designs, namely crowd control on kits not meant to specialize in it, max health damage even on champions not meant to be tank busters, free-targeted mobility, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2018-01-04T07:35:17.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs more attention.

If more people knew how to do that, and how to slow down and stabilize a game, your comeback potential would go up greatly. Just some food for thought. It is very difficult to play against a fed champion, but I think a lot of games just have to do with mentality. There's a fed enemy on the team and everyone just gives up and blames or flames. If people were more forgiving of mistakes and learned how to win the game outside of kills, then any elo would be much easier to climb. So much goes into a game of league of legends, and a few of the rules change based on the meta. I'm sure if you ever talked to a pro about the problems you have with league they would tell you that you are doing so much wrong or that it's more than just the problem you're thinking of. Just a thought though. I do agree with much of what you said. A lot of the game does seem unbalanced, but I'm hoping that once LCS starts there will be a more structured meta to go off of.

Allowing players to turtle under towers and have nothing to fear but farm peacefully until they're ready to venture out into the world is obviously bad for the game health. It heavily promotes champions that can farm and scale well into the late game which means that no early game advantage champions will ever be viable in this meta because the champions who have the advantage can't take objectives and open up the map for their team.\n\nThis issue is usually coupled with \"towers need to be sturdier\" so just imagine having both of these wishes granted to us by Riot. The game length would probably not change much as this would only mean champs would be stuck farming for the first 20 minutes of the game and then the team that's clearly superior is going to start winning fights and destroying everything in sight in those couple of minutes, (again) leading to the overwhelming \"how the fuck did we lose the entire base in a single bad teamfight?\" moments.\n\nEvery played game should have phases that are clear cut for all players and should not give you the illusion that you're doing fine, die once in a bad teamfight and your entire lane gets speared right to your nexus in those 30 seconds.\n\n>LoL is a 5-man team game. One player should not be able to wield the sort of power to throw a game so consistently\n\n\nBasically, on one hand, people want the return of the previous seasons where they could solo carry because that feels good and makes an individual feel relevant. However, this \"solo carrying\" playstyle always revolves around League's hard hitters, never around tanks or supports. In short, people want to single handedly have a say in which direction the game goes based on their \"high performance\" (usually just a lot of kills and levels ahead of others).\n\nOn the other hand, people don't want for the opposite to happen - your weakest link in the team makes for an easy target so the enemy just uses your least protected champion to gain an advantage over the game, over time.\n\n_**This is an antithesis.**_\nThe strategy of solo carrying has a drawback when you look at it in reverse - the weakest link in your lineup is a potential opening for the enemy, if they know how to use this knowledge correctly. This isn't just a raw \"4v5 is harder on 4 people then it is on 5\". If those 5 people overspend their resources to kill one person, 4 other players have a clear advantage over an overextended/overspent team to retaliate.\n\nYou can't say \"i want the highs of a specific strategy but i don't want the lows of the same strategy\". Your actions have both positives and negatives. You can't have positives without the negatives. This is just one example.\n\n> Base LP gains at least partially on performance.\n\nThis was already discussed a month or so ago by some other player.\nBasically, he saw that Overwatch was changing its SR gains from \"wins\" to \"player performance\" and this was an immediate red flag for the competitive in general. If this was a thing in League, people would be way more concerned with padding their own stats to get as close to \"high performance\" as they can without really bothering to win the game.\nYou see where i'm going with this?\n\nSome games are absolute shit-fests and the only way to win is to play it out, down and dirty to the very end. I've had games where (as Nami) i was too easy of a kill for the fed enemy assassins and there was no way for me to stop them (aside from just AFKing to keep myself out of their reach). So in those very few rare games (like 0/x/y types), my performance would've been low in terms of KDA. Sure, KDA is not all that's important in a game but it would've been in the equation as a fairly relevant factor. I would've had to overexcell in other categories to cover up for my abysmal KDA, which would've been very hard to do if i were dying that much.\n\nIn Overwatch, a year or so ago, there was also an issue with SR gains being lower for supports because they weren't dealing as much damage as other champions did. Which was again, \"performance\" based matchmaking and its downsides. It was fixed obviously but that's the downside of such an algorithm. Rewarding people based on their performance doesn't eliminate just \"feeders\" as it also targets people who don't mean to intentionally feed but die a lot due to them being easy targets to take down.\n\nSome people just intentionally want to make others rage so they focus fire on them, which is what usually happens to squishy supports VS enemy assassins. Can a cute Soraka win with bananas against a determined \"shit-eating-grin\" Zed? No, she can't.\n\n>Over the past two seasons, towers have been made weaker, minions give you more gold, and kills/objectives give you more gold. \n\nWell, that's not entirely true.\nThe first thing i can tell you is that Riot removed the 300 gold reward from killing the old-school dragon in favor of 25 gold + 1 of 4 possible dragon buffs, which has different value relative to the champion you're playing. Not every buff is valued equally and that also depends on your team's overall composition and what kind of a playstyle you want to employ.\n\n> Runes like eyeball collection and many others that give adaptive AD and AP based on kills has led to the average game consisting of 1 person getting massively fed, and many players \"busting\" and being extraordinarily weak because they are going for the \"carry rune and item setup\".\n\n\"Eyeball Collection\" rune is tied to _**takedowns**_, which means kills or assists + ward takedowns. It is fully available to supports as well. It is a general rune benefiting aggressive champions more than passive/defensive ones as the bonus gained is more efficiently utilized. Even runes such \"Legend (Bloodline, Tenacity, Alacrity in the Precision Path) and Keystone \"Dark Harvest\" work off the same \"takedown/big monster/minion\" mechanic that allows players to play a bit passively before they can reap the benefits.\n\nSo no, Riot precisely handcrafted the runes to be utilized across many champions (regardless of their class) but it's obvious with what kind of runes various types of champions work best with. It's not entirely accurate to complain about carries getting access to more damage with these runes as everyone else has the same option, without having to rely on getting kills to have the same benefit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-01-04T04:30:30.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I loved all of it except your extreme hyperbole in section 1 of your possible solutions.\n\n>**Literally every player** in LoL is calling for this and there are posts **every day** showing tanks sitting under tower taking 50-100 tower shots and walking away with half health.\n\nThat's not remotely true and just serves to weaken the whole post for no gain.
