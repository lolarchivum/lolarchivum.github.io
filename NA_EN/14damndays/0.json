They did not communicate with their team, they didn't discuss anything either, they simply walked in lobby, announced he was gonna play his way and everyone else would have to adapt to it, if not, then too bad. Ignoring or straight out refusing to change your \"strat\" even when begged by your team. That is not communicating. And this is exactly what Nubrac does aswell.\n\nHonestly, Riot is probably just \"scared\" of doing something after all these scandals they have had in the last few months. We know they can't handle PR without ending up offending anyone. Everytime they try to fix a scandal, they create another one for it. Nubrac is basically using loopholes so he's technically \"playing legit and not trolling\" because he's trying to win and the game doesn't have a set of rules that dictates what champion and where to play them. So Riot can't really just straight ban him without another retaliation scandal and they're avoiding it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jng Account","date":"2020-02-09T13:35:58.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Lies.
