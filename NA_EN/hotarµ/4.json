The animation of walk i think could be done better, but still much better than the old. \n\nThis isn't the Morde i knew nor anyone close to him, the only thing that is left from old one(very badly) is the AoE Dmg, this is a completely different champion. Just like Aat rework. \n\n1st of all i don't like  that he became more of an aa champ. I mean he holds Nightfall... A mace bigger than his head and swings it like {{champion:114}}   with her sword?? Old Mord Q was enchanting his aa's, which was awesome addition, but now all u have to do rather Q and sometimes E is aa, because you cant kill ppl with passive only.\n\nPassive - I don't like that they moved old W into passive which works on champs and monsters only, 0 space to use it differently than just straight fights. Just remember what ppl could and would do. And the 40% ap dmg on aa... forces you to build attack speed for more success and more weird looking thing.\n\nQ - I like the Q, Decent dmg source, not bad at farming if you have ap, but it could be better. (bad thing imo for an aa based juggernaut)\n\nW - Not  that bad, but i'd like to have the old shield  back, just \"shield\", decaying, 40-50% heal from the remaining shield and over, not that useful especially against {{champion:58}} , {{champion:240}}  and other shield/heal reducing champs like them, again no way to use it in different situations.\n\nE - This is something the old Morde lacked. The Mobility in the game is just too *** much and immobile champs like Morde really needed this(especially the backwards cast to prevent people from chasing, that part is super amazing)\n\nR - I am feeling bad, but this is the Worst part of Morde right now.\nThere are 3 ways 1 - you just **** die after he casts  without any chance. 2 - you just {{item:3140}}  it, which means it did nothing. 3 - you are a champion like \n{{champion:11}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:48}}( aa based champs) or decent adcs. I  dont know why ppl think \"ult adc = dead adc\" its wrong, adcs with attack speed just beat the shit out of u, you wont believe, maybe even downvote the post, but {{champion:22}} is one of the best. And keep in mind that an adc with brain always have {{item:3140}} if Mord isn't bad.\n\n10% of base stats..... Really? That's all they imagined for the ultimate reward?!?! 10% of useless stats for a VERY short duration? Most champions 10% is  5-20, so if you want significant changes, you have to kill FED {{champion:113}}  {{champion:45}} {{champion:154}}\nI am not talking about it giving AD! Nothing in his kit scales with AD(another proof of being an aa champ which ruins the champ).\nAnd what about the bugs in there? Such as being stuck near(not right next to) the borders, and not being able to walk sideways and ONLY backwards. Constantly Q not dmging and  a lot other.\n\nThe skins... oh man What... THEY. ALL. ARE. HORRIBLE. \nLooking on them in game for less than a minute to understand that they didn't pay attention to them AT ALL. Especially the Pentakill.... The most important. \nThe level of disrespect is just over 9000, not even for Mord mains.\nThe music, What is that random heavy metal sounds... For fk sake not even a pentakill one for the skin. And  don't tell me \"its 975 rp, low cost, so there shouldn't be things like that\" That's BS and you know it.\n\n\nI am not playing him anymore because the effect of hype is over and now i clearly see  what this champ is.\n\nThanks For reading all this.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-28T09:57:36.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mordekaiser steals 10% of the enemy's **total** stats, NOT base stats.

It's great that he finally has some CC of his own and isn't reliant on outside sources (Such as {{item:3116}} and/or the CC of other team members). His E is quite telegraphed and dodgeable, but also has a good sense of reward if you pull it off and land a good Q with it.\n\nHis W is good, although I sometimes think the \"fall-off\" or decay rate is almost too quick, as (While some could say the difference is negligible, it IS quite noticeable when I recall my time with the old Morde) 1 second in comparison to 1.5 Seconds (The old Morde shield decay rate, you can even check the LOL Wiki, as it is from where I am getting this info) since especially in this Damage-High meta as we have, .5 seconds can be the difference between life and death at times. The rate at which it decays isn't a problem, just it feels that the amount of time before it does, well, like I said, seems too quick at times.\n\nLove his new Q, and the damage multiplication on a single target is a worthwhile callback to the old 3-hit, multiplying Q. But at the same time, I think the old multiplying damage was an interesting and unique concept, even among Juggernauts and I would love to see that back, perhaps in a reworked Juggernaut kit, or perhaps even a brand new one, as long as the idea matches said Juggernaut's theme.\n\nNow his R. While it's sad you can no longer turn fights into 6v4s, if you can slay your target in the realm, the 10% core stats you gain CAN help turn a fight around, but of course it all depends on how the fights OUTSIDE your Death Realm are going too; if you won your fight but your team still lost theirs, well...  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThen, there are times when the 7 seconds serve more of a utility-aspect, where you don't care if you win or lose the fight IN the Death Realm; you're just removing a threat from your team for as long as you can. If you can kill them, more power to ya; if not, hopefully your team can still act on the removal and sweep up the rest of the enemy team while you're keeping said threat occupied.\n\nAll in all, I say it's a successful rework. He has clearly defined strengths and weaknesses, and while I don't like the fact that QSS {{item:3140}} literally nullifies his ult (They changed it to where it doesn't cleanse Zed's Death Mark, so why is it suddenly OK to nullify Morde's?) I'm not on the Gameplay or Balance team and can't make decisions on that.\n\nOverall, this metalhead gives a thumbs up. https://i.giphy.com/media/oX9ow6cx76sZO2Vb5B/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-28T09:45:27.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That QSS removes Morde's ultimate is a needed layer of counterplay.\n\nDon't forget that pulling enemies in the death realm also removes objectives like dragons and baron for them. If you couldn't QSS the ability, then Mordekaiser would become the ultimate objective control.\n7 seconds are an eternity in a situation like contesting an objective. If both teams try to get it, then Morde could simply ult the enemy jungler, making them unable to interact with the objective.\n\nWhich means that for 7 seconds, Mordekaiser's team is the only one with smite available. And in such a situation, it is almost guaranteed that Mordekaiser's team will get the objective.\nHowever, QSS gives the jungler the opportunity to buy this item and even if he gets ulted, he can immediately cancel it by using the item active and can proceed to contest the objective with his own smite.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2019-08-28T15:05:26.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing stopping the enemy team from taking unsealed spellbook and switching to smite.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-28T15:20:46.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing stopping you from simply ulting the guy without QSS or ulting someone with QSS on CD, either.\n\n__________________\n\nYou shouldn't be forced to commit your keystone _and_ your summoner spell just to get the same chance at objectives as the enemy team.\n\nAlso, that Mordekaiser forces you to buy QSS is already an advantage.

Whereas before most of his abilties relied on him getting into harms way with basic attacks or the shroud he could put out from his W. His E also lacked the range his current kit has now. Not to mention his basic attack range now mirrors that of his weapon of 175 units whereas his old kit had him at 125 units. A significant difference in how his kit feels when played. \n\n\nSecond there is now a pertinent reason for his shield gauge to exist besides being a 'secondary life bar'. It provides himself, enemies, and allies to gauge how large his shield might be when he activates W for damage mitigation or healing. \n\n\nI would argue his kit then and now are equally overloaded, previously overloaded for all the niche reasons, currently overloaded for all the general reasons. His current kit is completely self contained whereas his previous kit was dependent on when drake was available, what minions, pets, champions were near you, and weather or not you had the health to spend for his costs. Now it all plays to his character as a walking mass of metal that is a juggernaut of pain and despair, striking mighty blows with his mace and encapsulating his victims in the clutches of the dying. Instead of being a near meme of metal jokes and song titles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2019-08-27T19:40:34.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the Ghost, and I wish they would've ported Iron Man in over Indestructible.\n\nOther than that, he's cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2019-08-27T19:01:49.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it quite a bit more than his old design actually.

Kinda stupid that his main, reliable source of damage was pointing people to death...\n\nNew passive was interesting to get used to.
