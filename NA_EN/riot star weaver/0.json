In Patch 8.24, we&#039;ll be releasing updates for Anivia, Dr. Mundo, Gragas (VFX only; SFX shipped in patch 8.21), and Teemo. Keep an eye on this post and we&#039;ll add visual previews as they become ready! Please try them out on the PBE&mdash;especially if you&#039;re a main&mdash;when they&#039;re in and leave us your feedback here!\r\n\r\nToday&#039;s preview covers the visual effects updates to **Anivia, The Cryophoenix**. Audio will also continue to be polished with mix and clarity in mind. Her idles and emotes will also have a bunch of feathery wing sounds!\r\n\r\n**VFX**\r\nVFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity.\r\nBA - New missile and hit impact.\r\nP - Glow should be more emphasized as to where she is in the rebirth process, as well as a more impactful hatching moment!\r\nQ - Should more clearly communicate the hit box, with an emphasis on the &quot;sweet spot&quot; center.\r\nW - Updated models for the wall, and a frosty ground!\r\nE - Missile is distinct from the basic attacks. &quot;Crit&quot; Impact is now brighter and more defined.\r\nR - The ultimate has a Freljordian indicator, with a **swirling blizzard**!\r\n\r\nAnivia&#039;s Blackfrost and Carnival skins have had their VFX tweaked as well. To keep with the spirit of the skins, only minor adjustments were needed:\r\n- Blackfrost&#039;s Q and R were updated to reflect the changes in base, as to not feel like they lost their uniqueness or power as a legendary.\r\n- Carnival Anivia&#039;s ultimate ring was adjusted to better match the hitbox.\r\n\r\nPlease use this thread to give feedback on Anivia&#039;s VFX. Please leave any questions about other champs to their thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Mitsuki","date":"2018-11-03T00:40:31.081+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Anivia one trick here, would it be possible for you to freshen up Anivia's character model?

It's pretty, but it just feel like the brightness was turned up to 12 and it hurts my eyes - Also, with a little lower brightness, the shape of the projectile would be much clearer.~~\nAlso, there's been a visual issue on the Q indicator (on all skins) since... Well, really since that old rework, where it just doesn't line up anywhere near where champions actually visually are. You can actually see this pretty clearly (for the small hitbox at least - this doesn't show any suspiciously-missed stuns) in the sample clip during the Q at 1:03, and the one right after it at 1:06. I'd hope this would be somewhat fixed on the visual update...\n~~W - That wall is a lot closer to white than Anivia's signature blue, which is quite jarring against the color scheme we've come to know and love. Again, looks too bright, a bit too artificial/opaque for the color - more like marble than ice, more Demacian than Freljord. If whiter ice is really what you want to go with here, it'd be a bit less jarring if it seemed more translucent, or at least a deeper color.~~\n~~E - The triple-shot is visually inconsistent with its effect. There are not 3 hits happening, just 1, and it looks quite strange for an effectively rectangular projectile like that to be coming out of the smooth activation animation. If you *must* keep the triple-shot visual for clarity, please at least group them closer together so it looks more streamlined/less blocky. Regardless, I don't think the old animation was anywhere near as misleading as this one.~~\nR - It's very pretty. It's a little bit visually distracting. Personally I'd prefer it toned down juuust a tad, but this one's really pretty close to okay, again assuming you really want a more white color scheme.\n\nBlackfrost:\nQ - Fine\n~~R - There's a bit of black wind that goes *just* over the top of the circle, which is intended to show the back-side of the 3D object that is the blizzard, but it also unintentionally extends the range of what looks like the top end of the circle around the ability's range, if you're not looking closely. This seems bad for visual clarity, especially in teamfights.~~\nFrost - Is there any plan to change the color on her frost effects to something darker on this skin? The new frost effect's bright aesthetic, especially compared to the new Blackfrost's accentuated dark/purplish colors, ~~clashes pretty badly.~~(on twitter update: not quite as bad, since the skin has a bit more of that color in its animations to match - or maybe it just looks better on this spot in the map, I don't know for sure)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Star Weaver","date":"2018-11-05T21:33:24.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!! Thank you so much for the feedback! VFX artist here. I actually appreciate that It's quite a bit of a rundown, so I'll give my thought process on everything to match :)\n\nSo the reason I made everything a little bit brighter is for visual hierarchy in our game. The brighter something is, the more attention is drawn to it. Her Q was getting lost in teamfights sometimes, and bringing up the brightness makes it more noticeable on all fronts. Ice is normally on the whiter side of things, and when I brought some deeper blues in with a lot of her VFX (I'm mostly looking at her ult here in this example), it was giving me overlap with other champion's VFX. There were a lot of concerns early in playtest that the R felt like a Ryze ult when I pushed deeper blues in it. Still, with that being said, I can tone down the glow on her Q by like... 10-20%, and that could help a tad? \n\nAlso, for the hitbox on her Q, I didn't want to change what players were already used to on that ability. Funny enough, I actually was trying to test out the hit box on it to see if I could stun an Annie with the wonkiest of angles and just the BARREEEE edge of it, and the hitbox is actually pretty accurate! The timeboxes you pointed out in the sample clip do actually do what they are intended to do (The first one, Annie is not in the ring, the second one, she is). \n\nThe W was also pushed closer to white in order to bring up attention and clarity around it (See point above). I'll probably go in and bring in about 30% more blue into it, but the main reasoning I made it whiter is to actually stand out a bit when you use it in conjunction with the R. It actually creates an effect that pushes each other out.\n\nAs for the E, I'll be changing that into a single icicle today with trailing shards rather (As decided by popular vote!).\n\nI'll see if I can tone down the R ever so slightly, but I have it that crazy because I was actually getting feedback that it was being lost a little in teamfights somehow (like, WUT). I also wanted to bring in a more aggressive blizzard feeling rather than a soft snowy feeling. But yeah, as I stated above, the deeper blues pushed it to looking more like a Ryze ult and I was getting overlap of that from playtest feedback. \n\nTo be honest, I'm really excited to see these changes go out to PBE, and I'd actually really like to see what your feels are after playing the new changes. The choices I made on her VFX are a little on the subtler side and I personally believe that it improves how she feels to play.\n\nI'll look into the dark wind on the R with blackfrost to see if I can make it match the hitbox a bit more accurately as you're describing. As for the frost, if you're talking about the slow effect that plays on Annie, that's actually the global slow effect and it's something that I unfortunately don't have the ability to change for gameplay reasons.\n\nBUT YEAH. Thanks again for the feedback! It really does help to understand what other Anivia mains are feeling!","replies":[{"poster":"MoveslikeQuagger","date":"2018-11-06T16:38:08.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, wow, I really appreciate the direct response/thought process! I posted another comment already about my thoughts on the more recent update, but that was before noticing this comment.\n\nOn brightness - I *reeally* like the newer version of the Q, a lot. I do hope that's visibly clear enough, because it feels like just the right amount of brightness. Same goes for the wall - feels more icy/anivia-ey, while still popping. (There may be an acceptable case to bring a *tiny* bit of the blue back out, but not a ton imo)\n\nOn the Ryze Ult comparison - Now that you mention it, yeah, that makes a lot of sense, especially given the new runic flair. Perhaps it could help to have more solid-looking icy particles tossed in there, or for a more work-intensive overhaul, replace some swirling movement for a more boiling-spaghetti-patterned effect? For now, though you said you didn't want it to feel \"soft/snowy,\" it really does look a bit like a swirling snowglobe (which detracts from the \"dangerous ice storm\" image), and I don't think the speed of it is the main issue. (Again, this version isn't so bad. Part of the visibility issue may be the light-colored ring? Though, the live version gets lost in teamfights a surprising amount as well, to which I attribute half of Anivia's currently positive winrate, the other half being the Akali matchup)\n\nOn the Q indicator - With those timestamps, I was more talking about the timing with which annie was hit with the first part of the ability than the actual circle around it. You'll notice she *appears* to be almost at the edge by the time she's hit by the first half - having the circle there as a reference only brings attention to this. I realize this is due to Z-axis/skillshot interactions, it's just reeeally obvious how wonky it can be with such a slow and calculated projectile.\n\nOn the E - Thank you. I know the triple-shards was your baby, but it didn't feel as powerful to throw out as the single leading one does.\n\nRegardless of all this, your work is beautiful, please help us convince the modeling department to fix Anivia up to her new spells' standards\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Star Weaver","date":"2018-11-06T18:53:18.451+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i'm really glad I get to hear what everyone thinks! So thank you x 100000 again for the feedback!!\n\nOH! That's what you meant about the Q. YEEAHHH... I totally wish I could change how that behavior is, but it is a Z-axis issue as you said. If I change that, it changes the whole feel of the ability, which traditionally, changes how people feel about playing a champion in a negative way. (I'm talking about the subtlety how it FEELS to play a champion vs. the visuals of how something looks and feels). Ahhh still probably not explaining that properly, sorry!\n\nHMMM. I'll see what I can do to add a little more defined shapes in the ult (I think that's what you're getting at here :), but It's also now nearing the point where noise becomes a huge play and that's the balancing act.

Can you make her a bit more feathery and birdy in that regard? A flying animation similar to Phoenix from Dota would certainly look very nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-11-04T01:18:01.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this - my favorite birdy enters the modern era :D\n\nTwo minor, *minor* nitpicks:\n\nOne is the ice wall animation. Currently, it's a smooth melt out and really looks like how you'd expect rapidly melting ice to look. The new version kinda sits there for a bit, and then quickly jumps under the ground as the timeout ends - it's a bit jarring, and II wish the smooth fade was still there.\n\nAlso more of a question - why does base Ani not have any falling ice on her ult now, but Blackfrost and Festival Queen do? As I understand it, this is a visual indication that the ult is at max size and is doing extra damage. That feedback is now gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Satakieli","date":"2018-11-03T19:02:41.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia OTP here, I absolutely love the new AAs and the R outer circle symbols, however, there are 2 things that bother me a little:\n\n1: The wall. It doesn't look like ice, and while I like the frosted ground idea, I think it could've been represented better. Right now it looks like a messy white mixed with the map's ground. Feels like an exaggerated smudge+blur in Photoshop, IMO. But I might just be a personal complaint.\n2: I like how the R's outer circle expands and fades in from a blurry blue, and then becomes a clear contour with runes and cool symbols and whatever you see there, but I think the transition is too sudden. Like 'hey that R is gloriously expanding' and then 'OH WAIT IT'S FULL already? Did I miss a frame?'. It feels like a lag :(\n\nBut again, I might be biased. Great work overall, I'll have to say this again: I simply love the AA missiles. Tiny, sharp icy things which don't look like a winter's goddess wrath at first, but that will quickly eat away all of your HP during the laning phase.

In skin Carnival and BlackFrost the wings are ok! Another thing in the original skin: the wings beat too slowly, as it is slow the flapping of wings becomes even stranger to those who play with her. Quinn's Valor flies a lot more beautiful for example than the Anivia! She looks more like a bluebird flying strange than a bird ice goddess.\nThe self-attack is ok for me but I miss ice in general\n\n(Q) is ok but I miss cold, maybe fractals of ice;\nThe ice wall \n\n(W) got super interesting but it's missing a bit of snow and cold in my opinion. I hope that with this rework projectile attacks are blocked by the \"ice wall\" as they are blocked by the \"Yasuo wind wall\" because it makes no sense the wind blocking projectiles and an ice wall does not...\n\nThe (E) is amazing with three pieces of ice, although I think they should be spaced out just like the Q of Twisted Fate;\n\nThe (R) looks beautiful but I see more wind than cold and ice, I think it is fitting to make icy adjustments in general for her.\n\nAnd speaking of your passive (P) I miss cold on your sides, it's an icy egg and with that, she needs a cold wind circulating the egg!\n\nAs a cold champion, she has to bring this to the battlefield.\n\nI am the snow, wind, and ice. {{champion:34}} \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
