It's me, Carnival Knights, lead skins writer and growing twitter problem. I've come to you today with a burning question only you, boards, can answer: what are you looking for in **alt universe lore** for 2019? Short stories? Long stories? Comics? Another 27000 words worth of skin bios (yes, last year saw 27000 words worth of skin bios, and we'll probably match it again this year)? Deeper legendary VO? Interactions? Tell me your heart's desire. This isn't a trick. I am not tricking you.\n\nBut wait! Before you answer, this question comes with a couple caveats. One, I can't guarantee any particular skin universe is worked on, now or in the future. I don't make those calls, though I am part of the conversation and can at least advocate for certain lines to get more love. So if you want to see some really deep Leprechaun Veigar lore go ahead and ask for it. What's stopping you? Nothing, that's what.\n\nTwo, time and bandwidth constraints are extremely real, so I can't always knock out a 5000~ word novella for every single skinline. I'm always looking at new styles of writing and applications of narrative storytelling for new and existing universes, and I'm keeping an eye on lines I get a lot of requests for (I've seen your Eclipse posts. All of them), but even if X universe shows up again in a product roadmap I can't 100% say it will see a story/comic/cinematic/etc.\n\nThree, I can't confirm anything that hasn't already been announced. You know the drill. Sorry, Spideraxe specifically.\n\nWith those points out of the way, feel free to ask or request whatever you feel like, and I'll do my best to answer or elaborate throughout the day.

A lot of the main lore is outdated and is more connected to (it is) the established universe. There is so much more room to explore there that I don't feel expanding a 'non canon' lore really would accomplish much or even help sell the skins.\n\nThe best Riot can do to help sell the skins is build up the skins in some sort of 'short cinemati' similar to what was done with the... uh...  odyssey(?) Skins.\n\nI feel that skins should stay as a marketing tool to make money based off of design and intrigue of w.e set they belong to.\n\nThe story wouldnt really offer much and doesnt effect much either, imo.\n\nHope that didnt come off too negative, especially if you and/or other rioters are more passionate about those alternate storyline.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-01-17T22:21:38.622+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's nothing bad about being honest, so don't feel like you have to apologize! That said:\n\nWhile I understand the alt fiction isn't for everybody, the idea that it should only be used as a marketing tool and never otherwise (or even that people don't want to engage with it) is directly contradicted by player engagement data. Not just contradicted, but _massively_ contradicted. I wish I could be more specific than that, but the numbers are... I will say even I was a bit surprised.\n\nThere is also no real overlap between alt fantasy writing and main lore writing, so there is no risk of the main lore being hampered by what we do over on alt fiction.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Kaiju","date":"2019-01-17T23:19:53.739+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"First comment: Regarding overlap, I'm more concerned by the idea that development of AUs is taking precedence OVER the main universe being developed (the main universe is the core of the game, and heavy investment in stories that have no impact on it as it sits for long periods of time gives the impression that it has been deemed unworthy of that investment itself.) \n--------\nFor the body of your comment: \n\nSomething that's been eating at me for a while: \nIs the lore behind the AUs more popular because nearly every time they are released alongside cinematics and medium-to-large scale in-game events? \n\nIs the reason most people don't engage with the base lore because it seldom gets that treatment? \nI'm curious about the impact of the lore that came out with the Ryze cinematic (although I do believe it had a decent delay and I'm unsure about how it was linked to in the client. \n\nBut I'm most curious about the player reception of the recent-ish Lissandra, Vel'Koz, and Frozen Watchers lore updates. They were linked with a big, beautiful image inside of the actual client itself and I would honestly love for more main lore to be released this way. It feels like many lore updates are honestly self-sabotaged due to the lack of access to new players or means to attract people to them. How much of an impact did this have? Did Vel'Koz experience a spike in playrate? Did people flock to read the stories? \n\nThe universe site was a good step, and it is really cool for people who are ALREADY invested in the Lore, but can be overwhelming to people who are new to it. Linking lore updates alongside associated art (the art which came with the recent lore updates, in particular the one for Veigar, are also great examples of things that could be links on the client itself when they are released.) \n------------\n\nOne last thing that I feel likely impacts the reception of AUs vs the regular story is that the AUs inherently contain progress. You move through a piece of their story from beginning to end, there are often stakes for the characters. Main lore tends to not do this and I am wondering when (if ever) the main plot of runeterra itself will begin picking up steam. \n\nBilgewater had consequences. It is the only, or one of the only, main universe lore stories that does. (Taliyah also does very well in this regard, but it wasn't made available very well and has been left sitting for a very long time). Everybody I speak to about Bilgewater either loved the event or wishes they had been there for it. I know it was a huge resource investment, but there must be smaller ways to get a similar result and make people fall in love with the main universe lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2019-01-18T01:42:25.076+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"_\"We have data showing an overwhelming amount players engage with alt-universe stories\"_\n\nWell, of course. Unlike stories released for the main universe, AU lore usually come packed with pages of art, cinematic content, and related in-game cosmetics like skins or wards (sometimes new maps and game modes, too). \n\nEven when the main canon _does_ get significant narrative content, such as regional/faction updates, they tend to skew their focus towards popular champions like Lux or Miss Fortune, who get additional art and stories. It's like every little thing Riot does these days is driven by player data and statistics. I understand that position from a business perspective, I get why it's necessary, but as a player with more niche interests, it is endlessly frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-01-18T18:07:23.918+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was super hype when I saw Nocturne's spot in Demacia on the Universe map and the implication of a Quinn VGU with the Demacian ... raptor ... things, or at least a lore update for her (Pose aside, I dont think Quinn's visuals are bad anyway.) \n\nOf course, not going to happen because Quinn doesn't sell skins.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-01-17T21:41:59.130+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I'm inclined to agree with the main points in that statement, one thing needs to be clear for other people...\n\nThe writers for skin lore do their work separately for the development of prime lore content.

Not through Pulsefire wibbly wobbly timey-wimey stuff (although Pulsefire wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff is a lot of fun), I mean making them into one organically shared universe.\n\nSpeaking of shared universes, putting Steel Valkyries together with Odyssey would be a ton of fun, in my opinion. I think this would be a more obvious thing than the former, and it might already be true (because we don't know the second universe Odyssey is connected to yet, if I'm correct). \n\nAn Eclipse short story for sure! Everyone was begging for one when the universe was given some lore and the skins came out; if they have another event this year, there should definitely be a short story for it. \n\nAnd in general, more skin universe lore that brings the actual champions of the universe together and lets them interact, because there's not enough of it yet in my opinion. \n\nBringing some more outlying skins into other universes is something I'd like as well, such as putting Viridian Kayle as an angel of the Emerald Chapel and Blackthorn Morgana as her Coven goddess sister who fell, which many are expecting. \n\nWell, that's my two cents on skins.

Huge general lore fanboy here (skins included, naturally). Some opinions/asks:\n\nVO is a huge, huge deal for me personally. It's how a champion gives life to the alt-verse they're from, it's what gives them character, it's what gives them that _feeling_ of being a real (well..relatively real) person in their own world. VO has been a tipping point when purchasing skins for me (hello, GGMF). Interactions with related champions in-universe, items and in game events with their own spin on them, and random asides talking about where they're from/the world they live in can really make a skin stand out. I think the Eclipse skins (Solar/Lunar Eclipse Leona) really sold that alt-universe witch-knight fantasy quite well in terms of VO and content of said VO. I think that's the bar I'd like 2019 skin VO to adhere to if at all possible.\n\nWritten lore is also something I greatly enjoy. Worldbuilding and character building is very important to me, and when it's done well it's fantastic (See: Odyssey) and can really make a world stand out and feel whole - which is something that unfortunately isn't always the case (See: Steel Valkyries - that line is easily my favorite line in the game, and the lack of worldbuilding around it feels, well - bad). Selfish take here: I adore longer form stories. I enjoy following a narrative with a twist on the champions I'm already familiar with - Odyssey's _The Lure_ is my shining example, with High Noon's _The Man with The Grinning Shadow_ at a close second.\n\nWhich kind of brings me to my third point: maybe look to adapt and change existing skin lines and add content for them? High Noon being the example here, of course. The reimagining of the world/skin line really changed the line from being 'hey champions but WILD WEST' to 'the Frontier with champions who actually like, exist here as real people!'. It's kind of been done elsewhere, but the Infernals (as an example) didn't have anything to go with it, really; without any story or real content beyond the blurbs to back it up kind of makes the world fall flat.\n\nAnywho, those are my thoughts on skin lore and stuff.

Like, every skin should have a small bio which you can read in the Skin Collection, such kind of things bug me always if the work is only half done.\n2. The VO's are great, keep doing your work. Seriously, these have been amazing so far.\n3. Ask the Universe Team to create a better way to find all the skin stuff.

In the english writing scene it seems to be everything that is less than a short story).\n5. Crossovers. Things like that \"The Omen of the Dark\" being a fables in \"Eclipse\" is amazing. \"Odyssey\" and \"Pulsefire\" have huge crossover ability and it would be a shame not to use it.\n\nBonus Points:\n1. Already said, but Coven deserve a short story. SG is already popular enough, the short story was not needed. I know, it has been said enough and it was mentioned that they will get skin lore if these return, but I really think the Universe amazing and deserves all the love and attention it can get.\n2. If a legendary Syndra skin is in work, please make sure she feels powerful, like Leona does. I almost quite the game cause of her absolut awful Lore Update and I really hope her only shot for a legendary wont be wasted. Especially since the rumors about Anti-Star Guardian exist and it felt like a dodge a bullet that Syndra hasn't got the legendary one. Give me Cosmic or Coven Syndra, which has so much potential visual and lore wise. Something powerful. Not cute, not nice, but actually powerful and sovereign. And that she has more personality than her given lore counterpart, which sadly has none anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-01-17T22:50:28.752+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lady Faceless,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3xLpEqie,comment-id=001a,timestamp=2019-01-17T22:40:14.860+0000)\n\n> 3. Ask the Universe Team to create a better way to find all the skin stuff. Things like High Noon, PROJECT and Blood Moon are difficult to find if you don&#x27;t know where exactly to look.

Yes, taliyah tells me dozens of times to throw another rock, but the most important part of her character isn’t really seen in game, it’s seen in her lore.

Just wanted to start saying that all you guys on writing/ and the skin designers themselves have been killing it, all these events, stories,  bios,etc. have been great to see. These alt worlds have been showing their own teeth in the ground and giving feel to these characters(even if its alt stories a lot of times u can see more of the actual characters personality).  I have 2 things I'd love to see in the next year or 2:\n1. Skin line interactions with each other. I'd love with a group or team would say lines when together (new line of super galaxy the people banter to each other, or make comments about other super galaxy champs). This imo brings the alt universes to the next level where we dont just hear the stories and see a mission in a gamemode, but hear more of their personal interactions, regardless of location. I dont know how much it costs to write up and put the dynamic va  like xayah/rakan, but even 1 sided comments could be great (things like comments when a blood moon takes/gets a kill when you get an assist,  or even comments when they get a kill you arent part of but near, even like leveling up next to one another (maybe for like arcade world). Think would be really fun to get their personalities into the game, when you have the skin. Also i don't mean necessarily add these to old skins (im guessing that's too much work/has problems overall) but for the future products in these skin lines. \n\n2. Alt / older/younger versions of  characters: things like riven as a noxian general, maybe wukong more primal, yasuo before being made a traitor, xin zhao in the Colosseum, sylas as a  mage hunter :3. Alts like what if morg was good and kayle was evil, what if lamb was sadistic and wolf was kind, what if rumble went evil and trist had to take him out. Just some thoughts where skins actually give a different perspective on the actual world while also not being their cannon form. I think the alts would be best with vs events because there is a lot of characters that are foils to each other.\n\nThats just my thoughts, idk how much of this is directly in your field but love that communication and the work you guys do! Keep it up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-01-17T22:40:00.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like lots and lots of comics, if that's an option!  They're probably my favorite story-telling medium.  I'd like more long-form stories otherwise, unless the style of writing specifically works better in shorter-form (Trial of the Masks was my favorite story released the past year, alt-universe or otherwise).  I really enjoyed both Star Guardian stories, so longer stories really caught my attention.  On one hand, comics can feel \"smaller\", and if it's alt-universe content it's not unlikely we'll never get another expansion, so there are pros and cons to both formats.  I greatly enjoy both, however!\nCinematics are very cool to see, especially with unique art and animation styles, but since they're mostly promotional in nature, they don't feel good to go back to the same way other content usually is.  Looking at the Odyssey and Elementalist Lux cinematics, they both give context and actual character for the characters featured, which is awesome.  Just too trailer-y, I guess!\nI would die for more audio dramas like we got about Bilgewater last year; if you're recording VO for a new Legendary/Ultimate, you already have one of the key actors there …\n\nNitpicks about the organization of alt-universe content on Universe:\nStories without a minisite aren't easily findable in the alt-universe tab (High Noon Gothic, Blood Moon, PROJECT: Hunters stories).  Some content that was released isn't on the Universe site at all--Pentakill minisite, VS 2017 comic, a Chinese comic of Irelia/Talon from Immortal Journey.\nBasically, it'd be nice if more stuff was readily available for people to discover alt-universe content.  Stuff online that isn't collected, or stuff in the client that was never online (hello GGMF).\n\nI really enjoy the dialogue of skins like Pulsefire Caitlyn, Elementalist Lux.  Specifically, please give me more puns.\n\nThe only real request for specific content I have is something for Elementalist Lux.  I don't care how big/small (looking forward to the bio!).  Of course, I'm a huge fan of the stories released this year, and I personally think she'd be a great candidate for a soliloquy-type piece, which is something I haven't seen done in League yet.  No expectations, though! :)\nThis is also the place where I ask that not every skin need be part of a larger skinline to have its own story/universe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-01-17T22:11:45.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apology accepted {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} So I what personally want to look more into for skins lore in 2019 are just more ways of connecting stray skins in to a cohesive set. I absolutely loved what you did with Fables, Omen of the Dark, Infernal and Eclipse this year by grouping a bunch of mismatched skins under one theme. In terms of content I think I hard want more short stories for the bigger lines that haven't been explored yet like Event Horizon or Omega Squad. Deeper VO interactions are something I want more off too, I really liked your work with Eclipse Leona's VO, interacting with multiple champs, personally was less so happy with DT Heimer not having super deep interactions. In general i do want to see more skins VO interactions, like on VGU'd skins or release skins like with Irelia, Swain Kai'Sa","replies":[]}]}
