I thought that was obvious. In fact, most of the last half of his log is rule breaking. Calling them toxic, they play like trash, toxic again, reported, toxic again... jesus your friend needs to take \"toxic\" out of his vocabulary. Its ridiculous. Its like he just learned that word so now he goes around using it way too damn much.\n\nYou two should really consider looking up the rules and getting to know them. Ignorance often results in banned accounts. Knowledge is power, protect your shit. This is such a dumb way to hurt yourself. Look up the rules and maybe even go around the boards learning what is and isnt punishable. It could save his next account, and yours, since you seem to think this was all within the standards of Riots rules. Thats pretty bad you cant even recognize that calling someone trash and so bad is against the rules. But youre just being biased cuz its your friend im sure.

Someone who breaks the rules every time they play can't get away with it by only touching the account once every several months. In this game, your friend spent the entire time arguing, bickering, accusing people of feeding, telling teammates they're bad, saying that a teammate is toxic reported trash, and so on.
