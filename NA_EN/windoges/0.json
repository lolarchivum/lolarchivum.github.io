Guessing from your name i think you play karthus so you maybe know the importance of the lvl 1 in that matchup vs fizz  where you basicly set him behind on his weak lvl 1 enough so you can keep him low and pushed in until the first back where you get enough mr to survive his all in or he will get 6 on even footing and kill you whenever his ult is up without you being able to do much.","replies":[{"poster":"Karfuss","date":"2017-07-31T07:28:10.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus is something I would never play into Fizz, or any mid lane assassin for that matter. I understand that playing a mage with virtually no hard CC, against a hypermobile assassin, is a terrible idea. In the event that I was somehow forced and nobody would trade, I would play very passive, farm under turret post-6 and abuse my global threat potential.\n\nAn assassins job is to assassinate lone targets, with the odd exception like Garen, Cho and Darius, whom nobody with any sense will attempt to do. You are alone in lane, and you are no exception.\n\nAkali does that through sustain and stickiness, because she lacks the raw burst to 100-0 most things like Zed, for example, can.","replies":[{"poster":"sirwaterfles","date":"2017-07-31T16:39:01.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not odd exceptions but basicly all juggernauts, tanks , some skirmishers and most fighters.

Yes most assassins make great splitpushers but not because they can 1v1 everyone like a juggernaut but because of their great mobility.\n\nOke now onto karthus v fizz. Ofcourse you dont pick him into fizz but if you get counterpicked the lvl1 is of utmost importance. You will always have to play safe and towerhugg from lvl 6 onwards but if you only do that with your low ms and no hard cc he will still dive and kill you every time his ult is up. You need to play agresssive at lvl 1 and keep him poked down so you can build a little advantage the first few lvls so you will atleast stand a chance to survive the rest of the laningphase.\n\nYour original claim was that every assassin needs to be a lane bully the entire game in order for them to function.

Fizz's cooldowns on E at max level is 10 seconds, but will reach 6 seconds with 40% cdr and 5.5 at 45% cdr. {{item:3157}} takes out 2.5 seconds with stasis, which will give him 3 seconds of no E. Depending on how much you wanna buff Fizz's E, this would be a good idea that will balance Fizz a bit more, or make him prone to some nerfs. My idea is at max rank, his E is reduced by 1 or 1.5 seconds, or just make his scaling worse, but keep his max rank of E the same by reducing 1-2 seconds in earlier ranks, like 1-2.\n\nEdit 1: CRAP I'm dumb as hell.

He needs his Lichbane ASAP or he won't stand a chance fighting another champion, and for fighters, the reason its a joke is because they tend to have their primary waveclear/fighting skill be stupidly cheap at like 30-40 mana, if it cost mana at all.\n\nFizz doesn't have the luxury a lot of other melee fighters/assassin like him do, in the fact that he doesn't have safe cheap waveclear.  His W is cheap, sure, but requires him to auto the target twice, which means it isn't safe.  His E is fast, but puts his primary escape on CD and cost a ton of his mana pool even with the fact he rushes Lichbane, at 1/6th to 1/7th of his early-mid game mana pool.\n\n\nSure, lategame his mana pool is sustainable generally between Lichbane and the fact that he will probably get blues after the second blue, but that isn't till post 13 minutes.\n\n\nA 2 second CD buff on E (That's impact scales further down with rank, by level 5 it's only a 1 second drop and at 9 it's back to live values), Fizz in no way will be broken by this buff.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kamapelmeenid","date":"2017-07-30T15:41:23.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waiting for an ADC attack speed get buffed then there should be a line like that along: \"X-Marksman fares pretty well against anything except Rammus when his autoattacks are up, so we're giving him the tools to autoattack more often.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri a Stark","date":"2017-07-30T12:51:01.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"this buff doesn't change anything cause you are maxing e with him anyway","replies":[{"poster":"øHaruø","date":"2017-07-30T13:49:50.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you seen Fizz's E CD?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-07-30T18:03:08.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except this buff makes him stronger pre 6, when he's at his weakest (don't confuse with \"weak\").","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lit Corn","date":"2017-07-30T13:47:11.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u want to do something on fizz , buff his lowest range R dmges , nerf his highest  range R dmges , buff his Q dmges if u want to buff him but wtf why puting lower cd on his E ? so basically isntead of making fizz stronger but counterable ( cuz u can pretty much calculate his R dmges he can burst you but u can kill him too ...)  they remove his counterplay ... u dont need E to engage as fizz u use it to dodoge things or escape but man puting a lower cd on it ??? rito pls ...","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2017-07-30T15:26:28.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buff on the PBE has his E CD down by just 2 seconds at rank 1 and at the exact same as it is now at rank 5.

Which you probably wouldn't be a fan off.\nSo, while its good that's not happening with them.
