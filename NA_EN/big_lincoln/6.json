Enemy supports can typically 100-0 solo me with the meta of Zyra/Brand/Malz/MF. Without that sustain, the enemy support just forces me out anytime their is combo up.\n2. The extra LS is nice against assassins since the meta supports aren't that peel based like a Janna so I need that to survive the assassin meta.\n3. Trades with ADCs right now are typically only a couple of AAs, supports tend to do a lot of the trading. I get more value from 1 AA onto an enemy ADC with Warlords than I do with 1 auto with fervor. If I do try to go for an extended trade, I'll just have 6 voidlings on me or 3 Zyra plants AAiing outside of my AA range.\n\nI really don't see much reason to go fervor until supports like Braum/Alistar/Trundle come back into the meta where I'm losing lane because of budget midlaners that dictate botlane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-02-15T03:45:17.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Fervor of Battle has become \"necessary\" for marksmen to have a decent mid game, then where is the player choice?
