Artificial interest will only make more problems. \r\n\r\nStop dancing around the issues; if you want supports to be played more, then you need to address the role itself. They&#039;re under-leveled, under-item&#039;d, and quite frankly I think their gameplay patterns are terrible. They&#039;re not fun to play but a lot of them have been god damn infuriating to play against at their prime. Utility supports are reliant on AP, a stat they don&#039;t get enough gold to buy and can&#039;t get enough of unless they manage to stack a Mejai&#039;s or save up for items beyond their budget. Tank supports are only tanky if their pockets are lined with assist gold. Some mages have such broken base damage  that a handful of them can succeed without a gold income, and now they&#039;re starting to populate the bottom lane.\r\n\r\nDirect changes need to be made. Supports need to change to feel better to play and more fair to play against; utility supports should not require AP, or at least not as extremely as they do right now; mage supports should not have the raw numbers they do. Outside of the tanks, supports need more items that DON&#039;T give them CDR. Locket and Redemption really shouldn&#039;t be as absolutely necessary as they are. XP distribution needs to change, and not just for supports&#039; sake; we could take this chance to allow melee fighters and other carries to lane bot without relying on a bullshit snowball first-tower meta, and solve support leveling in the same swoop. \r\n\r\nwhat do you guys think","replies":[{"poster":"TricolorStar","date":"2017-01-20T18:05:20.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are many problems with the support role.\n\n1.

If those items were scaled back in effectiveness more itemization could be seen, therefore more choices, and therefore more fun.  Oh forgot to mention boots so how many item slots are you then left too play with?  Not very many and with how stompy games are right now good luck enjoying choosing that item you'll never get too build.\n\nThe strength of these items and extreme xp shortages are the major issues with support fixing those may not bring everyone flocking to the role but it would be a lot more enjoyable to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2017-01-20T19:17:00.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TricolorStar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4EI3NdrE,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-01-20T18:05:20.991+0000)\n>\n> There are many problems with the support role.\n> \n> 1.

I feel that his passive soul scaling was a great idea to add to his lantern and flay, but could have been the key to a support who, if he keeps getting souls, thats what would make him strong in a game, not having to cover the adc for their weaknesses and losing out on gold.\n\nsome games end and you and the enemy support will be so underleveled it is hilarious. Riven got fed? while she makes it to lvl 18 im still siting here at lvl 14 or 13 sometimes.\n\nIf a jungler ganks early, how likely is he to get a kill or 2? suddenly your role as support goes from maybe i can hurt the laners and help trade to, oh shit don't die. unless your a full on mage \"supporting\" you have no chance of punishing, let alone killing, an enemy jungler who knows what they are doing. your role in the game becomes team cheer leader or ff@20 because you suddenly have next to no ipact inthe game without dying in the process. \n\nThe support role does suck currently, it will almost certainly suck unless something is overtuned, or your a brand nuking the enemy botlane while ez is farming up his tear. i think that is how someone gets bored and decides to bring someone like ziggs bot, he is a fun champ who does a great deal of dmg via poke, suddnely he is the apc and now adc's are being replaced. this is hilarious to watch btw as supprts still suck. plz let adc's become cs farm bots as a role. have the mage carries replace the suppors entirely. that will spice up this meta.\n\nwow what a rant...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-20T17:43:06.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4EI3NdrE,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-01-20T17:40:19.247+0000)\n>\n> \n> what do you guys think\n\ni enjoy this situation\nbecause it's rare that i get support in high elo, most of the time i get my secondary role which is top lane.\n\nSupport is by far one of the most played role in high elo, simply because of {{champion:43}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:161}}  that are overpowered as fuck\n-lane bully\n-utility\n-AOE damage in teamfight\n\nyeah, tell me more about fixing supports\n\nthe support role is fine\nwhat isn't fine is the balance of the role","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-20T17:46:38.471+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"i even said mage supports needed to be tuned down lol. not sure if it's just them that are the problem but you barely even see tank supports b/c all 5 of those just counter them so hard. \n\n>the support role is fine\nwhat isn't fine is the balance of the role\n\nso the support role isn't fine, if it's dominated by champions that aren't even traditional supports in higher elo\n\nlike the only actual support i even see often these days is Janna. soraka lulu, even nami is a rarity now","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-01-20T18:00:37.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nop, janna and thresh are the only one\nnami is rare\nsoraka disappeared\n\neither you nerf the mages or you buff supports","replies":[{"poster":"Unironic SJW","date":"2017-01-20T19:15:12.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we had this problem with Annie 2 years ago, it was fixed by:\n\nNerfing her bases and buffing her scalings\nMaking her utility level dependent (stun gains duration at level breakpoints).\n\nAnnie is still viable at support, but she's no longer oppressive.

As I've expressed it at great length this past week in other threads I refer you to go look for my opinion there. The TL;DR is that the XP and items issue is a red herring that distracts from the real problems, and that solving the real issues will result in solo lanes and junglers losing out on fun. \n\nFor this thread, I would like to ask you a question. You, specifically, do not play support on this account. Why? \nWhy do you prefer your lane over support?\nWhat are the things you enjoy most about your role? \nWhat are the things that, if you could do them as a support, would make you play support?\nIs there a power fantasy that you think is lacking in the support role? What kind of power fantasies should exist in the support role? Which of those are denied now? What kind of power fantasy, even if it is in your mind not suited for the support role, if it exists for supports would make people who are currently playing mid, jungle and top desire the role?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-20T18:41:33.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">You, specifically, do not play support on this account.
