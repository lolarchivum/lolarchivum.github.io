Currently my 2 big LoL vibes are either *Flogging Molly* or the *Starbound Soundtrack*. My 2 main problems in LoL (which are obviously tightly tied) are reassessing my situation and tilting/raging. Having songs I like will have me keep part of my focus elsewhere in calmer situations which is great for that little \"reset\" moment.\n\nSimilarly, since they're both music that I like it really helps me not get angry at teammates and simply stop giving a fuck after a while (about that specific person, not the whole game).\n\nNote that it doesn't have to be calm music, I've played for a long time with Disturbed or Sonata Artica playing on my headset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2014-08-16T14:53:18.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I listen to either a play list of songs by instlok, plentakill and a few others\n\nor the sound track to phantom of the opera (STOP JUDGING ME)\nor a live preformance of Chess from youtube (STOP JUDGING ME)\n\nThey just help relax, and stay focused - important to remain non-toxic XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-08-16T14:34:07.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like active-sounding music.
