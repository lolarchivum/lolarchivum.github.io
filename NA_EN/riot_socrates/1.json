The team has been heads-down addressing issues and we realized it&rsquo;s past time to update where we are and where we still need to go. \r\n\r\nThe number of people playing in premades is the highest we&rsquo;ve seen in League&rsquo;s history and 98.6% of the time, premades of 4 or 5 teammates are being matched against a premade of the same size (most of the 1.4% with more divergent premade sizes come from very high and very low MMR ranges). Teams made of solos and duos are matched against a premade 4 or premade 5 only 0.21% of the time, and players queueing solo get teamed up with 4 man premades 3% of the time.\r\n\r\nMatch quality (defined by the average MMR difference between players on one team vs. the opposing team) has improved slightly, giving us closer, fairer games across all tiers of ranked play. \r\n\r\nWith the introduction of new champ select and dynamic queue to ranked, as players get the roles they want (with some exceptions we&rsquo;ll talk about below), we&rsquo;ve seen the frequency at which ranked players encounter language serious enough to result in a chat restriction has dropped by nearly 40%.\r\n\r\nOverall, we interpret these numbers to suggest a higher (and more positive) degree of engagement with dynamic queue, but we still have a lot of work to do on a number of fronts.\r\n\r\nAt the launch of new champion select, dodge rates almost doubled from the old queue because of the new lock-in requirement. We&rsquo;ve added new sounds and made a few other usability improvements to help correct this. We&rsquo;re also still pursuing a tricky bug that makes the client not pop to front when it&rsquo;s your turn as well. The dodge rate is now slightly lower than the previous champ select (even when we include players who dodge by failing to lock in), but there&rsquo;s still room for improvement. \r\n\r\nThere are some remaining critical issues with matchmaking. High-skill players above Diamond tier have seen unacceptable queue times lasting as long as an hour. We launched a high-MMR queue time update on March 4. As a result, average queue times for most high MMR players are down to 5 minutes, but some at the highest levels still have much longer waits. That&rsquo;s still not good enough and fixing it is one of our highest priorities. \r\n\r\nWhen we first launched new champion select, players were getting their primary role about 70% of the time. As selection behavior changed, this number dropped. We expected players would try and game the system, but we may have underestimated the impact on matchmaking, and there are some particularly bad position combos that result in getting secondary position too frequently. Improving and properly calibrating role selection is also high priority for us.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve also been working to fix a lot of critical issues while adding some much needed functionality, such as being able to open your champion grid at any time and not revealing pick intent to opponents when it&rsquo;s your turn. \r\n\r\nA few days after we launched dynamic queue we said we would re-release solo queue within weeks, which we haven&rsquo;t. The main reason is we&#039;ve prioritized improving matchmaking and position select first and foremost. It&#039;s also clear we underestimated the amount of iterative work necessary to bring dynamic queue up to our standards, and we should have communicated that earlier. That said, as we continue our work, we&#039;re concerned about the impact solo queue will have on matchmaking as a whole, and we&rsquo;re assessing how to best proceed. Once we&#039;ve fixed match times and position selection, we&rsquo;ll have a better update on other queues.\r\n\r\nUntil then, thanks for helping make the new queue and the new season start off so successfully! GLHF, and we&rsquo;ll see you on the Rift.\r\n\r\nRiot Socrates","replies":[{"poster":"PsycloneJoker","date":"2016-03-22T18:12:45.164+0000","up_votes":406,"down_votes":25,"body":"> That said, as we continue our work, we're concerned about the impact solo queue will have on matchmaking as a whole, and we’re assessing how to best proceed.\n\nLooks like you guys are getting an early start on backtracking about solo queue.

We're not trying to be dishonest or dodge this topic. Radio silence on this the past couple months has been painful, we know. We hoped to come out with a direct answer to this, but working through the problems players are facing on live now (consistency around position select, queue times and matchmaking for high MMR) is taking longer than we initially expected. We did a bad job at managing expectations around this and deserve the heat we're getting around that.\n\nThat being said, solo queue does not directly address either of these problems and could suffer from the exact same problems.

I'm sorry if this seems a bit ranty but I've had this on my chest for a while now and I need to get it off. I've been playing LoL for about 3 years now, I started playing the game at a time when I was deeply depressed and it really helped me recover.\n\n I have invested a lot of time, effort, and emotion into this game, and I will continue to do so because I honestly believe that Riot is a really great game dev in at a level that is severely lacking even decent ones. I want to continue to play this game because I enjoy it despite everything I have to deal with on a daily basis, both inside and outside the game. League enriches my life and I've never found anything that's comparable to it, there's no other online game that's as well designed, no other online game that's as well loved by both it's players and it's developers, the only reason I'm writing this is because I KNOW you folks care about making a good game and ARE listening.\n\nDynamic Queue has been a _THOROUGHLY_  miserable experience, in my 3 years of playing I've never had as less fun as I am having right now. Every game is so much more mentally exhausting than before, every game feels so much less in my control. Please understand, I firmly believe that you can win most games by playing well, and I still do, just far less than I did before. \n\nIt feels like you have so much less impact and so much less agency than you did before. What it feels to me is that 70% of your games are decided by what I've come to call 'power groups' a premade on your team or the other team that just crushes everyone else. I don't like playing in premades outside of normals, and I intend to never play in a ranked premade ever, I wish to play **alone** because I believe that that experience, one that I have not had the chance to get ONCE since this season started is truly unique and is the best way to experience the game.\n\nYou are making a huge mistake by going down this path, every time you've spoken about this subject you've been trying to convince yourself and the community that this is a good idea, I think that alone is grounds for reconsidering your stance. I promise you that once and if Solo Q is ever released me and what I believe to be a significant portion of the playerbase will not touch Dynamic with a 10-meter pole, we want nothing to do with it because it is such a despicable experience. I say this on a personal level that Dynamic Q is one of the few times in my life where i experience unequivocal and unilateral hate and loathing towards something, I've never felt like this before and I truly wish that I didn't feel this way but I want to continue playing this game and Dynamic Q is an **Obstacle** to me doing so, I play in this queue because it's the only one available, because I have no choice, I would playing fucking 3v3 if it had a true solo q, I would play a competitive solo Q mode where the only champion available was Soraka if it meant that I could play Solo Q.\n\nPlease, I beg you, I truly beg you to bring up Solo Q faster and focus on it, nothing good can or will ever come out of Dynamic Q, please please PLEASE don't let this be what kills the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BRBGTGBOWFLEX","date":"2016-03-23T09:18:25.447+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":3,"body":"Socrates, I do not envy the position you are in, however, I wanted to speak a bit on how I perceive this whole ordeal.\n\n**Dynamic Queue is already a dishonest endeavor.**\n\n It has been since inception. From the time it was announced it was very clear that the project goals were not to improve the quality of games, the accuracy of matchmaking, or the competitiveness of ranked play. It is something that was pushed for business reasons alone (improved player retention via community tie-in, increased social purchasing revenue) and every post from Riot discussing it makes it very clear that you are struggling to keep a straight face. However, lies of omission are really not much better than outright lies and it feels like there is a bit of both going on.\n\n**Outright Lies**\n\nI will speak plainly: most of the community believed that you were dishonest from day one. That the plan was to announce Dynamic Queue, make a false promise about Solo Queue (to quell the initial outrage), and try to stall until Dynamic Queue became the norm. That is what much of the community feared. Riot's actions match up to the explanation that Riot is dishonest rather than the explanation that \"unforeseen things happened\" or \"lol we learned queues r 2 hard\". \n\nIf you intended to make Solo Queue a reality, you would need to have a team working on it, for quite awhile, including awhile before Dynamic Queue launched. You would have encountered all these problems earlier. Tell us, Socrates, what happened to the team working on Solo Queue? Just when were they pulled? How many labor hours were actually spent on this? If Riot actually spent considerable resources on a Solo Queue, you would not be able to say things like \"we're concerned about the impact solo queue will have on matchmaking as a whole, and we’re assessing how to best proceed\" because it already would have been a business priority. \n\nLike what, are we supposed to believe that you treated this initiative seriously? Or that if you had wanted it done that it wouldn't be ready and launched? Do you think we sincerely believe that features \"accidentally\" do not make it? It is not an accident.\n\nThis is theater and a farce. Riot never had the intention of implementing Solo Queue.  It is not a mistake or a miscalculation. It is a lie. It is dishonest.\n\n**Lies of Omission**\n\nThe numbers you do not say speak much louder than the numbers you do. You say meaningless things like \"the number of people playing in premades is the highest we’ve seen in League’s history\" as if it was a positive metric. It is not a positive metric. It is an admission that the system handicaps solo players and achieves what you intended-- forcing people into group play. The attempt to present this as a positive statistic is dishonest. Premades are not some inherent good, in fact, I think that outside of a full team, they have no place in ranked play (this includes duo queues). But, premades have risen, because solo players cannot afford to queue solo if they want to be competitive.\n\n\"Match quality has improved slightly\"? Really? You're going to argue MMR benefit? I am absolutely positive that there are many documents at Riot which you have read where it is clear that MMR differentials and match quality in Dynamic Queue would NEVER equal what could be achieved with independent queues of 1,1,1,1,1 vs 1,1,1,1,1. You have to be aware that the match quality has already been sacrificed and that group queues lower match quality. So why try to present this stat? It makes no sense.\n\n\"We’ve seen the frequency at which ranked players encounter language serious enough to result in a chat restriction has dropped by nearly 40%.\" Wow. If Toxicity had actually been lowered, you would have said that pretty plainly. However, it has not lowered and you also cite a specific punishment (chat restriction) rather than all punishments, further making this statistic meaningless. It's easy to see why you pick this one-- because now a lot of chat with premades, even with randoms, moves to voice chat, so less is typed to warrant a chat restriction. Griefing and toxicity are worse because **GROUPS ARE TOXIC**. They inherently create divisions. Riot has tried to sugar coat this one, to pretend it's a perception problem, etc-- but we're pretty well aware that groups are not good for those not in them and lower the play experience. You have also admitted that 4 queues are extremely toxic, but have withheld numbers.\n\nThere are all kinds of other weasel statistics we are given. But other than the dodge stat, you're with-holding information to try to create a false impression that Dynamic Queue is a good thing for the player base, when it has not been and will not be. \n\nUnfortunately, your ability to withhold numbers makes it difficult for the player base to see just how Dynamic Queue is harming the game.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI am pretty sure that other than massive PR backlash, Solo Queue will not be implemented. It is not something we can trust Riot to naturally do-- it will only be done in response to backlash (I am positive that Riot's plans are basically \"Dynamic Queue only unless it provokes outrage\". A necessary condition for Solo Queue is outrage or a decrease in profitability attributed to lack of a Solo Queue.\n\nOn this front, I think you'll find that solo queue players will leave and this will impact your revenue. We will see if that matters, but there's just no point to playing League for me without a Solo Queue option and I don't feel I am alone on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyraknoss","date":"2016-03-22T18:16:17.912+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you're worried about how soloqueue will effect match making it stands to reason fixing match making before you release solo queue is a pointless endeavor.

Wouldn't it be better to do it once in light of the data of SoloQ impacting DynamicQ rather than improve DQ, then release SQ, and then again go back to fixing DQ. \n\nThe current approach seems to not care about/downplays SoloQ's impact on DynamicQ which is odd.

As selection behavior changed, this number dropped. We expected players would try and game the system, but we may have underestimated the impact on matchmaking, and there are some particularly bad position combos that result in getting secondary position too frequently. Improving and properly calibrating role selection is also high priority for us.\n\nThis is really barebones information on a topic that players are very interested in. How popular are the individual roles in champ select and how does that popularity affect queue times? How often does \"fill\" end up each individual role? Does primary vs. secondary role actually do anything? I understand that if you select Mid/Support you will still get Support more than half the time because of the popularity disparity, but how much of a difference does it make compared to how often Support/Mid would receive Mid?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FFF1","date":"2016-03-22T23:10:05.823+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> That said, as we continue our work, we're concerned about the impact solo queue will have on matchmaking as a whole, and we’re assessing how to best proceed.\n\nNO SOLOQ? \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sPwMIz5.jpg","replies":[]}]}
