Either way, \"to\" and \"too\" are different words that mean different things.\n\nLook, first of all, *none* of the 3-hit mechanics are ridiculously powerful. The only one to receive recent nerfs was Ekko's passive, and Ekko as a whole champion is overtuned so that was expected in the first place. They're strong, but balanced, and more pronounced, because they happen about 1/3 as frequently as other effects.\n\nSecond, making something happen on every attack is not power *gating.* Power *gating* is making the player work for their power. It holds them back if they don't have the right setup. Letting it happen on every attack and just scaling it back until it's worthless is what happened to Gangplank's passive. I'm not saying he needs a 3-hit passive, but the fact remains that his passive is the second-worst part of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"DanofDemacia","date":"2015-06-23T23:05:24.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"You have no argument shutup already","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-06-24T00:03:52.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your argument is to tell me to shut up, *you* are the one lacking an argument.\n\nCounter something I have said.
