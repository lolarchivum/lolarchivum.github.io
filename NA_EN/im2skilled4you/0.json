Did it start happening only shortly after the patch? Does it work completely normal for a minute or two then start \"attempting to reconnect\" even when it says your ping and fps are fine? Sliding across the screen and then at 500 ping and disconnect? Does it work completely normal everywhere else on the game and only sometimes mess up during load screen then disconnect once in game?\n\nSo if your internet is fine and everything else is normal. Then here is your solution. Go and delete the lol_launcher folder. C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects Should be 6 folders in there. Delete only the \"lol_launcher\" folder. Have the game client closed before. Then reopen the game and it should repatch with a brand new folder in like 2-5 seconds. I went in a custom after doing that and no more retarded sliding across the map and attempting to reconnect or disconnect. Finally freaking fixed. If the solution happens to not work for you, then I'm guessing your problem might be a bit different than mine.","replies":[{"poster":"Nagirte","date":"2014-09-17T21:46:23.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you sure?

It was working fine one day, then started messing up all night. Then it coincidentally acted fine during my Co-Op for my win of the day after I woke up. Then later when I went in a regular match, the problem returned. So then I closed all applications, made sure everything was up to date, restarted my computer, then deleted that folder and open the client. Repatched folder as brand new and problem was gone. If you do this solution and it doesn't fix it for you, then yours might be something different than mine.\n\nAlthough I will point out on thing I noticed before fixing it. PBE server works perfectly. Great ping and fps, so why do I DC only on the live server? So I thought it might be a corrupted file for the live game. I came across that deleting that folder might help and it worked for me. So I thought I'd see if it would help anyone else having a similar problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"manythingserased","date":"2014-09-17T21:24:43.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dead game","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrCyRAX","date":"2014-09-17T19:23:13.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem, then i check the activity monitor to see the applications running, and after i get disconected i always get a LOL patcher non reponding, i quit it and the game resumes...
