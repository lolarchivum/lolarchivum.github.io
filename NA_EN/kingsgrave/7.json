Just decided it wasn't the best fit in the end.\n\nIt's his only CC though. Why can't it be stronger than a stun?\n\nTahm Kench has a stun, a slow, a SUPPRESS on a BASIC ABILITY and he can make an ally untargetable and (mostly) invulnerable for about the same time as Taric, on a much shorter cooldown.\n\nTahm Kench is the most comparable to Taric because they are both pretty much entirely immobile (though Tahm does have Taric beat there as well). \n\nAdditionally, Bastion is a cute ability, but every other tank support has the same thing with Bond of Stone. And yes, Taric can have both, but Taric is going to be balanced entirely around having both, so Bastion will never be that strong when combined with Bond of Stone and will generally be lackluster when Taric takes Windspeaker's instead because its numbers are tuned around being combined with Bond of Stone.\n\nI see absolutely no argument that \"A charm is stronger than a stun\" is valid, especially considering that CC has a 1 second delay, which is insane. I know you said Taric's reliability profile was too much because of a point and click stun, but you made it a skill shot, you didn't increase the range, and you gave it a delay, in exchange for it being able to hit multiple targets (so a less effective, lower damage Bard Q. Joy). You also dropped the duration at early ranks, forcing him to max it first. \n\nDazzle has been nerfed to the point that it is not nearly the gem it once was, and you removed all the other sources of damage from his kit except his passive, which requires him to hit his stun to use.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm angry, it's because I am, but I think all of these points are valid and I would appreciate it, Repetoir, if you didn't just skim over this comment and ignore it. Please, reply and tell me why after repeatedly nerfing this stun and giving him no other CC or mobility, you felt that \"charms being stronger\" wasn't a reason to give it to him? Bastion is a much weaker ability than Devour in terms of protecting your ally in lane, and Devour/Black Shield is generally better at protecting your allies from picks than Taric's new Radiance (I can't remember the full name). \n\nArguing that Taric is better in team fights than either Tahm Kench or Morgana is fine, but that's because all three champions are immobile. In team fights, Leona Braum and Alistar ALL will be more effective than Taric. Hell, even Poppy or Sion will be able to peel better.\n\nI don't want another generalist. Generalists are balanced entirely around numbers. They are either strong numerically, in which case they crowd out others, or they are weak, and then they never see play. Taric has a niche. His niche is defending his allies. You gave him subpar peeling and subpar pick protection.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-04-07T17:27:46.834+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Taric has a niche.

You gave him subpar peeling and subpar pick protection.\n\nAs a sort of paladin archtype, I wanted to make Taric focused on defending his allies in less of a strict \"I peel for you\" way (like how most tanks express their ability to defend) and more in an \"I empower you\" way, which is why his defending is focused more on shield, healing, etc.\n\nI agree that Taric does have subpar peeling and pick protection next to many other tanks/supports. That said, his ability to defend a team in a teamfight scenario is pretty unparalleled, which is a tradeoff I believe is appropriate.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2016-04-08T21:36:35.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
