He might even start blade of the ruined king.\n\nIf he starts Doran's Blade, he's only making things easier for Gnar. Same goes for BotRK, Trundle is just gonna die randomly from the poke damage, so he either builds armor and try to survive the laning phase or build damage and die over and over.","replies":[{"poster":"billxx","date":"2016-06-09T18:59:00.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well idk then.

You can gut his sustain by sustaining yourself and his ad steal will be vastly overpowered by your passive\n\nAnd blocking your escape with pillar is meh, you are very immobile anyway so if you are really over extending your would have been fucked regardless vision will help here so spam pinks\n\nYou can then proceed to build armor items like these \n{{item:3075}} because his damage is pretty much basic attacks will help nullify lifesteal if he builds it.\n{{item:3047}} Block a % of basic atatck damage his ult wont stop that\n{{item:3143}} attackspeed slow and active slow overall good because again his ult wont stop the attackspeed slow\n{{item:3110}} also slows attackspeed will also be a good item\n\nall good items vs trundle","replies":[]},{"poster":"INoble KnightI","date":"2016-06-08T04:09:13.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd rather face Trundle than {{champion:150}} and {{champion:114}} anyday","replies":[{"poster":"Rìveń","date":"2016-06-08T09:48:35.832+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd understand if you'd rather fight him than Gnar's obnoxious poke, kiting and extreme CC, but Fiora? Really? Tank Fiora was nerfed, she now has to build alot of damage meaning that she easily dies, she doesn't have a good way to quickly and unpredictably engage a teamfight and dies instantly if she doesn't parry all of your shit with one W, and if your whole team threw all of your spells at a Fiora at the same time, I'm sorry, but you deserved to lose that fight. In the early game her W also has a rather long cooldown and is quite easy to play around if you have even a single dash/blink ability and unless you're in really high ELO it's rather easy to bait it out. She is generally considered a skill-matchup vs damage dealers these days and a counter to tanks.\n\nMeanwhile Trundle is literally impossible to trade against if you're a melee toplaner in the early game because of his Q decreasing your AD whilst increasing his own by twice the amount, I've had games where he's rushed sunfire and still has more AD than me when I'm building damage because I lose 20 AD and he gains 40 whenever he uses his level 5 Q on me. Ontop of that, the cooldown on the ability is only 4 seconds at all ranks and lasts for 8 seconds and costs only 30 mana, meaning that he can easily have himself buffed and you debuffed at all times. He also gets free literal shit tons of sustain straight out of his arse from his passive which instantly heals him for 2/3/4/5/6% of his max health whenever a unit _**dies, no effort required**_ within a 1400 units range (to give you a perspective of approximately how far this is, Twisted Fate's Q range is 1450). This is just an absurd amount of sustain. His ultimate is also extremely problematic, because it punishes your team for even having a tank, which is just completely retarded.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DontBanMeImDrunk","date":"2016-06-08T14:15:09.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"hes literally no different than any other tanky top laner.","replies":[]}]}
