It's Matthew.  I'm a 22 year old that's currently a student at a local community college.  Being as I'm seeking a 3D animation degree, I'll be planning to transfer to a state university eventually.  You'd never guess I'm 22 just by looking at me, which is interesting.\n\nI use to be a competitive swimmer.  However, because of a pelvic injury when I was much younger, I was unable to get very far in that line of life.  Which is sad, as I greatly enjoyed swimming.\n\nStarted playing League way back when Maokai was, literally, the newest champion around (or early 2011, for those that don't know).  Started out playing with Ezreal.  Because of a mentality of \" Gotta play relatable characters\".  After Ezreal, no other champion really shocked interests in me.  At least, till Riven was released.  Built a rune page and all for her... then Fiora was released.  Favored Fiora so greatly, that I can still say that I main Fiora even after the rework.\n\nNow, with that out of the way.  I started playing video games with the very first game in the Moto Racer series.  It was great.  But I didn't really find much interest in video games beyond that, until I was able to play the demo version of Age of Empires on some disc (don't recall what it was).  Loved the demo so much, that I just had to have the first Age of Empires game.  So, one of my sisters bought it as a gift on my 10th birthday.  Loved it, but still wasn't that engrossed with video games... until I was able to play a certain FPS that went by the name \"Halo: Combat Evolved\".  That's when I started to actually love video games.\nSadly, I wasn't ever able to play the second Halo, and when I was unable to play the first halo, my love started to fade.  At least, till I got my hands on Age of Empires 2.  That game is by far my favorite game of all time (Yes, I'm aware that's an HD edition.  Bought it on day one).\n\nNow, lastly.  How'd I get into League.  Watched a Youtuber (SSoHPKC) play a bit of it, eventually got interested in trying it out.  It stuck.  That's about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-12-04T06:51:08.301+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My name is Rubu Yingdis.

Sounds contradictory, right? Well, you often work 60 hours a week, but it's very rewarding and fulfilling. Your boss will constantly take you to task and isn't afraid to chew you out, but they will always make sacrifices to help you. You will be introduced to the best people in the world, only to have them taken away from you 6-18 months later. You will never have as high of expectations set on you anywhere else, but you will rarely face those expectations alone.\nFinally, I will leave you with three things I wish I had known/done before I joined.\n\n1. Work some different job before joining so that you have a realistic perspective of the world outside the military. You forget what it's like to be a civilian after a few years of being on the other side.\n\n2. If you look at your contract, and it doesn't say EXACTLY what job you are going to have, then it doesn't matter what your recruiter told you, you have no way of knowing what job you will get. In general, don't let your recruiter rush you into any decisions.\n\n3. If you haven't heard the term, \"It's a one mistake Air Force,\" you will soon. What this means is that for the next 6-12 years (which is approximately 1-2 terms of enlistment), the Air Force is trying very hard to cut people. That means if you make one mistake, it often leads to you getting kicked out. Fail a Physical Training test? Create an image of yourself that your boss thinks is unprofessional? Get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time? Get rated \"average\" or \"below average\" on your job performance? I've seen outstanding Airmen get kicked out for all of these things (and basically, the third one is what happened to me). It gets even easier to cut you if you become a commissioned officer, since the only reason required to kick you out is a \"lack of confidence in your ability to lead.\" I'm not trying to scare you, I'm just trying to teach you the only way I've found to combat this. You have to find someone in your chain of command willing to stake their career on you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Toa of Death","date":"2015-12-04T03:03:11.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name's Paul.
