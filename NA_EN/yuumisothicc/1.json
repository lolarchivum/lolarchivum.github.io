And I don't mean that in a demeaning way: if I am getting bent in lane, it's not always as simple as thinking \"damn, I'm getting bent...what can I do from here?\" Most times, that horrible early game is accompanied by tilt, and more often than not, at least one teammate running their mouth and rubbing my nose in the mess I am *WELL FUCKING AWARE OF* at every possible moment. More often it's the tilt, and not the person themselves, that dictates the response you're talking about.\n\nSo, naturally, the first thing to do about it is *realize* you're tilted, and try to fix that. You can't think when you're mad - your brain literally turns like 2/3 of itself off. Mute the cretin flaming you in chat, try and find a different place to go than the place you've been dying, and slowly bring yourself back into the game - as in, bring *your head* back to *actively thinking* about the game, don't fight-or-flight your way into a bigger mess. I will say though that in most cases (remember, you can't think when you're tilted) you may need some outside encouragement to calm your shit.\n\nI'm horrible about it, personally. If I'm 0/5 in lane, and tilted, I will hit that ff button, and I will be the guy everyone gets annoyed by and makes fun of. I'm not a saint. And at that point in the game, I'm likely not *thinking properly*. What people need to do when a person like me, 0/5, tilted, but still trying to play the game, is having it rough is to be as passive about saying \"play it out\" as possible. There is no harsher judge than oneself when one isn't doing well. Trust me: I'm aware that I'm 0/5, and causing issues. No need for the aggressive \"fck off 0/5, we'll carry you\" stuff. No need for the dismissive \"just sit under tower and stop feeding, we'll be ok\" stuff. It's as simple as your tone: just \"We got this. Play it out\" solves about 80% of the issue. It's not hostile, it's encouraging without being over-promising, and it's a vote of confidence that the game is still winnable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1337azn","date":"2019-07-27T16:51:35.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is a team game.
