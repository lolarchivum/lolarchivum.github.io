Well when nobody on your team wants to dodge this solves the problem. Its treated like /ff. in the champ select you type /dg in the chat bot and it pulls up a box saying &quot;Name&quot; Has started a dodge vote. Would you like to Dodge? Yes/No. The people who say yes will not lose LP or have a time limit their first time. More so after the first two in a day they start losing the standard amount. &gt; 3 lp and 6 mins. Dodging the old fashion way would still be something for people who get denied the dodge vote. The punishments will still apply for this. Im honestly tired of dodging sometimes when i get a troll and losing 6 mins of my play time that i could be playing a game with. So riot please take a look at this and give your thoughts. I honestly think it will be a good addition to the Community","replies":[{"poster":"Ryzing2Diamond","date":"2015-11-28T16:09:33.625+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":">Player locks in non-meta pick\n>/dg\n>All 4 vote yes.\nThis won't work.

Most people won't know which team is better at low ELO and it largely depends in skill level and counter pick isn't a thing.  as for high ELO most have a nice skill lvl and they would counterpick nicely and \"enemy having a \"better\" team\" wouldn't be a case\n\nEdit: Are you South Asian or of South Asian ansectary by any chance?
