But now that convenience is downgraded this patch, you are at the top of scoreboard regardless. The problem with this is it takes a bit longer to compare scores. For example if I&#039;m adc and I want to see my score relative to enemy adc score, I now have to look top, then bottom, which creates delay in a game where every millisecond counts. Such a weird and unnecessary change. Perhaps just a bug?\n\n\n\nSURE I do have option to move my position, but if I&#039;m adc for example, I have to do a lot of shuffling to line my position up with enemy bot laners. (adc and support next to each other). It was really convenient before.
