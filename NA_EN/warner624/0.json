I was asking myself &quot;who would fit the Cosmic Reaver theme,&quot; and truthfully, not a lot of champions stood out. Talon, Katarina, Irelia maybe. Then I came across Sion, and I realized how neat this kind of skin would look on him (not to mention he&#039;s in sore need of a new skin)!\n\nLet&#039;s break down why this would be cool:\n\n* **Sion desperately needs a new skin.**\n* Cosmic Reaver could use a new skin, and it&#039;s a line that I could see expanded upon in marvelous ways.\n* Q: Sion winds up a soul-shattering blow, rimmed with a gold indicator. As Sion charges his Q, **stars collect in the AoE, ending with a cataclysmic flash of light upon impact.**\n* W: Sion activates his Soul Furnace, **pouring forth stars and nebulae,** shielding him from incoming damage.\n* E: Sion&#039;s shouts alone can propel minions and slow enemy champions,** shrouding them in a haze of cosmic energies.**\n* R: Calling upon the might of the cosmos, **Sion turns into a roaring comet**, hurtling down the lane (did you watch the Aurelion Sol trailer? Imagine that passing comet is Sion).\n* Instead of Jarvan I&#039;s crown, Sion dons a golden mask, emphasizing his mouth/jaw. A ceremonial dagger older than time itself adorns Sion&#039;s head, piercing his cloak.\n* Sion&#039;s crippled leg has been restored-- almost. Cosmic energies gleam and swirl, as the Undead Juggernaut restores himself with incomprehensible power.\n* **Golden axe, bro. It&#039;s golden. It&#039;s an axe. 200% better than a regular axe. Plus this one&#039;s, like, been through space and time and stuff.**\n* I highly recommend imagining Sion ulting down mid into a 1v5 while Elton John's Rocket Man plays.\n\n**Anyways, this post isn&#039;t just about sharing my idea for Cosmic Reaver Sion. Y&#039;all should chime in with any ideas you have personally for Cosmic Reaver skins! Thanks for reading.**\n\n**EDIT: Remember to upvote if you like it, maybe we can convince the good folks at Riot to consider this skin! :-)**\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-08T00:08:10.598+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"The particles would be amazing. \\*-*","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-03-08T00:24:40.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"SHOW THIS TO THE SKIN GUYS!\n\nIf you can...please.","replies":[{"poster":"Warner624","date":"2016-03-08T01:15:20.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pr3ERjBE,comment-id=00150000,timestamp=2016-03-08T00:24:40.757+0000)\n>\n> SHOW THIS TO THE SKIN GUYS!\n> \n> If you can...please.\n\nI agree.
