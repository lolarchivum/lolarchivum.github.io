You should make your own keybindings and put it wherever you find it is most optimally placed for you. My summoner spells are 1 and 2, my ultimate is 3, my other 3 skills are Q,W,E and item actives are A,S,D, 4 is ward - I also use the ~ key for stop. But I always place my most defensive summoner spell on 1 and my less defensive summoner spell on 2 because I have become accustomed to hitting 1 in situations that call for popping of defensive abilities like flash - and by doing it that way I never accidentally hit flash when I mean to hit something else, or get confused when I use different summoner spells. If i did use the standard bindings I would probably put it on D. I would definitely suggest you get accustomed to always placing certain summoner spells on certain keys so that you don't confuse yourself and use the wrong one.
