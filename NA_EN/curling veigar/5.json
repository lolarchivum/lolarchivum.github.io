That's what they were going for.\n\nSo your logic is the mid laner needs to be a roamer to win the match... then why pick Veigar? There are plenty of mid lane picks who are better at roaming, mainly due to their mobility which includes jumping over walls (Zed, Katarina, LeBlanc, etc.). \n\nWhile Riot continues to cater to the mobility creep in order to keep the LCS exciting to watch, old fashioned mages like Veigar are just out of place now. Also because of how much he excels at stopping mobility with his stun (like Kalista's hopping) and him lacking much of a \"play-making\" kit, Riot doesn't want that to continue so they are slowly taking him out of the picture through nerfs. Remember that he was picked a couple times as a support (plus one time mid) and would likely be a replacement for Annie (FIRE AND GIANT TEDDY BEAR OHMAHGAWD!) if Riot didn't intervene.\nWhy do you think Nasus got nerfed after he was picked a few times in the LCS? He makes top lane a bore fest. He's not jumping around the map or consistently making flashy effects happen. All he does is Q minions. That's not exciting LCS material, so they made sure the pros won't want to pick him anymore. The same thing is happening with Veigar and will happen with more \"boring\" champions. As soon as Malzahar gets picked in the LCS, he'll receive a beating from the nerf bat too, along with Brand, Garen, Gangplank, and so on.\n\nThe LCS is all that matters now, and if a champion isn't \"LCS viable\" and tries to get into the spotlight, there is little to no hesitation in swinging the nerf bat at them. \nCase in point: Zed, Lee Sin and Thresh. Look at how they \"balance\" them. Then look at Veigar, Nasus and Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-03-01T22:45:59.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thresh hasn't got a buff in a long time; if i'm not mistaken the last 3 patches to him or so where nerfs.

So you statements is half true. Then other immobile champions are gotten buffs (Annie to be precise) and besides a flash+tibbers she has no real flashy moves. \n\nThresh was broken on release and is still broken to this day. The fact that literally every ability in his kit makes exciting plays happen keeps him safe from proper balancing. Compare him to Sona and Janna's balance histories.\n\nThe nerfs Thresh gets? \n\n-Lost 25 range on his basic attacks. \n*WHOOPTY-DO!* Thresh can be **melee** and still be a top tier support. His attack range is irrelevant to the utility he brings.\n\n-Lantern shields only himself and one ally. \nThat's fine for ARAM, but bot lane on SR consists of 2 people. Therefore, the nerf has no meaningful effect and still retains the main reason for using the lantern.\n\nThresh will never be balanced as long as he remains a major play-maker to make those exciting LCS plays happen. I guarantee you he would be gutted if there was no LCS. \n\nThis same principle applies to Zed. No one argued his attack speed was the reason he's too strong, but that's where Riot focused on him just so a nerf could be applied and give us the illusion that they care about what we think, all the while keeping him attractive to the pros so he still gets picked in the LCS. They want us to see the nerf and go \"Yay! Finally a nerf! Riot does care!\" In reality, we're not that naïve. \n\nNow we've come to Veigar, the yordle who excels at putting mobility creep to a halt. Especially when you consider Veigar can stop Kalista from hopping around by just having the cage surrounding her, Riot didn't want a champion who can effortlessly prevent #LC$bigplays, hence the delay on the stun. Veigar has had that stun since he was released, but Kalista whined to Riot about it so they suddenly jumped on the change.\n\nAnnie is full of fiery effects, not just from Tibbers. The ability to control a giant teddy bear is intriguing to people watching, especially those who may consider giving the game a try (the target audience). She received buffs because Janna was beginning to make a return, but of course just buffing an \"LCS viable\" champion sometimes isn't enough. Why else do you think Janna quickly got nerfed once again, harshly at that?","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-03-02T01:07:24.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"May I remind you annie buff were mid based?

Are you saying a faster and tankier Tibbers doesn't make support Annie better? If anything, the nerf to her E (on herself) hurts mid Annie more than support.\nThe purpose of Tibbers is to stun an enemy team (with burst damage) at range, apply additional damage over time, and tank objectives. It doesn't matter whether Annie is playing support or mid, aside from damage output. If Tibbers can do those 3 things, he's doing his job.\n\nVeigar didn't see much LCS play because his stun is his only selling point at that elo range and it isn't a guaranteed stun to begin with. His stun isn't targeted like Annie's Q and can't easily stun a team like Tibbers or even Annie's W, nor does he have a pet to tank objectives with. A competent team that works together can handle Veigar and will get MR to counter his burst.\n\nJanna doesn't have a lot of flashiness in her kit. She has the tornado and her high cooldown ult that can *sometimes* make plays if used at the right moment. That's it. Her W doesn't look much different from her basic attack and her shield is rather plain.\nAnnie, on the other hand, emits pretty fiery effects on all of her abilities and controls a giant, flaming teddy bear. Additionally, being a little girl shows greater diversity in the League roster. It's certainly more welcoming to see than yet another half-naked woman who talks like a slut.\nAll of Thresh's abilities are easy to see and understand from an inexperienced person's perspective (and look presentable on top of it), plus as already stated, every single one of them makes plays happen, not just one normal ability and an ult only if used correctly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2015-03-01T22:54:35.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RogueWill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=olh9V4nU,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-01T22:45:59.630+0000)\n>\n> Thresh hasn't got a buff in a long time; if i'm not mistaken the last 3 patches to him or so where nerfs.

Old Veigar would never be able to last hit every single minion in a wave, especially early, simply because of the cooldown and mana cost (it isn't Nasus Q. Heck, it's very difficult if not impossible for Nasus last hit every single minion with Q because of the early cooldown and the fact that your minions will kill their minions). It isn't that there are more minions for him to farm with Q, it's just that he is more able to efficiently farm the existing minions with his Q.\n\nThis is also the given justification for the nerf on his ultimate ratio, because according to some of the internal tests they ran, since it was easier for Veigar to stack AP, his ult would be doing even more damage than before even with the reduced ratio because of the extra AP gained; whether this is *actually* the case in the live game and *actually* justified is still debatable, since he *did* lose DFG. At the same time, DFG's removal *was* intended to make mages less bursty, so I think it's a mistake to think that compensatory buffs to any champion will give them back the burst they had with DFG.\n\nI don't think I need to give my opinion on his current state since the current statistics seem to speak for themselves.
