You say 'you literly attack all 4 other memebers of your team that's posted on here' yeah pretty obvious it were the 3 that gave me the punishment? Also you say they're having a bad time. One of the games was a game was a game I was carrying but my team or at least my jgl and mid lane were feeding hard and were blaming me for it I wasn't flaming untill then because I thought we would win but they started annoying me cause they were the one making mistakes and they were flaming me for their own mistakes. I don't blame my teammates for my mistakes. But if you have a Camille support that doesn't even come to lane with you against an actual good support who PEELS adc it makes a huge difference. What can I do say it's my fault that I got dived because we got no vision or I get no peel from the support. Counterganks don't exist and they don't like to teamplay. I don't deny that I make a lot of misstakes but I try to play as a team as much as possible. I never denied that I wasn't toxic either but I don't deserve to get restricted from chat for 3 bad games while another 100 were helpful and friendly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"èGirl Nami","date":"2017-07-06T12:40:29.090+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> CrimsonPvP: well you can't report me for anything at all\n\nYou lied to them!
