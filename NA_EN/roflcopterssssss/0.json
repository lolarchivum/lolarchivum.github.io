A person with that fast reflexes will be able to see, comprehend, and react to something coming at him/her at 900 miles per hour. That is beyond human capabilities.\n\nEven a Rengar who is not fed can delete an ADC in less than .3 seconds. With all his MS buffs late game and the fact that he can use his abilities before or during his jump, unless he is spotted with a pink ward first, there is literally nothing anyone can do to stop him besides using scripts.\n\nRengar's combo essentially has no counter play outside of spotting him with a pink ward. He is too fast to react against, and even if someone manages to act in time, most CCs have animation time. By the time the CC actually lands, the ADC would be dead regardless.\n\nOne can argue that other assassins such as Talon or LeBlanc is capable of doing the same thing. However, the key difference between them and Rengar is that Talon or LeBlanc needs to get there first and then kill you. Rengar does it on the way.\n\nWhen Talon jumps on a target even if from his ultimate, a fast-fingered Leona might be able to stun him before Talon lands his Q. Likewise, a good Sona will be able to CC LB mid dash and the damage will not land.\nBut with Rengar, even if you do somehow stop him mid air, the ADC is probably already dead.\n\nRengar is either going to be overpowered or underpowered.

Timing your abilities so they all hit at the same time still takes time. You can't just say \"oh they hit at the same time so that's all it took\"\nThat's like saying syndra 7 ball ulted me and i died in .1 second.

He barely does anything until he snowballs \n\nYou dont even understand my post ... \nThe whole 0,01 thread is just circlejerk pointless hate rengar For free glory thready.. \n\nYes once in a while rengar dmg ll acidently line up and he ll kill you so fast... But he doesnt fly from the point he jumps from to you in 0,01 sec","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2015-12-31T15:15:33.855+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://cdn.niketalk.com/5/58/900x900px-LL-58cf3418_salt_intensifies.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2016-01-01T00:10:25.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just pink ward the spear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeemoXNidalee","date":"2015-12-31T00:58:15.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The damage is only dealt when he hits you, just use your skills when he reveals himself (jump start).
