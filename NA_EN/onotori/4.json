Most video game industries have to change stuff like that otherwise their monthly income actually goes down. your logic is backward. Riot needs to keep the people happy in order to make money.

My credentials for knowing this is just general business stuff which is what im going to college for. I'm just so tired of people thinking riot just lets champs go crazy for months. They probably nerf slow because they don't want to overreact and people say it takes too long but then if they \"olaf\" a champ people on the boards freak out saying they went way out of line. Such is the life of the boards where it is such a small percentage of the community that thinks that riot balances the entire game around the boards and reddit... my personal thoughts as an adc main is that kaisa is annoying but there are some matchups that kaisa just hates like ezreal and caitlyn but from my experience any engage support or support with cc against kaisa is super good against her and if kaisa doesn't have a support with reliable cc in lane she is really hard to play then because shes a good kill lane with the likes of leona and alistar and thresh.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"341123545652","date":"2018-04-16T02:12:30.226+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwinkiePro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4nAyMhq1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-16T01:59:36.290+0000)\n>\n> http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html\n> \n> Current changes to the PBE.
