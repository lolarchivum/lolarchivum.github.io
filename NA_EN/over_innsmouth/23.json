The champion with the lowest base health in the game at level 18 is Gnar, at 1645. Gnar also has a base MR of 30, which equates to a 23% magic damage reduction and a base armor of 65.5 which is a 40% reduction to physical damage. Let's cover Fizz's q first. It does damage equal to 100% AD plus 70 (+35% AP) magic damage while applying on hit effects. So, let's say Fizz has 500 AP. His base AD is 109 at lv 18, so: **65 (109 - 40%) + 189 (245 [70 + 35% AP] - 23%) = 254**. Assuming Fizz didn't purchase Lich Bane or use his passive, it would only do a measly 254 damage. This is not very realistic however, as Fizz will always use his w before q, and any Fizz player worth his salt will purchase Lich Bane, which will add 75% base AD + 50% AP as magic damage. **332 (82 + 250) - 23% = 256**. The total damage with Lich bane is **510**. And now for the fun part: his passive. It deals 60 (+45% AP) (+8% of the target's missing health). With the active enabled, it does an additional 30 (+30% AP). The total being 500 (320 [60 + 225 + 35] + 180 [30 + 150]) - 23% = 385 damage over 3 seconds. **THE TOTAL DAMAGE OF FIZZ'S Q WITH 500 AP, LICH BANE, AND HIS W ACTIVE IS 895 DAMAGE OVER 3 SECONDS**. Now, let's say Fizz has 1000 AP. He would still only do 1510 total damage, not enough to one shot Gnar, with the lowest base HP in the game. With the same build, his E would do only 497 damage at 500 AP. Even at 1000 AP it would only do 785 damage. \n\n**In conclusion! It is absolutely impossible for Fizz to one shot you with any of his abilities, even with 1000 AP**. \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wimbledofy","date":"2016-04-26T18:22:47.467+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":3,"body":"when people say 1 shot they mean 1 rotation of abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2016-04-26T18:57:57.833+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":23,"body":"Then people need to clarify that, because one shot means \"one ability useage\" to most people.
