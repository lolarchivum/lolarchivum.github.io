He is extremely broken and is picked pretty much every game. I hate facing him and it's super annoying that he is picked SO consistently. He has no real weaknesses and his passive allows him to build items that other carries would lose damage with (Maw, etc) and lose no damage for it. His Ult also hits for 2k+ late game easily and unless you have two forms of mobility to get away from it/him or around him he can ghost your movements with his + movement speed and his dash. Meaning if you are trying to kill him he can just W-Ult and kite you while you take thousands of damage, and even if you turn to disengage he can just follow you with it. It's stupid. And that's the least dumb part of his kit, the ability with the most counterplay. He also has no mana costs with Reaver and no cooldowns. His E gets partial resets in flat amounts making high amounts of CDR on him hyperscale his mobility. It also resets his autoattack for some reason. His passive basically says his autos do 60% additional damage (compared to Corki's 10% additional damage which was broken too, and was removed) his Q is almost instant and does a ton of damage, W gives him a free alacrity-enchanted boots of swiftness ON TOP of his movement speed.
