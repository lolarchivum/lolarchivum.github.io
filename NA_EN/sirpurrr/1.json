It seems like there's more shielding and healing than ever and there are also more mobile fighters running the game, like Irelia. It's bad enough to have something like Darius top lane but when getting the fighter champions mid lane, it's even tougher for Ekko. He is good vs low mobility squishies and not vs sustained damage somewhat tanky and mobile champions. Apart from not being able to assassinate them, he also has the problem that he can't setup good Ws. The whole roster now zooms around with Celerity and has a dash on top of it... it seems. How to predict W 3 seconds in advance? Even from fog of war, they just dash away.\r\n\r\nHe feels kind of useless except for waveclear and his laning is weak too. His mid game is fine but his damage actually feels really lacking late game unless you get the absolute perfect setup. Even then, you have no sustained DPS while something like Irelia can one shot late game just as fast as you AND have sustained DPS on top of it. It just feels like Ekko has only 10 minutes to shine after he gets Protobelt-Lich and then falls off a cliff vs a lot of what's meta. He also can't build bruiser like Yasuo or Irelia who are REAL carries. Ekko is supposed to be a carry too but fails at it. He needs more tankiness or more damage even if it's gated to late game. Right now mid, it's either a utility/team oriented champ like Morgana or TF or a true carry like Irelia and Yasuo. I fail vs both kinds. TF I can at least punish for roaming and laning is fine but I hate the idea that I become virtually useless late game just by virtue of my pick vs theirs. Conqueror Yasuo can block half my damage, gets tankier than me (Sterak's-PD-Mercs) even if I consider my W and R and has ridiculous DPS as well as teamfighting. And Yasuo is not even OP! That's how bad Ekko seems to me right now. Why pick him? If you really want to pick an assassin, literally all other assassins are better for the first 20 minutes at least. Zed, Fizz, Talon, Zoe (jk but almost.. hate her so much... why does she exist?) so what do you have as Ekko? You don't have early, you don't have late and mid game you are not really better than a Fizz, Talon etc. either unless the enemy team plays badly and you get a magical W for your team. Even then, great W fine, you can do that but you could have played Morgana and flash Q-Rd or whatever to basically do the same thing. So many champions have great teamfight combos so what's special about Ekko there? Sure, other assassins can't do it but there are plenty of other champs who can and Ekko fails as an assassin and as a skirmisher compared to Irelia.\r\n\r\nJG especially, ever since the scuttler changes has been really rough. Can't really play vs Graves, Xin, Udyr etc. Graves outfarms me massively due to his speed and can invade me easily. Then again, even an Eve can duel me so that's not a shocker. The problem is Graves comes with Red and has range as well as a dash. I can't run a lot of the time. Udyr is a similar issue. He powerfarms and even after I EQ sometimes he can catch me and stun. Xin just stomps my lanes so hard before I can even get Runic and if he doesn't do that, he tends to stomp me. A good one is really hard to manage. It's not even just these champions. Nearly everything considered meta from Shaco to Shyvana seems to destroy him either by powerfarming 2x faster or being incredibly stronger early and taking over the game before you can do anything. There was a time when Ekko jungle was useful and had something to contribute. Even his dashing over walls was special. Now it's just so common place and many of the picks with it can even outscale (Graves, Camille for instance). The whole concept of Ekko is prediction, setup, sneakiness. All useless if you're facing such a mobile roster with everything from Celerity, Waterwalking, to Phase Rush, to Fleet Footwork, and so on along with a million other low CD dashes for the majority of the meta roster. What is there to predict if they all just dash away like it's nothing? I have sympathy for Fiddlesticks players.","replies":[{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-06-12T20:31:03.819+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Funny, I permaban ekko because he can all in me with zero risk post 6 and his pre 6 burst isn't something to underestimate","replies":[{"poster":"Jarring","date":"2018-06-12T20:45:48.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"let me guess, you one-trick some squishy immobile mage mid? guess it would be even worse if you don't have any reliable cc. \nseems like there are plenty of better bans though even then.

The only problem is that you can itemize better against zed, meaning the zhonya's will have more importance, whereas ekko isn't AD, so the armor does nothing for you. idk what your build is but i feel just getting a little early hp helps a lot vs all-ins.. Ofc ekko still probably going to wreck u most of the time.. ekko was pretty much built to wreck champs that are anything like you. he can already own squishy mages with cc, but not having any makes it that much easier.  \nIF you were exceptionally good at landing karthus qs.. then maybe u could own an ekko before he ever got a chance to all in you, but that's asking a lot. from the sounds of it, you're scared af of the champ so it's unlikely you'd be able to land any qs.. but that's really the main factor that will win you the lane in any situation vs any champion.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PiggyTheAstro","date":"2018-06-12T19:46:14.306+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Not to disagree, I honestly think Ekko needs a buff, but not everyone has a dash...

His Q won't land 2 hits unless the enemy is literally retarded enough to stay in it for whatever reason. Well, it also happens if they start an AA just while getting hit by it. His W is almost useless in lane and the stun is too short for how hard it is to land in lane.\nEven when he gets his passive (and potentially second Q) off which is very risky, he deals less damage than a lot of other champions who can get their damage off much easier.\n\nHe has good waveclear but hardly forms a threat to the enemy laner. This allows him to roam but people can easily follow him as he can hardly 1v1 anyone without a lead. \n\nThe main problems I've experienced while playing Ekko is that no matter how you throw your Q and reposition yourself you will hardly land the second Q until the enemy makes a mistake so you're hardly rewarded.\n\nHis passive CD is quite high which means that after you encounter someone and you all in them you have nothing left for over 5 seconds early to mid-game. And again, you deal less damage than most other champs at this time so you're now a punching bag trying to time his ult to run out. (or land it if your enemy is dumb enough.)\n\nHis ult moves in a very glitch-like way making it very hard to land it as it will suddenly blink right before you use it and just miss someone. This happens way too often, it's actually sickening. Not only that, the hitbox is also kinda small, but that'd be fine if it moved a lot smoother.\n\nYou're melee and AP so you'll need your abilities to farm. This means you'll get harassed a lot while having a lot of trouble fighting back.\n\nI personally feel like giving his Q a bit more range and speed and making it pass the first enemy champion it hits a bit would give him more laning presence and better dueling.\nReducing his passive CD to 3 seconds would mean that when he manages to stick he can actually be rewarded for it instead of just standing there dealing no damage, wondering what he's doing with his life. This will also allow him to duel (assassinate I guess) picks he makes alone while in, for example, in the river. His base damage has been nerfed anyway so this won't bring tank Ekko back.\n\nMake his ult move smoother. Like, seriously, why is it still like this? When he was just released I thought it was a bug they'd fix. haHAA.\n\nAnd lastly have his passive deal a bit increased damage to minions (and maybe reduced cd vs jungle creeps?) or execute them below a certain % (say 5 - 6,5 - 8%) to actually allow him to get more cs instead of standing there, watching minions die while his abilities are on cooldown. {{item:3070}} \n\nThese seem like decent quality of life changes that will give him a better spot in the mid lane without completely breaking him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2018-06-13T04:05:36.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good thing they added extra effects to his W so it isn’t solely an unreliable stun ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2018-06-12T20:41:47.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure Ekko was super strong in many seasons, and if you posted this during those seasons you would be downvoted to oblivion. \n\nLet's face it, Ekko can be fixed by tweaking numbers and revisiting some items a little. that's all he needs. \nsure you can also go about it by changing W too, but I think items need to be looked into more. \nI particularly think echo would benefit TREMENDOUSLY if Riot implemented this:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/o8bp1AEK-this-idea-to-help-with-item-balance-for-scaling-items\n\nbecause you shouldn't have to always get {{item:3089}} on {{champion:245}} , and so other AP items could cost a tiny bit less without deathcap.

It seems like there&amp;#039;s more shielding and healing than ever and there are also more mobile fighters running the game, like Irelia. It&amp;#039;s bad enough to have something like Darius top lane but when getting the fighter champions mid lane, it&amp;#039;s even tougher for Ekko. He is good vs low mobility squishies and not vs sustained damage somewhat tanky and mobile champions. Apart from not being able to assassinate them, he also has the problem that he can&amp;#039;t setup good Ws. The whole roster now zooms around with Celerity and has a dash on top of it... it seems. How to predict W 3 seconds in advance? Even from fog of war, they just dash away.\n> \n> He feels kind of useless except for waveclear and his laning is weak too. His mid game is fine but his damage actually feels really lacking late game unless you get the absolute perfect setup. Even then, you have no sustained DPS while something like Irelia can one shot late game just as fast as you AND have sustained DPS on top of it. It just feels like Ekko has only 10 minutes to shine after he gets Protobelt-Lich and then falls off a cliff vs a lot of what&amp;#039;s meta. He also can&amp;#039;t build bruiser like Yasuo or Irelia who are REAL carries. Ekko is supposed to be a carry too but fails at it. He needs more tankiness or more damage even if it&amp;#039;s gated to late game. Right now mid, it&amp;#039;s either a utility/team oriented champ like Morgana or TF or a true carry like Irelia and Yasuo. I fail vs both kinds. TF I can at least punish for roaming and laning is fine but I hate the idea that I become virtually useless late game just by virtue of my pick vs theirs. Conqueror Yasuo can block half my damage, gets tankier than me (Sterak&amp;#039;s-PD-Mercs) even if I consider my W and R and has ridiculous DPS as well as teamfighting. And Yasuo is not even OP! That&amp;#039;s how bad Ekko seems to me right now. Why pick him? If you really want to pick an assassin, literally all other assassins are better for the first 20 minutes at least. Zed, Fizz, Talon, Zoe (jk but almost.. hate her so much... why does she exist?) so what do you have as Ekko? You don&amp;#039;t have early, you don&amp;#039;t have late and mid game you are not really better than a Fizz, Talon etc. either unless the enemy team plays badly and you get a magical W for your team. Even then, great W fine, you can do that but you could have played Morgana and flash Q-Rd or whatever to basically do the same thing. So many champions have great teamfight combos so what&amp;#039;s special about Ekko there? Sure, other assassins can&amp;#039;t do it but there are plenty of other champs who can and Ekko fails as an assassin and as a skirmisher compared to Irelia.\n> \n> JG especially, ever since the scuttler changes has been really rough. Can&amp;#039;t really play vs Graves, Xin, Udyr etc. Graves outfarms me massively due to his speed and can invade me easily. Then again, even an Eve can duel me so that&amp;#039;s not a shocker. The problem is Graves comes with Red and has range as well as a dash. I can&amp;#039;t run a lot of the time. Udyr is a similar issue. He powerfarms and even after I EQ sometimes he can catch me and stun. Xin just stomps my lanes so hard before I can even get Runic and if he doesn&amp;#039;t do that, he tends to stomp me. A good one is really hard to manage. It&amp;#039;s not even just these champions. Nearly everything considered meta from Shaco to Shyvana seems to destroy him either by powerfarming 2x faster or being incredibly stronger early and taking over the game before you can do anything. There was a time when Ekko jungle was useful and had something to contribute. Even his dashing over walls was special. Now it&amp;#039;s just so common place and many of the picks with it can even outscale (Graves, Camille for instance). The whole concept of Ekko is prediction, setup, sneakiness. All useless if you&amp;#039;re facing such a mobile roster with everything from Celerity, Waterwalking, to Phase Rush, to Fleet Footwork, and so on along with a million other low CD dashes for the majority of the meta roster. What is there to predict if they all just dash away like it&amp;#039;s nothing? I have sympathy for Fiddlesticks players.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not make E size scale with something? like how {{item:3025}} scales with armor, his E radius could scale off something.","replies":[{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2018-06-13T03:05:59.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=novac3721,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h2fOYVXU,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2018-06-12T23:08:41.773+0000)\n>\n> Why not make E size scale with something? like how {{item:3025}} scales with armor, his E radius could scale off something.\n\nThat sounds awkward to learn.
