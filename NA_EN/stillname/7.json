Well the mage update is &quot;soon&quot; and I think it would be helpful to think about what went right and what went wrong in the last big class update before jumping into a new one if Riot is willing to take our feedback.\r\n\r\nThe original goals were to add build path choices to all Marksman so every game isn&#039;t building the same thing and to add diversity to the marksman role by giving each ADC their own niche.\r\n\r\nWhat worked (imo):\r\n\r\n* There are more than 2 viable buildpaths for all ADC&#039;s. Individually there may only be 1 with small changes but as a whole it&#039;s not just build botrk path or build IE path.\r\n* ADC&#039;s do feel different from each other.\r\n* {{item:3087}} and{{item:3094}} actually serve different purposes. This is one of the biggest wins because it is very difficult for two similar items like these to co-exist in the game and I am very surprised riot pulled it off.\r\n* Build paths on any given ADC are somewhat game dependent. Usually building 2 core items every game then deciding what 3rd and 4th items should be depending on enemy champions and current game-state which didn&#039;t exist before. \r\n\r\nWhat Failed (imo):\r\n\r\n* {{champion:104}} Let&#039;s face it he got reworked right out of the marksman role and he is a bruiser now. Even worse he is a bruiser with some range. It&#039;s not just his balance either he could be nerfed to the point where he doesn&#039;t see as much play like the other bruisers but he would still be a bruiser disguised as a marksman.\r\n* {{item:3078}} This item is barely used by anyone anymore and a lot of the champions that do use don&#039;t use everything on it with the exception of {{champion:42}}  and he abuses it.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning some of the bruiser items like {{item:3156}} and {{item:3053}} being op on marksman but I am not going to include those as a part of the marksman update because they are their own separate balance problem and marksman aren&#039;t the only ones abusing them.\r\n\r\nTLDR; marksman update had some success and some failure.

So just think about how it works now, and don't use it when you shouldn't, and do use it when you should.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-04-01T01:54:42.339+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now, I do feel like most ADCs have a niche that feels good to play, though there are still some outliers. Blue Ezreal is really annoying. Apparently, Graves is still OP (I never see him in my games though).\n\nAnd then there's Lucian. To me, as an ADC player, it feels like the meta is really choking out other options. Lucian is actually one of my favorite champions right now, so I don't mind playing him, but so many times I just find myself defaulting back to Lucian since he's so well-rounded. A lot of champions feel like their niches' are too narrow that if just one pick goes against the plan, then it's just safer to play Lucian. Or just in general, since there are a lot of champions (ie. MF, Sivir, Ashe, Caitlyn) that work really well in a coordinated team with a suitable composition, but those are hard to come by unless you're 5maning in dynamic, so Lucian is just the default pick.\n\nAs far as itemization, I'm pretty happy with it. Your Zeal item does feel like a legitimate choice that you vary depending on the game. You also have options as far as lifesteal, at least Mercurial vs. BT. LW doesn't feel as oppressive as it was before. You have some options as far as boots, depending on your champion (I get ionian on Lucian). ER does open some cool options for caster style ADCs. There are, of course, still problems, but overall itemization feels much better than before.\n\nMasteries feel pretty good as well (Warlord's is stupid right now, ty for incoming nerfs)","replies":[{"poster":"KETSU0","date":"2016-04-01T04:45:27.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How was lw oppressive?","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-04-01T19:10:31.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least anecdotally, it felt like once i got old last whisper, I could just melt through anything.

Marksmen have more viable lanes options as well which is also good.\n\n My problem is that the strong adc's feel too strong early and the weak early champs don't have any legitimate pay off for putting up with the weakness. The only exception is Kog and he isn't a \"late spiking champ\" anymore. He spikes at 2 items and that is about as strong as he gets and aside from just becoming actually unbalanced for a few patches he didn't have the staying power lucian or Ez have had. The is no reason to pick trist when you have jinx and there is no reason to pick Jinx when sivir is safer in lane does aoe crits too and still brings utility if she lost early. Just because Corki and graves can be played in other lanes doesn't mean we don't have the classic 3 adc S tier we have always had. The main thing is why draft a adc with a little more dps than lucian you trade tons of safety and lane strength? If the pay off for picking Trist twitch and Jinx was actually worth it or is supports that help them come back then we would have more diversity. Or we may just go full circle. \n\nI feel like Caitlyn may be the crown jewel of this update as she has a clear niche a well defined power curve with strong points and weak points and is perfectly viable while not being oppressive.

Instead of fixing the outlier ADCs and giving them niche's, they gave them the dominant spot. They even reworked items to force them that way (whether they meant to or not). In fact they screwed up itemization so hard the base power level of most ADCs shifted upwards even ones that weren't touched. So yes it was a success for their goal, but it had so many negative consequences that we are at the state we are at now. They did too much at one time. They screwed up wit masteries by almost doubling their power and then increased the average ADC's power by about 10-15%.\n\nThey need to look at the problem that is ADC's obtaining 70+% crit chance with no hinderance to AD and also how durable ADC's are as well as how many items were made to favor them and then turned out to be better on someone else. Like Atma's Impaler was meant for them but was used by ADCs but turned into a tank item.

Caster ADCs are no longer forced into awkward builds to get the CDR they need, on-hit builds are back (and probably a little too strong), and marksmen generally have more than one item set they can work with.\n* More diverse playstyles and contributions. Marksman viability is now more reliant on the contributions each individual champion can make, rather than just whether the game as a whole favors early game bullies or hypercarries.\n* Balance issues aside, the marksman changes were overall very successful. Graves is finally a proper shotgun champion (even if he's a bit too strong), Corki now has a well-defined role and Quinn/Miss Fortune's kits make sense.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\n* Crit wasn't reworked. The marksman update was a golden opportunity to overhaul a stat that is not only core to the class, but also out of place in the current state of the game. Crit should be a stat that adds gameplay to the marksman class, plus power that feels appropriate for them, rather than just additional, RNG-reliant damage. Instead, its numbers were shifted around to take randomness as much out of the equation as possible, effectively turning it into a relatively boring autoattack damage multiplier. If the stat had been redone, there would've likely been even more opportunities for cool new items, new builds and interesting per-champion synergies besides the artificial crit scalings that were added.\n* Item builds are still pretty static. Marksmen got items more tailored to their unique playstyles, but each individual marksman still ends up building pretty much the same 3-4 items every game. Even though there are a lot more reactive picks than before, marksmen as a class still have far more proactive builds than anyone else, which still limits their itemization diversity.\n\nOverall, I feel the update did its job pretty well, which was that of bringing some much-needed diversity to marksmen and their items, but there are a lot of deeper issues regarding and surrounding marksmen that still need to be addressed. Aside from marksmen still not being all that diverse relative to other classes in terms of gameplay or contributions, the core problem with marksmen is that they feel far too important to the game compared to everyone else: whereas any other class is interchangeable (except for supports), marksmen are impossible to dislodge, and come late-game pretty much everything boils down to protecting them, even when there's another hyperscaling champion on the team. Perhaps this isn't something that can be solved by addressing marksmen directly, but it's definitely a problem they're heavily involved in.","replies":[]}]}
