I'm just waiting to see if they did anything special with her VFX. You can't have a Blood Moon skin anymore without those VFX, and special recall, that the newer skins in the line have made a standard. Hopefully they didn't leave Akali behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowdrift","date":"2018-07-17T04:13:48.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WhateverL0L,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=tbkYkgGj,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2018-07-17T04:07:12.353+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m kinda sad to see the old splash go, it was the reason why I got the skin in the first place.
