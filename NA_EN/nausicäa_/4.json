Like a way to reduce armor(not a typo, just a way of supporting the team's AD members) to your targets or somehow shift your movement speed slows to attack speed slows (with mitigated results, like 1/4 or 1/3 obviously), etc.\n\nOr, since her damage output has been shifted towards her Q so heavily, maybe a stacking mechanic. This could help her deal with tanks for example by having a small amount of % dmg in there. Nothing too strong though, just something like \"the first target hit with Ice Shard will have a X stack applied to them. Ring of Frost will apply a X stack if it roots only a single target. Max stacks of 5. Upon casting Frozen Tomb on the target, the stacks are consumed and deal an extra 2% of max hp as magic damage per stack.\"\n\nThis gives an incentive to play around a little before casting Frozen Tomb, stacking up with Ice shard. Additionally, since it's the first target hit only, the lane poke wouldn't contribute to this. In general, it gives a reason for her to do an extended close combat skirmish in order to have the maximum possible damage output. In general, we are talking about ~6-8 seconds of having to be in medium range before going for the tomb.\n\n\n\nWhether you find these passives possible or not, please take into serious consideration the Q buff if her passive goes, because it something that she could use, since all her utility is soft-cc(except for frozen tomb), she should at least have a decent amount of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2014-11-26T05:11:58.324+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"What if a shield was attached to her W instead of her passive. eg: she gains a shield whose strength scales with with number of enemy champions rooted.

What if Lissandra has a passive that slowly stacks, up to a cap, say 5. Each stack grants her bonus resistances, however, each spell she casts consumes one stack and grants bonus damage/utility (maybe applies a debuff like others are saying). This hopefully creates the interesting play between saving stacks to be tanky or using them to deal more damage (sort of like how Ori can keep the ball on herself for resistances or send it out to apply pressure), and sort of fits with her old playstyle of waiting longer between spell casts for the free spell. Thematically it's like she's gathering ice that she uses as armor, but also consumes to use as a weapon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-11-26T05:56:17.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was deliberate because of how her passive functions...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2014-11-26T04:40:14.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool thanks for the response.\n\nId still really like to see her Q range increased at least a small amount.

It would encourage interesting decision making on both sides of a lane, where both Liss and her opponent would want to keep tabs on whether her passive is up or not.\n\nGiven her identity as a CC mage, I think it would be most fitting if the changes were relayed solely to her CC rather than damage.\n\nFor instance:\n\n**Passive : Iceborn**\n\nLissandra's next ability gains an additional effect.\n\nIce Shard: Gains X% slow.\nRing of Frost: Gains .X seconds snare.\nGlacial Path: Slows enemies by X% around Lissandra when cast. (*More helpful for escapes.*)\nFrozen Tomb: Slows enemies by an additional X%.\n\n\nI didn't bother adding numbers, since I'm not a game balancer. xD But anyway, I think a passive like this would be cool, but also add a LOT of balancing levers to Lissandra to add or remove power as needed, and I think each effect has it's own benefits; there wouldn't be only one ability the player would use it on. It would depend on the situation. Some are great for initiating and some are better for escaping.\n\nThe time-based thing might be difficult for players, but I think a charge system like Annie's could be used for more reliability.\n\nAlso, obviously, you could change the effects, like maybe it's more fitting for a charged q to slow all targets hit instead, or for a charged e to reduce the cooldown.
