The designer of Zed said while making him they needed to find a way to make sure once he got to late game he didn't just lose outright, The Reaping passive was so that Zed would be more of a niche pick and not bully out the rest of the assassins from being picked. I can tell you with certainty it does neither of those things. When Zed kills his enemy under deathmark at level 6, he will gain 8 AD for free along with 300gold(8 AD is worth 280g). As you can see this basically means he's killed you twice. The Reaping passive didn't change anything about how or when Zed should be picked, instead it added a really shitty mini game that nobody likes, and makes Zed's power curve wonky.\n\nDo I agree with his opinion on how Zed should be balanced? No. But his facts presented go to show that Zed needs some kind of nerf, I can agree with that much. And I think his idea is certainly better than doing nothing at all.\n\nHe admitted a lot of things. First, that Zed can kill early easily, elsewise this wouldn't be an 'early game nerf' in the first place. Second, he admitted that a Zed that kills simply scales harder than other champs. Of course, we can say the same thing about Veigar and Cho'Gath. It's worth debating whether champs should have such mechanics, but it's in the game and some people(including me) find it fun. Maybe a compromise  could be reached where this mechanic of AD reaping could go on another champion, maybe Kayn after he completes his transformation, so that he isn't immediately doubling gold value from killing enemy champs in the early game. Just an example. Not saying whether Kayn needs or doesn't need changes/buffs/nerfs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-12-02T12:37:12.708+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":5,"body":"Im 100% sure that didnt happened, show us a replay.","replies":[{"poster":"Abuse me","date":"2018-12-02T13:15:12.107+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"zeds combo lvl 4 with longsword is 464 damage.

Is that actually balanced or is that just balanced for the small proportion of the playerbase that fall almost exactly on that average? \n\nYou want homogenization?
