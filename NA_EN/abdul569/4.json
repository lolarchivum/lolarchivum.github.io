I hate to break it to you but your opinion isn't very valuable on this subject. I would also like to mention that a real psychologist needs to actually spend time with a person to learn what is actually going on.

Whether or not he is licensed in a field is irrelevant with regards to his ability to formulate an opinion, presumably based off legitimate data and you know, being in possession of a human brain.\n\nThat being said, I find some merit in his approach.

I am not saying that the research he has is worthless. It isn't. What I am saying   is that I and everyone else on these boards has no way to verify that he isn't just making stuff up. They just posted a very inflammatory response about our current president without providing a single shred of evidence. Then when I called them out on it I got a response about how their experience can tell them and how their is \"a bunch of evidence\". \n\nNow he very well potentially could have good grasp of psychology, I don't know that. Furthermore I am personally trained in the medical field and I know firsthand how complex medicine (including psychology) is. I see smart people all the time research medications for example and then self medicate and then develop some serious illness or make their problem worse or have some negative side effect. I also see doctors and psychologists make mistakes all the time. So if a highly trained and highly skilled specialists makes mistakes. How much easier is it for a random person with no formal training to make a mistake?\n\n I am not trying to stand on a pedestal. Ignorance in the medical field is very very common and most \"self trained ______\" are very bad at what they are trying to do. Which is exactly why no one will give them a job doing whatever it is they are trained in. Which goes back to why we have licenses in the first place. To make sure that every single psychologist (or any medical provider) has a minimum amount of training that qualifies them for the position and that we as the public can trust them because they have that.","replies":[{"poster":"9 X","date":"2017-01-26T20:02:38.984+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nCalm down toots, we're talking into a vacuum *(need I remind you, MEMES AND GAMES)* the Trump family will never ever hear, so all this talk of qualifications, certifications, licenses and etcetera all for the sake of expressing one's thoughts on a trivial matter is just silly.
