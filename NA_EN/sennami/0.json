The top laner kept pushing, getting ganked, and dying. I told them to not push if the enemy jg is so focused on top. That is when they began targeting me. They told me to \"go back to the kitchen\" which I guess, maybe because I play support, they assumed I was female. They proceeded to tell me \"my body shape was my worth\" and their duo followed up with \"fat bitch\". I wish I took photos, but I wasn't thinking straight after they put me down like that. Not to mention top was 0/16 and diving the enemy base (two-three towers deep) and I was trying to think up a way to come back. I reported it and someone watching it happen also reported it and I've heard nothing back.

I am not 100% on how the punishment system works and that is one of the reasons I came to this board. I want to know if I could expect something in response or if it's unlikely anything will be done. I am just so used to seeing instant feedback reports afterwards that I thought we would always receive them if something is being done about the report. ","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-09-10T19:57:20.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The feedback notification has always been sporadic.  You do not always get it.  Before, you can only get it if your report is the one that got someone punished AND you are literally the very last person to report that person before the punishment (it means in the same game, if you and someone else reported that person and that someone else hit report after you did, then he would get it and you don't).  Rito changed it to everyone can potentially get it at some point later on.  You still only get the notification (I THINK) less than 50% of the time even if your report got someone punished though.\n\nRito reasoning for making that notification sporadic are to let the player base know that their reports matter and something is being done about it, but they don't want to make the notification 100% every time you report someone because they don't want people to start \"trophy hunt\" to get people punished.\n\nI personally do not agree with their reasonings.  I think turning it into a mystery whether someone got punished or not is just dumb.  They need to either make it 100% or make it 0%.  Making it somewhere in the middle just confuses the player base and give the perception that \"I got punished, but the toxic flamers don't\".\n\nAs for knowing if someone is punished or not, even if you receive a notification, you may not even know if that person got punished or not if you also reported other people.  What I mean by that is if you played 5 games and you reported 3 people in those games.  If you receive a notification, you don't know which one got punished.  The dumb sporadic notification also doesn't help.  If someone received a Chat Restriction from your report, there is literally no way to stalk someone's account to see if they got punished or not because CR gives zero indication in match histories (as oppose to 14-day where you can see a hole in their play pattern).  Therefore you can never claim someone didn't get punished with any real certainty because you may not received notification even if they are punished or they may get CR and you will never be able to find out.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-10T20:31:55.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> They need to either make it 100% or make it 0%.\n\nThe point of this whole thing is that none of us are supposed to be focusing on what happens to another player.

They'll bitch nothing being done nonetheless.  But with 50%, people know there exists notifications and same with the IFS, majority of them do not understand how the system works so they assume they always get notification if someone is punished (we've seen plenty on this board to extrapolate the truth of this assumption).  It not only create the feelings of nothing being done (same with 0%), but it always create the feeling that nothing being done with THEIR reports (which is even worse feelings).\n\nIn a perfect world, everyone should understand how the IFS works and how the notification works.  But that's not reality and Rito is not too keen on stepping up educating the masses on how the IFS and notifications work.  Personally, I think it's better for people to feel \"nothing being done\" than \"nothing being done with MY reports\". It feels a lot more personal than Rito not doing jack with ANY reports.\n\nI don't dwell on the past.  I understand I will lose 40-60% of all my games.  Trolls, flamers, afk, inters don't bother me much.  With or without them, I will not win 100% winrate.  I don't care if my reports get them punished.  I did my job.  I reported them.

And I personally think in its current state the system could use some more transparency. If people don't feel like their reports make a difference then that can be a serious problem.\n\nHow many people come to these forums with serious misconceptions about whether their single reports actually make a difference when others gang up on them? How many of those people then mistakenly think retaliating is the better alternative to reporting?\nHow many people, as a more general point, behave the way they do because they don't believe they will get caught?\n\nI'm not excusing those people's actions, but the ultimate goal of Riot's system is to reduce toxicity. If toxicity can be reduced already by increasing trust in / fear of the system then I believe that is an angle that needs to be explored.\n\nI come to these forums often enough to know that the system works reasonably well. If I didn't, I would have probably stopped reporting people by now, because I hardly ever see any tangible evidence that my reports actually have any impact at all.\nIf my reports were completely discarded without any review whatsoever I couldn't tell the difference.
