For reference, these are the current balance changes on the PBE:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#balance\r\n\r\nLet me provide you with 3 examples to make my point. \r\n\r\n**Example 1\r\n**\r\nFirst, let&#039;s look at blitzcrank. On the PBE, his base armor has been buffed by +20. This is nice. \r\n\r\nNow let&#039;s look at the runes that blitzcrank players use. Again, optimal rune setup is not the same as most common. If I go to http://na.op.gg/champion/blitzcrank/statistics/support, click on runes, and then order by winrate, we see a highly customized, special rune page for blitz players. 9 flat armor, 3 move speed quints, 9 flat mana, 8 ad and one crit chance.\r\n\r\nNow I know crit chance is going away. Instead of +20 armor on blitz, why not do +8.5 ad, + 9 armor, +101.3 mana, +14.625 move speed (4.5/100 * 325 = 14.625, 4.5% is the runes, 325 is his base movespeed) . I apologize if I&#039;m sounding ridiculous here, but this is an honest and serious question. Blitz players (like me!) will use a page like that specifically because:\r\n\r\n* the move speed helps get in range for hooks quicker, allowing you to get that first blood more reliably in jungle invades\r\n* the +100 mana gives you an extra hook that you can safely fire. Increasing the base mana makes him a much bigger threat in lane phase.\r\n* the AD is for damage to help prep CS and trade, and the 9 Armor is again to help trading.\r\n\r\nSo my first question to you: how can I play blitzcrank the same way with runes reforged? Yes, I know that there are options like celerity (+4% movespeed), but the 6 runes we get to choose are ALSO replacing the 30 different mastery choices we have (in which I&#039;d take +3% movespeed out of combat). So you could argue that the runes reforged make up for base stats that you&#039;re not giving blitz, but the argument that it&#039;s making up for the base stats you&#039;re not giving and that it&#039;s making up for the masteries which are going away seems like a bit of a stretch.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example #2. Shyvana.\r\n**\r\nOn the PBE, shyvana&#039;s armor has been buffed by  +9 and her base ad has been buffed by 8.3 (less than 8.5 which is the standard 9 ad reds).\r\n\r\nHowever, again, going to http://na.op.gg/champion/shyvana/statistics/jungle, and looking at the highest win rate rune page, we see a specialized rune page for shyvana: attack speed reds, attack speed quints, scaling resists for yellows and blues. How can you make the argument that the base stat changes you did for shyvana are &quot;optimal.&quot; They are nowhere near optimal! Shyvana wants high attack speed (she goes devourer challenging smite) because she wants to autoattack to keep her burnout active for as long duration as possible. Shyvana wants high attack speed because of her AA&gt; Q &gt; titantic combo which does a high amount of burst damage late game. The scaling resists are there because shyvana is meant to scale like a monster into the late game.\r\n\r\nWhy can&#039;t you buff her attack speed by 0.189504 (28.8% of her base attack speed, 0.658), make that her new base attack speed, and then do some simple math so that the scaling % attack speed value per level is reduced such that her final attack speed at level 18 with the new base matches the final attack speed at level 18 with the old base (because buffing the base without nerfing the scaling would mean she gets even more attack speed per level and would be OP late game). Why can&#039;t you buff her armor and MR growth stats as well. Why is it that every champion is getting the same cookie cutter +9 armor and + 8ish attack damage buff (and yes, I&#039;m aware on PBE the new machete gives attack speed, but then that leads to a whole other problem: what if someone wants to play shyvana top? Then the attack speed which has been transferred over to the machete is not even available to her!)\r\n\r\n**Example #3: Scaling HP\r\n**\r\n\r\nNunu, Zac, J4, Maokai, Cho&#039;Gath, Sejuani --especially when played as junglers--take scaling hp yellows (+216 HP at level 18) over flat armor. Low mmr players take flat armor because it helps them clear, but anyone at higher levels of play will take scaling hp because it is straight up better i.e. the optimal set up. But I look at these champions on the PBE, and again, their HP growth stat has been unadjusted, while they got the same cookie cutter + 9 armor buff. Why?\r\n\r\n**BONUS example**\r\n\r\nJ4 jungle is my favorite role. I currently am running a HIGHLY specialized rune page: 5 ad reds, 2 attack speed reds, 2 lethality reds, 5 scaling hp yellows, 4 flat armor yellows, 9 attack speed blues, 2 attack damage quints, 1 attack speed quint. The stats are 3.2 lethality, 13.6% attack speed, 9.2 AD, 4 armor , and +120 HP at level 18.\r\n\r\nNOW, I know riot has stated they want to get rid of this min/maxing that occurs with rune pages. I agree with you that it is unhealthy for the game in that it doesn&#039;t allow for true diversity, which runes reforged is attemptint to solve. That is not what I&#039;m mad about.\r\n\r\nThis bonus example is meant to highlight a different issue I don&#039;t think riot has considered. By sacrificing the +12 MR from blues, and then doing min maxing, I have effectively decided to forgo defence in the favor of even more offense. When I currently run this page on live, my clear speed is totally bonkers and I come out of the jungle healthier than if I were to use a standard rune page (and I use this to snowball an advantage and eventually win the game). \r\n\r\nI know what riot has done: they&#039;ve removed the +12 MR and they&#039;ve removed the + 8 magic pen in an effort to cancel each other out. However, this &quot;cancellation&quot; presupposes the fact that everyone would have taken +12 MR in the first place, and in this bonus example, that is not the case! So how can runes reforged address this issue? How can the new runes allow me to go &quot;all in&quot; on offense and take 0 defense?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m hoping someone can see this. I feel like no one sees what I post on the forums :(","replies":[{"poster":"AgentBlack","date":"2017-11-01T03:00:31.437+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"They also said these are unlikely to be the only long term changes, and they're prepared to do follow-up work on Champions that need it.

My *preference* would be running MS quints and CDR blues, but I can't really do that because my item scaling relies on a page full of flat pen that is otherwise impossible to obtain. \n\nOf course, not every niche rune page will be represented in Reforged. But here I am as a Zyra player, and *only* my niche pages are represented in Reforged. The pages responsible for Zyra's mid-game power and late-game scaling aren't represented at all, and nothing in Reforged is in the same universe power-wise as the current pen page. It's mathematically impossible for Reforged to break even power-wise with the 21-26 flat pen Zyra gets from current runes + Precision, particularly against players like OP's Jarvan who skip MR blues.\n\nThere's a Grand Canyon between not preserving peripheral playstyles and not preserving a champ's iconic, core playstyle. Can you give a satisfactory response about why there is no combination of runes for pen-stacking champs? Zyra is the best example, but Brand, Kat, and a bunch of ADs often run high pen rune setups. In the case of many ADs, they run lethality runes and don't buy lethality items, so the pen item buffs aren't making up for any of that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-11-02T00:27:43.525+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"If I had any answer for you on Zyra specifically I would give it.

Allow me to try again from a different angle.\n\n1) Why are pregame pen stats being removed from the game? This applies to a larger group champs than just Zyra, though it's a discreet set of builds being left behind rather than entire champs.\n\n2) You can't account for every stat combo in the new rune system. That said, you do account for every *individual* stat in the new system to the exclusion of pen stats. Why was pen singled out for exclusion when every other stat was singled out for inclusion?\n\n3) Pregame pen options had a very specific value to me specifically. Not because of Zyra specifically but because it gives the player more direct control over their power spikes in a way that is less predictable at a glance. There's also a clear tradeoff between higher AP/AD scaling and more situational, windowed power.\n\n4) Can you explain mathematically what kind of individual champ buffs can recreate the loss of stacked pregame pen?

If we give this specialized increase of mana and movement speed, then Blitz players are going to simply have 11 less armor than every other melee support. \n\nNow, what will happen when this change is static (in other words, when low level players are **forced** to use armor instead of other runes like MR penetration or flat MR)? Well, what will happen is that Riot will adjust marksman damage and base stats around how much damage they can deal to these immense tanks especially early in the game. And if Blitzcrank doesn't have that high armor like Leona and Braum do, he's going to be at a severe disadvantage. \n\nAlso, live Blitzcrank does not have access to Aftershock. Aftershock gives a percentage of armor, rather than the % of health that Courage of Colossus does. So Blitzcrank would simply get less value out of Aftershock than Braum or Leona if the changes you suggest go live. \n\nYou say that top lane Shyvana wants attack speed. That's debatable, but even if she does, Shyvana now has access to a brand new Keystone that gives her 60% attack speed and the ability to break the attack speed cap. With that in mind, dishing out attack speed probably isn't something that's safe for Riot to do without good reason.\n\nScaling Health - As a Nunu player, believe me this annoys me as well. However, I've played the new runes on the PBE and the Overgrowth rune is more than enough of this HP growth. You will have more than 216 health from Overgrowth by level 18, it's fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DracosKasu","date":"2017-11-01T14:19:14.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"LEt be real we all know that the optimal runes page for each character will be reveal after the pbe test.
