In case you were wondering, I was completely reformed for an entire month and all the games before this. I was a positive player and tried my hardest to cooperate with and teach my teammates... And then I got permanently suspended for using the words &quot;noob&quot; and &quot;toxic&quot; in a game where I was constantly harassed by my team for having a bad game... \nAlso, Riot failed to email me explaining why I was punished as they always do, so I&#039;d like for that to happen.\nChat logs are in the comments, now (edit)\nI would also like someone from Riot to explain why I was permanently banned using my logs from different recent games and this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-07-14T19:52:44.318+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"You were not perma banned for saying noob.\n\nYou were penalized because you have a long history of harassment without any change in your behavior after numerous penalties.\n\nYou have had 2 10-game chat restrictions, a 25-game chat restriction, and a 14-day ban before your perma.

This includes online and offline. Just because a person does something doesn't mean you don't choose how you react to it. You simply chose a negative way and were punished for it.\n\nThe issue is with all these threads complaining over bans is you willingly signed the TOS.

Ping can communicate basically anything we need to at this point and plenty of people make it to Diamond+ using no chat and only pings anyway. Just my thoughts, and to be honest I would love an option to completely remove chat from my game anyway because being flamed by my team for doing poorly or the enemy team for doing well actually gets to me after a while. Games can take a big toll on emotions and I report my fair share of people but I don't report everyone that gets me heated from time to time. But that way, at least you could still communicate, and you wouldn't \"rob\" people of things they spent large amounts of money on.

This was just the game they decided to give to ban you on.\nReform period doesn't last a month. It can last upwards of 90 days, so just because you were 'polite for 30 days' doesn't mean you have reformed.\nAs far as account worth, does it matter if you spent 1$ or 1700$ on league? League says no(i'm sure there is some lenianace for those who spend more, but they won't admit to it ; ) ) toxicity is toxicity, its equal across the board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-14T19:29:32.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you only get one game, that doesn't necessarily mean that it was the only game you were punished for.
