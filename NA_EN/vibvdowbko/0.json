You'll get 20% from Spirit Visage, but that's about it. Not to mention that shen's base only overtake's Riven's at level 5. Levels 1-4, Riven has stronger shield before accounting for scaling and the cooldown is only 1 second longer before cooldown reduction. Add in the fact that it has a dash and shen's becomes completely out of date. The only advantage his shield has over Riven's is the 3 second duration, but at the same time, activating it means he can't use all of his abilities without first taunting someone. \n\nShen needs some quality of life changes bad and Feint is where its needed most.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-06-14T21:36:10.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then there's Ekko with a 50 mana skill that stuns, and gives him a 150 health shield based on what he's building, AND has a passive that lets him death % missing health damage.
