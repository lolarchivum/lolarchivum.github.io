He therefore has good presence mid and good success as well.\nZed has a 50.63% win rate and a 10.35% play rate. He therefore has a very large presence mid, along with good success there.\nLeBlanc has a 46.78% win rate and a 15.67% play rate. Her win rate isn't amazing, but she is literally the most popular mid laner in the game.\nKatarina has a 52.4% win rate and a 4.78% play rate. She's not as popular as the others (though still not bad by any means), but is among the more successful mid lane champions.\nKassadin has a 49.17% win rate and a 8.74% play rate. He therefore has good presence mid, as well as reasonably good success.\nYasuo has a 50.19% win rate and a 11.18% play rate. He therefore has a very large presence mid, as well as good success.\nSo effectively, outside of pro play, assassins are already both highly present and successful in mid lane. Assassins are among the top-performing mid lane champions, with 5 out of the top 10 mid laners, and 2 out of the top 4, being assassins. The same applies when ranking in terms of popularity, and 6 out of the 10 most-banned mid laners are assassins. Meanwhile, iconic mid lane mages like Lux, Syndra, Vel'Koz, Viktor, Xerath and Ziggs all have play rates under 4% (many of these champions in fact have play rates barely above 1%), along with win rates under 50%. With these mana changes, Riot is therefore setting out to unbalance the game for practically the entirety of League's playerbase, purely to address a problem that affects a tiny subset of players, and so in a manner that is unlikely to even resolve the actual issue. It's a terrible idea that is going to generate negative feedback for months, if not years on end, depending on how quickly it gets addressed, and the solution here should be to make changes that specifically target pro play, instead of screwing over literal thousands, if not millions of other players.****","replies":[{"poster":"FrostQueensPlane","date":"2018-04-23T02:23:01.272+0000","up_votes":157,"down_votes":21,"body":"There's is literally NOTHING enjoyable in a mage vs {{champion:7}} or{{champion:157}}or{{champion:55}}  match up BECAUSE ONE SIDE HAS BEEN GIVEN ALL THE TOOLS TO OUTPLAY THE OTHER RIOT GAMES AND ONE TOUCH FROM THEIR ABILITIES CAN COST YOU YOUR FUCKING LANE, yet _<Removed by Moderation>_ is perplexed as to why mages choose to abandon \"laning\" completely and opt to clear waves.

There are certain aspects that champions must have in order to be picked.\n\nThe biggest thing is range vs melee.\nIf a champion is ranged, then it's almost always a carry champion. Mostly, an ADC or a Mage. (Enchanters supports also exist here). Generally, they are squishy, but they have the ability to provide insane damage and most of the team comp revolves around them.\n\nMelee champions are quite more complex though. Since being melee means that you put yourself in danger in order to deal damage, most of the time you want tanky champions. Also, a tank champion on its own isn't enough, you need that champion to be able to do something active, rather than being just a meatshield. So, for example, Mundo is useless, because he's just a meatshield. That's why you pick tanks you have a lot of CC, engage, interrupts etc. Sion has a lot of that, Ornn, Maokai, Chogath have quite a lot, while also being extremely tanky and have some damage.\n\nSo, you either pick CC melee tanks, and high DPS ranged characters. That's the basic philosophy. Sure, you see top lane carries like Fiora, or Jungle carries like KhaZIx. \n\nHaving some way to assist the team with a semi-global ability also is a huge thing. That's why things like Galio, Sion, Taliyah and Ryze are so contested picks.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AyoLiko420","date":"2018-04-23T07:24:32.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Please elaborate on alot of mages are Viable.. ill explain theyre not.. dnt use Annie, Ruze or Syndra as examples even exclude veigar and lux.. theyre mainstream op is expected.. but honestly some real playable champs that u wouldnt mind laning against or using.. mages","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2018-04-23T10:13:52.112+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"explain to me why mages are good but don't show any good mages as examples because they don't count\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2018-04-23T06:27:39.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apart from Kha it's mostly Sej/Trundle/Olaf with a splash of gragas and J4 in the jungle, but they all get built tank in every scenario\n\nAlso sion is a frequent pick midlane as well\n\nTank supports dominate bot lane for the most part as well too, usually all you see is braum ali and tahm and morgana occasionally for poke lanes","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2018-04-24T19:43:15.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of all of the champions you've listed for the jungle. exactly one is a tank. . . \n\nMorgana and Tahm are catchers so you have 2 support tanks, 1 in jungle with Sej, and then Sion as the only tank in mid?  \n\nSo, 4 tanks are picked across 3 roles.

Manipulate waves better and stand on the side of the map closest to your jungler. Position yourself so that the assassin cannot effectively reach you and zone the assassin at the same time. If you are unable to zone the assassin (for example: hard counter or already behind) you should just focus on farming and juking skills anyways, and in which case you should not be complaining because a champion that is behind should not be able to contest one that is supposed to snowball when ahead. Stand by the wave so that the minions will aggro if the assassin tries to engage. Understand power curves of the assassin you are playing against. For example: Zed has weak pre 6 against most mages, then has a lot of kill pressure for the rest of laning phase unless playing against a counter, who slightly lowers his kill pressure. Talon has incredible level 2 and level 3, and will do a ton of damage early on, and slightly fall off later. If you still have a ton of trouble, don't be afraid to take resolve secondary, or grab a cloth armor/null magic mantle/extra starting item, or even ninja tabi/armguard/negatron cloak if applicable\n\nKeep in mind that assassins only stomp players who are bad at the game. If you don't respect their damage early, they lose their effectiveness and utility later. A good player (or team, if the assassin is a jungler) can completely shut down an assassin.

One thing is just enchanter supports not giving a fuck about how well any assassin plays, and another is a low elo/autofill kind of thing, where you can work hard and spread gold leads to your team, but your team doesn't get work done with said gold lead. Mages just flat out don't do much outside of their CC and safe dps, but assassins--we're the guys who do a bunch of shit and still lose anyways, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Jon 678910","date":"2018-04-23T14:32:42.616+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Going off this, assassins should be in a bad spot.

To a Nasus, every lane opponent is oppressive. Mages, compared to the early-mid powers of assassins, are not much better than Nasus. So just chill out and wait until teamfights, where you can be casting onto the enemy ranks non-stop while the assassin has to spin twenty thousand plates just to get themselves into the fight without exploding instantly.","replies":[{"poster":"Jon 678910","date":"2018-04-24T02:54:13.934+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand the point you're trying to make. It's obvious that assassins should be worse in teamfights than mages when they are better in duels. It's the exact same situation as fighters vs tanks in top lane. \n\nThe problem I was trying to raise is the reliability of assassin ultimates. Akali's ultimate is 3 point and click dashes. Diana's ultimate is a point and click dash. Zed's ultimate is a point and click blink. Katarina can literally shunpo and then ult a target. It's kinda hard to dodge skillshots when they're done at point blank range.\n\nI'll clarify that I have less of a problem with stuff like talon, ekko and fizz. I actually feel bad when I get hit by fizz ult, because I could have sidestepped it. Talon has a less reliable gap closer, meaning he has to play around terrain. Ekko's kit is telegraphed, through his W's delay and his ult clone.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LilBadWitch","date":"2018-04-23T04:53:45.423+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"Playing against Assassins is one of the most miserable laning experiences in League of Legends.

The other bad part of their design in general is how they snowball extremely hard off just building part of 1 item. Kat - LB hex, Yas Zeal, Fizz Sheen, and Kas any part of his roa, Zed his poachers.\n\nThe other annoying thing is that each of those champs have a ton of mobility and can easily dodge skill shots while also having no real resource management needed. Plus some of these champs even get shields or short CDs on their \"get out of jail free\" skill.\n\nRiot wants to nerf mages who can't even take towers nearly as fast as any other role ( minus the small exception like Azir as an example. ) They claim it's to help with the upcoming ADC changes, but that is just a stupid thought process to work off of. You want to nerf a role entirely so that you can then nerf another role after? How about putting in the QOL changes that ADCs need on their itemizations and ratios. How about just entirly doing away with crit finally or putting a cap on it? It's honestly not fun to watch an ADC \"skill\" or right click just to win a fight. There is literally no punishment to the role at this time because they are super safe with their items giving lots of mobility, boosted range, health, shields, aspd, on top of that stupid 1-2k crit dmg. It's time to admit there is a real problem and address it riot. Supports being able to actually protect their ADCs with a ton of utility is nice, but I agree I feel that when a fight comes up, no one else matters much except my adc. If I can keep my adc alive for just a few seconds and cc their adc, we win instantly. ( I got so sick of support the last 2 seasons I'm started going into JG and Mid more because everything is about just getting bot lane the win. )\n\nYou guys screwed up with the rune changes, adc itemization, sup itemization, and even some of the AP changes. You don't however go and nerf an entire role because the one you want to nerf is \"supposed to be nerfed\" after that. This just proves how biased the team is by making sure that the most played role they abuse is safe once their nerfs come around. Also, mages have been dominating mid forever as you claim, but yet most of the roster for mid laners is guess what, mages. That isn't the players fault there isn't more versatility being played mid except seeing adcs now starting to show up there. ( Which apparently is fine. )\n\nI never see complaints from the team on ADCs JGing, sitting mid, or even going top. Yet every other role is forced to go to one lane and only 1 lane. If a character even steps one inch out of line, they are actually getting rush nerfed that next patch. ADCs go patch after patch until finally getting hit. Ez, Varus, and Kog are prime examples of waiting patches just to get changes launched for them.\n\nIf Darius was going bot and dunking on people down there, I'm pretty sure he would be suddenly having adjustments being launched the very next patch to put him in his place.

Basically you want to pick someone that can either, shut them down early(Such as Malzahar or other Assassins that have better early games) or you'll pick someone who has a safe lane phase, good wave management and outscales them anyway. \n\nCounter's for Late Game Assassins: {{champion:13}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} and all Early Game Assassins. \n\nFizz, Zed and Katarina are Mid-Game assassins, their spike usually happens during Lane Phase and Continues into Mid-Game where they more often than not get fed due to lack of play around them. Unlike Kassadin and Yasuo, the actually have pretty strong early games but they fall off really hard late, so anyone that can lose lane and win the game, such as Yasuo or Kassadin are good same class counter's going into them but early game focused champions that are good at Roaming are really great to since you don't have to worry about their early game power at all and will scale better later anyway. \n\nCounter's for Mid-Game Assassins: {{champion:3}} (Match their Roams) {{champion:91}} (Your early game is stronger than all 3 of those champions.) {{champion:31}} (It's saucy but it works, silence+CC+true damage execute, they can't do anything.) {{champion:43}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} \n\nYou'll notice something, in both versions i listed Enchanter supports, the reason why is because they completely negate an Assassins damage if the assassin isn't already fed. Assassins unlike other classes rely heavily on getting ahead and staying ahead, to prevent them from doing that pick champions that farm well, scale well, out trade them or are just too tanky for them to deal with but these rules extend past Mid-Lane options. Chances are if you pick any of these champions. \n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:142}} \n\nYou'll probably end up against an assassin, and while you can take Exhaust, Barrier or Heal to prevent them from killing you easily your team needs to pick something to stop them in Mid-Game and Late-Game. If your team is full of squishies and has 0 CC or Healing, the assassin has a field day. So if you have the option and you pick after the assassin does, pick a counter to them if one doesn't already exist, trust me it'll make their life a living hell because you have just 1 counter. \n\nHonorable Mentions: {{champion:89}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:9}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2018-04-23T04:17:43.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":20,"body":"Do you play as an immobile mage?
