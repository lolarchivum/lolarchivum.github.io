This move, along with other components of the [NA Server Roadmap](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/WH8doH76-na-servers-and-the-future), should improve connection quality for the vast majority of NA players. West Coast players will see an uptick in raw ping numbers, but should also see that uptick mitigated by connection improvements in the form of better overall stability and reduced packet loss. We&rsquo;ll follow up the server move with a **weekend stress test** (complete with **Party IP**) from **August 28 - 30**. More details below.*\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nLast week, we [gave you guys a date](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/U0M1AVfO-na-server-roadmap-update-na-server-move-on-825), and now the time is upon us! From **~5 AM - Noon PDT** on **8/25**, the NA game servers will be moving to their new home in **Chicago, Illinois**.\n&nbsp;\n# What to expect\n\nAround 5 AM PDT on the 25th, we&rsquo;ll disable ranked play and kick off a phased, zero-downtime transfer of server activity, with an escalating percentage of game starts steadily re-allocated to Chicago over the course of the move. Keep in mind your game starts may hop back and forth between Chicago and Portland if you&rsquo;re playing during this period. By the end of the migration, all games will be supported out of Chicago, with Portland reverting to a disaster-recovery backup while we continue to gather data and make any required adjustments. **Tentatively**, we&rsquo;re shooting to complete the transfer by 12 PM (noon) PDT. \n&nbsp;\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PS8Hyxs.jpg\n&nbsp;\n\n# Things to look out for\n\nConsidering our extensive preparation and the lack of downtime, the most likely outcome is that you won&rsquo;t notice any disruption on your end, but we&rsquo;re also preparing for any and all contingencies. Worst case, we encounter significant issues and temporarily roll back to the current Portland servers so you encounter minimal downtime or disrupted play as we fix any major problems. Look for up-to-date info in the in-client ticker and [Service Status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/) page!\n\nGiven the complexity of NA&rsquo;s internet architecture and ISP landscape, we know we&rsquo;ll have to troubleshoot various local routing issues that crop up following the server move; we&rsquo;re already preparing to make sure your connections take the most efficient possible paths on our dedicated network to the new servers. Most connections will be already well-aligned by the time Chicago is live, but there will likely be at least some that aren&rsquo;t getting to Chicago as quickly as they could be. And we could use your help! Tomorrow,** look for our Chicago Connection Clinic Megathread** in which you guys will actually be able to help us troubleshoot any emergent network pathing problems by testing your connection to Chicago and sending us traceroute info from your machines. \n&nbsp;\n\n# ISP Peering: Cox, AT&T, Verizon\n\nOn a related note, **ISP peering** will of course play a major role in making sure your connections are getting to Chicago as quickly as possible. One of our key Roadmap efforts over the past year has been signing and maintaining agreements with ISPs across the US and Canada - check out our latest peering list [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap#h3). A note on some of the more high-profile names missing from that list: we&rsquo;re currently installing our connections with **Cox**, **AT&T**, and **Verizon**, and expect to have peering fully up and running with all three within a few weeks. If you&rsquo;re with one of these ISPs, your connection post-Chicago move may not be on the most efficiently routed path until that work completes. We&rsquo;ll keep you updated as these ISPs come online.\n&nbsp;\n\n#Transfers\n\nAs we&rsquo;ve mentioned, starting tomorrow, we&#039;ll also offer free transfers to players located in the US, US territories, and Canada who are currently playing on other servers - look for a transfer email from us and a free transfer option in the store on your account! Lingering questions about transferring your account? Check out our [Account Transfer FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751924-Account-Transfer-FAQ).\n&nbsp;\n\n#Stress Test Weekend\n\nAfter the move itself has been successfully completed, we want to roll right into a **stress test weekend** from **August 28 - 30** to observe how well the new game servers handle peak traffic. To help make sure we really put the new Chicago infrastructure through its paces, we&rsquo;re enabling **Party IP** over the weekend - check out the details below in case you need a refresher.\n\n**Number of players in party  -->  Bonus IP awarded**\n\n* 2  -->  100% bonus\n\n* 3  -->  150% bonus\n \n* 4  -->  200% bonus\n\n* 5  -->  300% bonus\n\nYou earn rewards win or lose, but only if you&rsquo;re in a party with at least one other player. Make sure to log in, help us test, and earn extra IP from **August 28th, 00:00 PDT** through **August 30th, 23:59 PDT!**\n\n-----\n\nWe&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow with up-to-date info on the progress and outcome of the move, ~~but in the meantime we&rsquo;re also happy to address any immediate questions you may have in the comments below!~~ thanks everyone for your questions! We'll be live tomorrow with additional information during the transition.\n\nGoing to archive this thread now that the Chicago servers are fully online! Details and discussion should be [directed over to this updated post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/2uTrAyy8-na-server-roadmap-update-chicago-server-move-complete).

Everyone in one game is on one server. Say, when you queue up for a ranked game, you don't know which server it will be hosted on. You could have 20 ping, or 120 ping. No one wants to have to deal with unexpected lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Emperor Cynric","date":"2015-08-24T21:11:10.370+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":31,"body":"I always spike from 50-900 ping in game on average and I live in freaking nor cal. its not my internet ive run the tests and it runs fine. so its riots fault for this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lolibam","date":"2015-08-24T23:59:34.959+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remember the ping distribution map they showed at an earlier date?  That was based on the data coming directly from the Riot server itself.  If you are getting that ping when you're that close then the problem's on your side.  When you run the speed tests on your side it measures the incoming and outgoing data just from the local infrastructure based on your internet service provider.  Those tests by no means are enough to show how your local infrastructure will interact with anything outside of its own network much less the data coming from a different source entirely. I live in east Texas and I get 60-90 ping.  Location is not the only factor that determines ping please do more research before blatantly blaming a gaming company that already does more for its player base than most companies can ever hope for.  \n\n50-900 ping spikes? that's definitely on your side but the problem may not necessarily be coming directly from your router and in all honesty you're right in that it probably isn't your fault.  It could be something out of your control but that doesn't mean that Rito can control it either.  It could be a variation in paths and hubs that the data takes before its received by your computer.  The main reason why Rito was moving its servers (as stated by them) was because Chicago has a much better network infrastructure, which means that data theoretically would be able to take more direct paths to more people and by doing so would decrease the amount of data transfers needed to get information to where it needs to be.  Sure its position in the middle of the country helps but the physical location of the server only matters to a certain extent there's much more to it than that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-08-24T19:04:29.549+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":28,"body":"I'm sorry brother.

I will have better ping than the East Coast has had by _a little_. Look at a map. Draw a line from Chicago to New York, and then draw a line from Chicago to San Diego. Now for fun, draw a line from Portland to New York. If you measure those lines, you'll find that the length of the Chicago->San Diego line is closer to the Portland->New York line than it is to the Chicago->New York line. In other words, it almost might as well be in New York. That move would make my ping increase less than the move to Chicago.","replies":[{"poster":"Soraxor","date":"2015-08-24T19:43:56.936+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":8,"body":"From the perspective of an East Coaster, you can shove your \"little more ping\" right up there and deal with it.\nDraw a line from the East coast to the West coast, and then draw a line from the West coast to the West coast.

The Chicago servers are clearly better for EVERYONE in NA, screw favoring the West over the East, and any \"compensation.\" \nRiot is balancing out the ping so instead of West/Middle/East = Great/Average/Poor ping, now from West/Middle/East the ping is Average/Great/Average.
