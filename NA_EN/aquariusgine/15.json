There was even a thread saying it seemed unfair to play immobile champions now because of her rework and the moment the rework was released, the amount of frustration against her was sky high (i mean it's no surprise since she is a champ designed by certainlyt, but I can't talk about him).\nHer identity has been ruined. An assassin champion but played in a bruiser way. That's not even how assassins work ffs.\n\nNote: this is before the nerfs and removal.\nAkali is the only champion I know with like 8 mechanical functions in just her passive and Q in total. A slow, a heal, a movement speed buff, another movement speed buff, ranged auto, an empowered auto, energy restoration, aoe, and double ap and ad scaling. Note that all those can be enhanced with Hextech Gunblade.\n\nHer W is probably the most toxic ability in the history of toxic abilities and simply because of one thing. True stealth. Like wtf is that? Oh so hiding under tower is now illegal? Is playing safe now a reportable offense? The fact that it hid you even under turret was the most hated and main core of frustration on Akali and riot took them exactly 8 months to remove it. 8 MONTHS! Yes, I counted.\n\nHer E my only critic is that why does it have to be something used as an escape and also as a gap closer? Oh I mess up? I can escape. Oh you're low? If I hit you with e, there is literally no escape.\n\nHer R since it could scale with both ad and ap (which again idk why this is a thing), had a freaken stun because why not, and even had 2 charges was something that was just pure bullshit.\n\nEVEN after a ton of nerfs, a ton of removal of mechanics, Akali still remains an overloaded champion and yet apparently still seen in pro play? (I don't watch pro play but I was told she had presence this year too).\n\nThis champion was a very toxic champion to the point that she even made the players toxic.\nI mean, I saw a freaken thread of some guy who literally reports every Akali player whether they are on his team or enemy team. Reason? Simply for playing that champion. Nothing else.

Darius may seem oppressive to people who don't know how to play, but pair him against any competent riven, irelia, akali, and you just get shit on. If you pick him against like shen or cho, they just play safe and scale better for team fights or map presence. If you pick him against Camille, she can either just wear you down with quick short trades, or roam and get fed if she's not picking you off. Jax can beat darius early or play safe to scale if he needs to, same with tryn. Yeah, I'd say darius is pretty shit against most players with a brain, because he doesn't have enough burst or dps pre-five stacks, and with zero mobility or shields, a long cooldown pull, and a super low mana pool, other champs can just dodge and harass the shit out of him. Eventually he'll go oom and not be able to do anything but auto, or they simply all-in him with superior damage, mobility and cc, basically face tank him, and win (riven lolz). I mean, it's not hard for most of those champs do dodge his Q. His Q has the most counterplay of almost any ability in the game, and those champs are all geared towards taking advantage of the counterplay of other champs, while being near immune to being punished themselves (with the exceptions of shen and cho of course)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2019-11-12T10:44:51.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"true, but it can be fixed if riot wakes up and nerf/reduces it\n\nwhen they gave her compensation buffs, they buffed the passive movement speedwhich was a bad idea imo","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2019-11-12T05:32:33.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She went from being a stat-checking 1-shotter to whatever the fuck she is now.\n\nRiot accomplished their goal, i guess","replies":[]},{"poster":"Probs feeding","date":"2019-11-12T04:31:14.394+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its no better than old Akali, which was literally a low-interactive stat check every time you fought her.\n\nAt least she looks cool now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2019-11-12T13:30:21.483+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since they intentionally designed and balanced her to be broken, no, it did not fail.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2019-11-12T13:18:02.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is she balanced?

IMO, she double dips in the rewards of too many tools. And I'm not ashamed to say, I have no respect for the updated akali mains.

Wanna know why?\nBecause riot made a fuck ton of money selling skins for her, when she was broken. After her rework akali skins sales sky rocketed and riot made money off of it. Nobody quit playing because of Akali. Does riot give a shit that pre-rework Akali was literally deleted from the game and replaced with this unbalanceable piece of garbage? NOPE!\nBottom line is riot doesn't care about YOU, riot doesn't care about player frustration and balance. They care about money. And as long as releasing Anime girls and overly complex unbalance-able certainlyT-esq kits makes them money they are gonna keep doing it.","replies":[]}]}
