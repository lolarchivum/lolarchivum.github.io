He's just the same joke over and over.  He's supposed to be about protecting people and compassion.  But we don't see that in his lore or his dialogue.  Yes, he can have a few jokes, yes he can have some over the top aspects to him (hell, Braum is very over the top, but done right).  What you should look for in Taric, is honor, prudence, valor, determination, and a strong compassion.  Build him up on those aspects, and you'll build his character.  His gem fetish (cause that's what it is right now to the community) is a joke, not a humanizing quality.  He's supposed to draw power and magic from them, not be fixated on them.\n\nSo, let Taric be quirky, knightly, and proud.  If you make him funny, that's fine.  But give him a reason to be funny.  If you want him to be effeminate, outrageous, and flashy... then you're missing out on who you already have.  Don't make him into a Yumichika or Charlotte Chuhlhourne from Bleach, make him into Dordoni Alessandro Del Socaccio.

Where champions blended serious themes and abilities with just the slightest brush of silliness and absurdity. You can still see this in old champions who haven't been revamped (Shaco, Alistar, Corki, Teemo), where they come across as heroic or powerful most of the times, but what also shines through are the little quirks in their personalities that make them uniquely unique.\n\nTaric has this quality right now. He's heavily grounded in a paladin archetype, with his armor, shield, willingness to protect allies, and of course being SaF (Suave as Fruitloops). But that's not who Taric *is*, he has this grand over the top flamboyantly badass quality to him that really defines him as being Taric. \n\nAny rework that attempts to update Taric should keep this in mind, Taric has a legacy and that's about all he has left now, so don't take that away, pretty please.\n\nEDIT: I realized I was a bit vague on how this connected with the image OP put up. Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful artwork, and if this was used as inspiration to update Taric, that'd be wonderful. The style of the artwork gives off the impression though that he's far too serious, which is something Taric should never be.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirage Night","date":"2014-08-08T09:01:58.137+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think with a little more \"Outrageousness\", it could turn into something fantastic.

Do *they* let him stun people? What is his W about? Is that ice or... gems? \n\nTaric just has no definite character or fleshed-out central idea to him. He's completely devoid of identity outside of being a walking joke. His kit is just *stuff*. A heal, a stun, an armor buff that can do AoE damage, and an unexciting ult that gives a power aura. If you put that next to, say, Sona or Thresh, you begin to see just how flat and lifeless Taric really is. \n\nWhen I think of Taric, I don't think of a paladin (paladins are holy men, and Taric's heal is just generic green, and nothing else about him screams \"holy\"), and I don't even think of a compassionate or selfless knight.

He needs to have room for humor, since many of his quirks are a rather pleasant contrast to other more somber champions, but that doesn't mean he should be without his own badassery. I think a lot of people want to play a true paladin character without feeling like they're just the butt of every joke. I mean, the whole \"Ooh, Taric/Ez in bot lane brush, how scaaAAAaaAAAndalous~*~\" joke is just tired at this point.\n\nGive us a heroic and badass paladin, but let him be pretty and flirtatious when he's not dismantling his enemies and rallying his allies.

It's a very tricky argument to make with Taric from a personal sense: people either love the fact that he's a joke character or hate it, and it's certainly going to be a challenge to really try and please both crowds.\n\nDespite my empathy for preserving as much of the old league as we can, however, I have to side with giving Taric at least a *little* of a personality upgrade. Let's ask some honest questions here. How many League players in general, for instance, know Taric says this:\n\n*\"Malphite, never bring a rock to a gem fight.\"*\n\nI'm gonna be honest; I myself didn't know he had a special Malphite taunt until I just looked it up on the wiki, and I used to main Taric as a support. Now, how many League players in general know that Taric says *this*:\n\n*\"Gems? Gems are truly outrageous. They are truly, truly, truly outrageous.\"*\n\nHonestly, I do believe that at least some of Taric's slightly flamboyant flair should remain in tact. It's part of his personality, one of the only things that keeps him unique in League right now, IMO. However, it's probably time to shore up some of the excess. Honestly, unless he gets some sort of in-depth lore and mechanics remake, he will continue to be the butt of the internet's jokes and will fade into obscurity like Urgot and Poppy seem to have done.\n\nAlso, for those who might be interested, please check out my champion concept: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/BxIn84WU-champion-concept-valruk-the-jungles-revenge","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyrus Blackmoon","date":"2014-08-08T14:34:37.752+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like serious Taric.
