I've been playing League off and on since Season 1, and never have a seen a champion that infuriates me so much.  What's worse is that she's not even highly picked either, which makes banning her every game to avoid her even worse, because it's like wasting a ban.\n\nZoe has exceptionally high mobility, extremely long range, one of the longest crowd control effects in the game, and she can actually reuse SUMMONER SPELLS repeatedly off her W by storing them and then picking up new ones in a fight.  She's got exceptionally high burst, can deal true damage without needing to hit you herself, and generally just has a playstyle that is incredibly frustrating.\n\nI'm not trying to say that she is broken, or overpowered, or anything of the sort.  But she has a specific kit that can entirely shut down and eliminate specific characters from being able to actually play the game, and she requires a specific counter to her.  That's something Riot said they were wanting to move away from, massive hard counters, and that's really sad that Zoe just flat up violates that while being able to nearly one shot players.  It's like someone saw the old spear from Nidalee's kit and said \"You know what, I'd love if this was a longer range, harder to dodge, and dealt more damage.  Oh, and add a 2.75 second crowd control at range that does true damage on there.  Perfect.\n\nI'm actually so frustrated and unhappy with this champion that I'm considering quitting League because of it.  It shows the most extreme issue with a game that's constantly evolving, when something comes out that breaks the play experience this badly for someone, they can't go back to playing the game before that broken piece was introduced.  I just have to sit here and wait for Zoe to either get a rework, or start being absurdly unhappy and frustrated with the game because of it.  That's NOT a good thing.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2018-12-15T05:05:21.545+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"She really doesn't have high mobility. She can teleport, yes, but it doesn't actually serve as an escape. It's mostly used to extend the range of her Q or get a cheeky angle for her E. \n\nHer E does true damage, yes, but only as an echo of the initial damage dealt, which WAS reduced by your MR and damage resistances. Your resistances definitely come into play with her E, but it doesn't compound that resistance for the extra damage amp. \n\nShe's definitely frustrating to play against, but she's not any more oppressive than, say, Ahri. Ahri does more damage, does \"actual\" true damage with her Q, her Charm amps damage and doesn't have a delay before you're CC'd, her main damage tools aren't blocked by minions, and to top it all off she has actual mobility that lets her get it to deal damage or get out of a bad situation. \n\nIf the jungler camps Zoe's lane, she becomes useless. She has no escape from a gank and her damage is very low at point-blank range. She needs space to move and redirect her star to deal good damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiƒter","date":"2018-12-15T05:08:01.589+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"This.\n\n\nI'd rather fight a Zoe than a damn Ahri.

I can dodge Ahri's charm, she has to get into a similar range as other champions, Ahri might have lots of mobility, but she's going to have to get into range at some point.  There's a radius or range that all champions in the game play at, Zoe is the ONLY champion in the game that gets to play at a much further distance than anyone else.  I can't just wait for Zoe to pop into range and throw cc on her, because her ultimate will still pull her away even when I do.  But if Ahri goes in with her ultimate I can stun/root/silence her which means she's not going anywhere for that entire time.\n\nAnd what does space have to do with anything?  Ok, the jungler spends his ENTIRE time sitting on a lane that never has to leave her turret because she can literally have full control of the lane from that distance.  Your arguments are that Zoe has the same weakness as every midlaner, but only to the jungle.  Her kit is literally a negative play experience, because she plays the game at a different range than everyone else and there's almost zero risk required on her part.  The only risk is if she can't hit her abilities, she won't do damage, but that's a risk inherent to all champions.  Nothing forces Zoe to have to engage, nothing makes her have to get out of position, nothing requires her to have to do anything at all.  Which makes her doubly frustrating in game modes where the normal laning doesn't work the same way like Nexus Blitz.\n\nAnd before you even say anything about it, it IS a game mode, it DOES deserve to be balanced, and they've already made balance changes, buffing Zoe which I find absolutely stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2018-12-15T05:49:24.384+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Zoe is an artillery champion, and she's not the only one. Champions like Ziggs, Lux, Xerath, Vel'Koz, and Jayce can sit really far back and deal pretty consistent damage to their enemy. Having long range spells isn't unique to Zoe. \n\nIf Zoe just sits under tower and spams Q at the wave, she won't really get anything done. If you're there pushing with autos, you'll eventually push the wave into the tower. She can certainly deal damage from under tower, but it's not enough to totally outshove you unless you aren't touching the wave. She'll eventually run out of mana trying to shove from under turret. \n\nThe counter to Zoe isn't to CC her when she jumps in. She isn't an assassin. She's a mage. You need to jump on her original position where she will have no escape other than a single-target CC on a long cooldown. If she already used that, she's toast. You engage on her so that her range is useless. \n\nIf you can dodge Ahri's Charm, you can dodge Zoe's Sleep.

If you want to try doing that, go somewhere else, because the only truth here is that Zoe is annoying frustrating and unfun for me to play against, none of the other champions are.\n\nI never am in a game asking \"where is the Ziggs/Vel'Koz/etc that just killed me out of nowhere and how can I find them and kill them.?\"  I literally will die out of nowhere from a single hit from Zoe with no idea it was coming, and there's almost no way to get to her on the backline because she's that much further away than anyone else, and she can protect herself too.  Even if I wanted to flash on her, she can just pick up my long cooldown flash and use her w and get away easily.  It's absurd because none of the other \"artillery\" champions have that kind of mobility.  They are all low movespeed no dash stationary targets.  Zoe is the only high movespeed non-stationary with the ability to utilize the power of summoner spells on an ability slot, and has a dash, which while not an escape, provides her with the ability to heavily disrupt attempts to shut her down.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-12-16T06:18:28.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for openly admitting you don't want to have a real discussion in your thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2018-12-16T06:52:09.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's about my feedback on the champion, if you just came here to insult me and talk about how the champion isn't imbalanced, then you didn't bother to read the thread, and therefor you aren't actually here to discuss anything to begin with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FemalesAreLesser","date":"2018-12-16T01:13:02.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:101}} *cough Range cough*","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2018-12-16T06:16:27.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who has to essentially root himself in place while he charges up to get that range, instead of being able to run around freely independent of his spell.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-12-16T06:23:01.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Who has to essentially root himself in place while he charges up to get that range\n\nHuh, just like Zoe does with her R...","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2018-12-16T06:54:08.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's not even remotely the same thing.
