I find it very strange that mages and marksmen both receive powerful counters to crowd control (Banshee's Veil and Mercurial Scimitar), and even supports get to access Mikael's Crucible as an extra cleanse for the marksman, yet tanky classes, who are the most exposed to CC and often in greatest need of resisting it, have no such dedicated effect.\n\nTo a larger degree, I think CC in League might need a pass in how it's applied, as I feel there's too much crowd control in the game, and too much of it has very little counterplay against enemies in melee range. Morgana's Q, for example, is really interactive against a ranged opponent, who can see it coming and move out of the way, but offers nothing of the sort to melee enemies, who get caught instantly in a 3-second root. Tanks and juggernauts get a bad rap for having kits that punish enemies simply for being near them, yet that is the same problem that affects a whole bunch of abilities, especially skillshots.\n\nA lot of the game's counterplay feels like it presumes that interactions happens between two ranged opponents at some distance from each other, and doesn't at all account for how melee champions end up dealing with those effects. Giving melee champions better tools to deal with abilities and CC could help mitigate the issue, but the only way to solve it is going to be by making sure each champion remains interactive even when in melee range of their opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"CithriaC","date":"2017-08-08T08:01:23.058+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to invalidate or counter your point- imagine that item on Yi or even a rare Kayle.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-08-08T14:32:10.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For sure, that is _exactly_ the kind of abuse case I'd want to avoid.
