The direction of Mordekaiser!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":38,"down_votes":12,"body":"Well first off a big &quot;thank you&quot; coming from my cold metal Hueart.\nThe current PBE cycle&#039;s the first glimmer of hope for Mordekaiser on the gameplay front and I&#039;d like to seize this opportunity to get down to business and contemplate on which direction Mordekaiser should be guided towards.\n\nTo do this I&#039;ll just present some of my ideas on how to tweak his current kit and offer my insight on why I think they should be considered.\nStill, I&#039;m no gameplay expert by any means but a Metal-maniac, soon...\n\n**IRON MAN**\nReal talk? I hated the change putting his shield gen from 35% down to 25% but with the changes to his Siphon I&#039;m actually quite happy with his passive.\nNothin&#039; worth changing here except maybe not making it decay during combat but decay at a higher rate outside of it (2% base health perhaps?)\n\n**Mace of Spades**\nLet&#039;s be honest. His third Q is satisfying but that&#039;s about it. It lacks counterplay if he flashes on top of you and it takes up way too much of his damage budget.\n\nI like the direction of his Q proposed on the PBE but rather than making his third Q hold most of his damage I&#039;d like to propose the following;\n\n-&gt;Mace of Spades empowers Mordekaiser&#039;s next three basic attacks, adding a magic damage component.\n-&gt;No longer doubles the third strike&#039;s damage.\n-&gt;Each of the three hits deal 100+110%AD+80%AP for a total of; 300+330%AD+240% AP.\nThe damage is even lower than the current PBE one but it gives him consistent Damage on each hit. No more insta bursting!\nYet, for Morde to remain a threat beyond his third Q he has to be able to put out constant damage so how about we borrow from Hecarim&#039;s Q and add a stacking buff towards Morde&#039;s Q, reducing his Mace of Spades&#039; cool down by 1-2 depending on the stacks he gathered.\nThis would make him a threat in prolonged fights since he&#039;d be smacking his enemies 24/7 with his mace of spades.\nThe stacks would also increase his health costs to even things out a bit.\n\nThis change would make him less oppressive with his third Q and give him ways to continue building up shield and dish out damage once he&#039;s in the fray.\n\n**Harvester of Sorrow**\nWelp, Solo casting for the DoT would be nice. Period.\n\nI&#039;d even go as far as to suggest the removal of the heal in favor of a bit more UMF for his W :9\n\n**Siphon of Destruction**\nI&#039;m pretty satisfied with this one actually.\nIt was overbearing pre-rework due to its high base damage and spammability.\nIt now functions as Mordekaiser&#039;s Shield Generator tool, making it his bread and butter ability  for fighting his foes.\n\n**Children of the Grave**\nAs much as I miss the old range (850 range ftw!) Morde should be kept as a close-range damage threat rather than a long range nuker.\n\n**Base stats!:**\nMordekaiser&#039;s base stats are something worth looking at, being really low and not exactly helping him get the job done.\n\nMovement Speed; Buffing his MS up to 335 would be only fair after the nerfs to Trinity force and reducing his attack range to 175. Besides, he&#039;s the only juggernaut without any Mobility/CC and most of his hombres got MS upwards to 345.\n\nAttack Speed; His AS being low was a great way to ensure he wouldn&#039;t just smack his enemies with his third Q too quickly.\nBut with the proposed changes one could consider buffing his AS per level to make him able to get off his Q&#039;s more often in the late game where every second counts.\n\nBase Armor; 20 base armor... Ehh.... He might need a tad more armor but I&#039;d actually be fine with his armor per level being beefed up instead.\n\nBase Health; 525+73/level. Maxing out at 1765. Really, really, really low for a Juggernaut. Especially compared to Darius, Illai and Gren all of which have over 2100.\n-&gt;Health per level 73-&gt;83. This would make him max out at 1900ish without buffing his early all that much.\n\nI hope you&#039;ve noticed a pattern here;\nMorde should scale a lot better with levels to become this Lategame Monster and to make use of his *shudders* W passive.\nNot only this but his beefed up base stats would help him survive longer in fights and get his Q&#039;s off.\nWith my proposed Q changes he&#039;d need to stick around to deal his damage so these changes should be reasonable.\n\n\n**Riot&#039;s Agenda?**\nMeddler once mentioned they wanted Morde to become more of a consistent damage bruiser that just refused to die with his Iron Man passive and less of a burst champion that completely obliterates you in the fragment of a second. \nWith his Q being similar to hecarim&#039;s he&#039;d be able to put out great sustained damage, filling his shield 24/7 and get rewarded for STAYING in melee range to destroy the opposition rather than just getting ONE empowered Q off to completely vaporize the unlucky enemy.\n\nStill, this is only my opinion. We all have different visions of the Master of Metal, The IRON REVENANT.\nStill, the fact that there are Mordekaiser changes on the PBE pleases me greatly and I&#039;m anxious to know Riot&#039;s plans regarding Mordekaiser and how he&#039;ll finally become a healthy addition to the game, making most Morde fans happy :)\n\n~M.M\n\nhttp://pre07.deviantart.net/6fd0/th/pre/i/2013/149/d/f/mordekaiser_and_rigby_by_dand01-d671trd.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-15T19:46:43.725+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"A dream I have about Morde is for him to have inbuilt Tenacity (on his Shield maybe?) so that instead of CC mobility becomes his counter.
