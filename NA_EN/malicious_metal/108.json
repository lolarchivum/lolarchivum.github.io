I thought that all of these would be gameplay bugs that impact him in a significant way. The vast majority of these are basically his ghost being buggy with passives and animation or sounds not playing correctly. The way you and other players made it sound it is presented it as if he had 160+ direct gameplay bugs which is kind of disingenuous like #9 is literally saying his Q doesnt do a 1 /2 /3 anymore. This needs to be separated to show actual gameplay bugs animation and sound bugs and ghost specific bugs. There are definitely a hell of a lot of gameplay bugs thats for sure but the way it's presented just upsets me. Like number 34 isnt a bug at all it's just a statement that he has a passive he cant use on aram. quite a few champs have useless things on aram.\n\nEdit: You could cut this number down by over 40 hell I'd be willing to waver even cut it in half just by stating that his ghost isn't applying passives correctly. Listing every single champion passive is just fluff. The W E and Q bugs were eye opening. Also some of these could be undocumented changes that happened when they patched him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"N Komaeda","date":"2017-01-10T21:31:19.354+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel Morde's greatest weakness is his melee power **without** a gapcloser.\n\nA lot of chimps nowadays have insane dueling power with a gap closer.
