I&#039;ve never seen anything like it. To the extent of why you are trash by no means can be put into 1 picture, but here is just one picture of it. This will also be most likely censored and taken down because you hate facing facts. Just another reason your company is absolute garbage. Not a single other company would do this, and if they are actual businesses not online, they aren&#039;t even allowed to, because they have a government keeping them from being a piece of shit that your company has turned into.\r\n\r\nPrecursor,\r\nI&#039;ve never been chat restricted, I&#039;ve never been banned, I know for a fact that this is nothing but abuse.\r\n\r\nEarlier today I was playing the game where all 4 players on my team were harassing me from the start. Their only intention was to troll me. My support was csing my lane. My entire team was purposely and intentionally just trying to attack me, verbally, and in game. BUT LUCKY FOR ME I HAVE RIOT RIGHT?? If I was a piece of shit trying to specifically to ruin their experience, then yep, Riot would be on my side.\r\n\r\nThe best part about this is that they have literally no reason for my 14 day ban.\r\n\r\nThis is why nobody take&#039;s Riot serious. This is why, their game will and continue to be the worst community of all time. This is why anything dealing with e-sports has been given a bad rep. This is why I never support any major function for anything dealing with riot, because they do not put the player first and never intend to. And I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever talked to anyone that hasn&#039;t said &quot;Before I was banned&quot; EXCEPT the worst fucking people I&#039;ve ever seen online at all. ESPECIALLY forum trolls in the player behavior forums. They just still think their system is flawless somehow. These people are legit nut jobs. How can you seriously think your system works AT ALL? Absolutely terrible company. Somebody in their management needs to wake up and actually do something about this, because all that&#039;s going to happen is these low life riot workers are just going to assert their power around like they already do and oppress anyone with an opinion against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2018-01-19T16:25:29.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nThis thread has gone on for a while and seems to have spun off into various arguments and disagreements while the OP seems to have stopped posting regarding his ban.

If they dont want someone to play the game, either because he broke the ToU or they have a reason that they dont want to reveal, they can ban you and you can do nothing about it. Also, the account you play with, along with everyone else's account, is not yours, per se, its RIOT's property. They have simply given you permission to use it. So they have complete authority over it. And, unless they permanently banned a specific person, what was banned is the account, not you. Also, regarding the \"massive\" amount of money you have \"given\" them. You dont actually buy their product. You pay for the ability to use digital contact, you dont own the skins or whatever you bought, you just payed for the ability to use them. And, as a digital content, the one who actually owns the rights for it can forbid you from using them at any time. They dont actually steal from you.\n\nBut, honestly, do you really think a company that makes millions would really care about a random person's $500? What is a lot of money for you, its close to nothing for them. You should understand, though i doubt it, that they have complete authority over their game and you can do absolutely nothing to them, law wont even be on your side. You see, contracts between individuals, parties or companies are above the law. So, even if they were actually stealing from you by banning you, since you agreed to that when signing their contract, even the law can do anything for you.","replies":[{"poster":"DBS Ronovon","date":"2018-01-17T09:29:46.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Pyramid schemes are illegal, even though people are willing to participate in them, how does that work?","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-01-17T11:20:34.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because pyramid schemes work by making people believe they can get profits that are in reality not even obtainable in the slightest.

Your access to the account that you never actually paid for and that is still Riot's, however, is not. And given that you are only allowed to use the account as long as you abide by Riot's terms of use, you are shit out of luck if you don't and lose your access to the account which never was yours and which was explicitely **said** to not be yours.\n\nLet's say a friend allows you to live in an appartment for free but discloses certain rules you need to follow for as long as you live there.\nYou acknowledge and agree to the rules.\nBecause he's also good with paint and you like the color green, you give him money so he can paint **his** appartment green.\nYou then proceed to break the rules and he subsequently kicks you out.\n\nDo you think that in this scenario you would have any way of getting back the money you paid for having the room painted?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-01-19T08:37:44.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DBS Ronovon,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aVnL5q60,comment-id=000a0002000000000000000200000002000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-01-19T08:29:58.611+0000)\n>\n> When you pay money for a product\n\nYou don't. That's the point that the ToS clarifies. You can't purchase one thing and then get upset about not getting the thing you thought you were purchasing.\n\nWhat you are doing is the equivalent of buying a ticket for the cinema and then get upset that you didn't get the DVD of the movie.\n\n>if the ToS say you don't actually get anything for the money you spend, that is stealing, which is illegal.\n\nYou are getting something. You just don't get any ownership over anything. Just like with millions of other real life examples. Or do you legally own your gardener just because you pay him? What about the aforementioned cinema ticket? What about renting an appartment?\nAre all of these \"stealing\"?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-01-18T19:59:54.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's called a contract and you signed it, by hitting accept.
