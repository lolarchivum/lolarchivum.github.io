It wouldn't have to be a skill with 100% 'grey damage', it could do part temporary and part real. \n\n2. Another option (that I like a lot better) is a champion who after a basic combo could choose between: \n(a) A high damage finisher that does a bunch more 'grey damage'\n(b) A low damage trading option that 'procs' the temporary damage to make it stick. \n\nI appreciate all the feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-07-20T20:38:03.966+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"That doesnt sound fun to use at all.\n\nYou are effectively creating an execute, that is all it is.

I think this is a great idea. \n\nIf you want to execute someone, go ahead. If your team is going after an enemy, and you're almost dead, you don't want to stick around, but the \"damage\" would be enough for your team to get the kill before the time is up\n\nIt might even cause the enemy to start running back to turret (because they think they'll die) allowing for free aa's ad other spells, so when they heal back up from your -shield, they still have to back.\n\nAll in all, this could be used in a lot of great ways.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-07-20T21:29:26.677+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Darius' ult has an execute mechanic, it isnt tied to being an execute.\n\nGaren's ult has a base damage and scales on missing health.\n\nRiven's ult has increased range and massive damage boost tied to it.\n\nNotice something about these 3 skills?

Sure, damage that doesn't stay for more than 6 seconds or so wouldn't feel great, but you could bait heals with it, it could help you win a fight or force a back, it could help you leash the jungler, and sure - you could even use it as an execute.
