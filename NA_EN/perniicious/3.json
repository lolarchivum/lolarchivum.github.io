Simply due to it's static nature.\n\nIf Windwall were to be on a ranged champion who could afford to sit behind it, it would be fine as it's main defensive tool, but Yasuo needs to go through it quite often. Windwall is a great ability, despite being really infuriating to deal with, but it's not enough for the squishiest (at least stat wise) melee champion. A melee hyper-carry needs a few things to be truly effective:\n\n- A Damage Steroid\n- Item-Kit Synergy that implies heavy Auto Attack reliance\n- A kit that affords them to build pure offensive items\n\nWindwall, strictly speaking, is not enough to afford Yas to build glass cannon, just like Meditation is not enough to allow Yi to ignore defensive items.\n\nFlow, if anything else, is an interactive way of giving Yasuo some tankiness. While it requires little skill by the Yasuo player, it still offer it's opponents a way to deal with it by poking him with an auto attack and waiting it out before engaging. It's a much more interactive option than sheer stats would ever be, or a binary option such as Nasus' Life Steal Passive, in which he either gets to AA freely and heal anything, or he's bullied and has effectively no passive at all.\n\nPersonally, I dislike Yasuo as a character, and depending on the match-up he may get to be an extreme annoyance (specially in the late game).

The new IE just means he doesn't have to build it anymore and can focus on other items instead... I get that his passive makes his crits weaker but couldn't they just tune that number based on the fact you can't increase crit damage with an item anymore?

When the meta/itemization shifts for him, however, he gets instantly buffed to compensate. \n\nThe issue here isn't so much that he's getting the buffs, it's that Riot seems to give him way more attention than a lot of forgotten champs with far less polarizing designs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Add92","date":"2018-06-07T22:33:54.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because a rioter is a Yasuo main so God forbid his champ is nerfed too bad","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2018-06-08T06:51:31.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"every champ probably has a rioter main.","replies":[]}]}]}
