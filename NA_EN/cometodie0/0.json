You were warned in your previous penalty that the next time would result in a permanent ban.\n\n> where i wasnt really flaming extremely or insulting anyone’s person but rather defending myself against their sulk on how\n\nYou were literally the first person to type in that game, and it was a harassing statement. You then continued to harass people, not 'defend yourself' as you claim. Not that it would be an excuse in any case.\n\n> i reached d4 with 63% winrate and was recieving at least 2 honors per game i dont understand why did that 1 game deserve my account to be completely erased ?\n\nBecause you've had previous penalties recently, and told the next would be a perma-ban. How many warnings do you think you should get? \n\nIf you'd like further clarity you an post the chat logs for the community to give you feedback, or I can post them for you if you'd like me to.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-08-24T18:47:49.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a really, really late smite, but we'll take it!\n\n{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ComeToDie0","date":"2018-08-25T04:39:56.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour-en/GQ9Uw1QK-perma-ban-for-one-game-with-mild-toxicity-but-too-much-arguing \nmade a mistake and copied a wrong page, sorry for not finding out until now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ComeToDie0","date":"2018-08-25T04:45:49.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"also how did i start harassing j4 ? by asking him to follow kata and telling him he has no pressure and doesnt exist compared to her ? that's literally gameplay discussion if u truly think that is harassment i think it's hopeless to even discuss anything with u.\npost his response to me and compare them with each other then tell me who was being really rude and harassing the other.\ni dare u post his chat log next to mine and see who was harassing who but i doubt you'll do it cuz then you'll have to ban him too ;)\nif everyone cant handle criticism in a competitive team game and cant stand anyone saying anything to him calling something that stupid and simple harassment, then i suggest u leave the game instead of banning everyone u dont like because u cant take the stick out of ur buttocks , cuz ass is toxic :o","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-08-24T15:59:56.714+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you truly wish to discuss your ban then post your entire unedited Reform Card here in this thread.
