The best &quot;ADC&quot; is a mage.  AP Carry mage &quot;supports&quot; taking over bot lane. The only role they aren&#039;t viable is Jungle and even then you have Ivern.\r\n\r\nThen you get people throwing a huge fit over the Lethality buff when **it was barely a buff at all**. Legit every single champ that does well with the lethality builds was doing great last patch too. And its ***still*** a straight up nerf to what flat armor pen was last season.\r\n\r\nBut hey! It &quot;broke&quot; certain champs right? Lets take a look at the biggest abuser {{champion:21}}. MF is sitting on a 53.3% win rate. Now lets take a look at her winrate last patch, before the buff. **53.0%**. My lord! An entire 0.3%! Obviously its a problem with the mechanic and not the champions themselves! Kha isn&#039;t overtuned, lethality is! Jayce totally was roflstomping the entire top lane meta for months straight before the lethality changes!\r\n\r\nPeople throwing a fit over {{item:3036}} ignoring **BONUS** armor when you still have {{item:3135}} ignoring **TOTAL** Magic Resist (looking at you squishies). Someone explain to me how one is broken and not the other? Explain why LW was changed because AD casters used it to burst down squishies but Void Staff does literally the exact same thing and nobody cares? CDR getting handed out for free on every single item you could  possibly want. Mage now deal constant DPS. Get a mana battery so large and regen from the passive that you actually **have to try** to go OOM from Morello. You still got Flat Magic Pen operating at 100% instead of the watered down Lethality system too\r\n\r\nExplain to me how {{item:3165}} isn&#039;t an OP stat stick thats viable on almost every mage? Yet somehow {{item:3147}} is? One that gives a massive powerspike all at once with 112% gold efficiency ***from stats alone*** for no gold compared to an item that needs others to scale up?\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous.
