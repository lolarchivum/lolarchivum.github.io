It makes sense that every champion should have an equal chance to succeed for whatever niche they have but I kind of get the feeling that Riot deliberately overbuffs and overnerfs to just change the meta dramatically. \n\nIt doesn&#039;t seem like they are actually trying to balance the game as much as just rotating through the champions for what&#039;s strong. In other words, it feels more like their balance philosophy is about showcasing a group of champions for a month or two and then either overbuffing or overnerfing to switch to a new group.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctrorpheus","date":"2016-06-10T02:40:46.658+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":11,"body":"Of course that is what they're doing.\n\nKeeps you from getting bored and quitting.","replies":[{"poster":"SirPurrr","date":"2016-06-10T02:48:31.671+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doctrorpheus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gU8zh6cy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-10T02:40:46.658+0000)\n>\n> Of course that is what they&#x27;re doing.\n> \n> Keeps you from getting bored and quitting.\n\nI'd much rather have an actually balanced game than artificial changes.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-06-10T03:01:09.498+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agreed, can you imagine how much more interesting the game would be, both competitively and casually if there were even just 10 more common picks.","replies":[{"poster":"61119563DEL1","date":"2016-06-10T06:22:46.165+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes and instead of circle jerk balance changes.
