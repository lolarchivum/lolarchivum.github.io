Was broken on release despite being 5% on hit because the lifesteal was way higher and the active stealed more health and ms. League of botrk.\nThen nerfed on several occasions and then on 4.10 nerfed heavily on lifesteal but buffed on on-hit (8% (!)) cause Riot wanted it to be anti-tank ; ms steal nerfed.\nAt that point it was kinda ok; quite strong.\nThen for some reason in 5.8 they decided lifesteal should apply the on-hit. Pretty strong buff, item borderline OP.\n5.10 they buffed it (???) on the active range.\nThen 5.22 they butchered it (price increased, on-hit 6%)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYeah considering the price increase, maybe 8% would be ok now, idk.

A hp health buyer buster (either a tank or a bruiser which happen to buy a lot of health), no?**\n\n**What does {{item:3153}}  do right now? Work better on squishies than on hp buyers**\n\nIt is a paradox for a in item which damage come mainly from %health damage, but is just the reality of the situation\nA tank/bruiser get more damage from %health damage on passive, but at least has high resistence and given the low raw damage stats the item BoTRK contribute little to the rest of his overall damage\nA squishy has almost no resistence so it is affected by both the damage on passive and by the offensive stats the item gives and in the end BoTRK is more effective against them than against tank\n\nAnd it will always be this way for instrinsec reasons as long as the item works this way, whether the item is gutted or overpowered (and at 7% will still be one or the other depending on the rest of the game balance)\n\nThere is only ONE way to change this, and it is put % max health damage alongside % current health damage, because it is the only way on which an item that work that way can affect hp buyers more than squishies\n\nBut I also see the concern on doing that, obviously. \nPut % max health damage on an item everyone can buy is a big potential risk (unless the number is very low but then it would be ineffective), and would also show flaws in their design philosophy, as they are keep increasing the usage of %max hp damage on kits, even though gated by the famours 3-hit passives or things like those and would force them to put big amount of work to redesing the power balance of various champs that have %max hp damage as part of their power to avoid completely unbalanced situations with champ abusing the synergies with that and other items (es. pick/ban Vayne)\n\nSo, they are in a cul-de-sac (a dead end), they either have an item that is inherently unbalanced, and at that point better to make it clear if it is gutted or overopwered and intentionaly not go for a middle ground and make their balance levers easier to use for them, or make the change required that carry in itself a huge risk\n\nAnd they should better clarify this thing once and for all, because the situation is, well,  non sustainable. \n\nThey don't want to use %max hp on such a similar item? OK, but then let's make it clear to costantly work and gie special attentionon the champs that should use those items\nThey want to make the item effective for what is meant to be?
