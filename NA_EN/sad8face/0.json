You are deliberately being toxic and inflammatory. If this is your 22nd account ban (didn't think that was actually possible) you might want to try changing your behavior. It can be easy to get frustrated in competitive play but take into account and ask yourself if it is worth it losing your account?\n\nThen again since this is allegedly your \"22nd\" ban, I don't think you care and I'm surprised you haven't been IP banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2016-09-05T00:42:31.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sad8Face","date":"2016-09-04T20:33:28.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Yes it is and that is in fact a Riot employee.
