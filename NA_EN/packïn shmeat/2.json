(Not including Udyr or Nidalee, because these are kinda just extra abilities.) Thing that come to my mind is Urgot but I can see him using it in lane when ally jg is ganking his lane. Then I also thought about Rek sai. Her ultimate is close to useless late game. It provides nothing in late game in a 5v5 fight and even if you have a tunnel behind the enemy to try to kill squishies they probably have destroyed it because they saw it from wards. Hell Urgot can go tank and switch positions with an enemy tank if he is caught out.  I would love to hear the rest of the community's opinions. :)\n~UPDATE- Corki doesn't count as it is basically an extra ability and not an ult.","replies":[{"poster":"M0RDEKA1SER","date":"2016-06-09T01:21:20.920+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"{{champion:27}}  seriously, no one's mentioned this guy yet?","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-06-09T01:33:54.449+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sindalla,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oU1MNT2K,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-06-09T01:21:20.920+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:27}}  seriously, no one&#x27;s mentioned this guy yet?\n\nThat's one of teh best ults out there.

His ult would be pretty garbage on the majority of champions, but since his teamfight presence extends approximately as far as 'give ADC attack speed' without it it's just a good enough ability to use in a fight. It debuffs the enemy team quite effectively in an AOE, which is OK for Nunu because he already gives his carry so much gold in AS, meaning stripping the enemy team of MS and AS is quite good.\n\nI actually think Absolute Zero is marginally stronger than The Box. They're both similar abilities in their end goal (clog a chock of cut the enemy team) but I think Nunu's is stronger due to the threat it presents and AS debuff. Nunu's ult is good because it forces the enemy team to waste CC on a champ who is basically worthless once he's hit his W anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylverblitz","date":"2016-06-09T00:54:16.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"For a few different reasons I think these are pretty underwhelming.\n\n{{champion:82}}  Unless it kills someone it feels like a longer ignite.\n{{champion:19}}  It stops the target moving but it also leaves him just as vulnerable albeit with the ability to stop it.\n{{champion:90}}  As with above it leaves him vulnerable and immobile plus the rework took a lot of power from it.","replies":[{"poster":"sneezing slug","date":"2016-06-09T02:31:32.537+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sylverblitz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oU1MNT2K,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-06-09T00:54:16.212+0000)\n>\n> For a few different reasons I think these are pretty underwhelming.\n> \n> {{champion:82}}  Unless it kills someone it feels like a longer ignite.\n> {{champion:19}}  It stops the target moving but it also leaves him just as vulnerable albeit with the ability to stop it.\n> {{champion:90}}  As with above it leaves him vulnerable and immobile plus the rework took a lot of power from it.\n\nIt sounds to me like you just don't know how to use those champions correctly then.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-06-09T01:34:39.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"{{champion:163}} Knocked out of her ult by any damage. and wall decays pretty fast for an ultimate","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-06-09T01:37:38.588+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Really?

The widths are similar so pretty much anyone with a dash can go though, (maybe vayne woudl be the exception) and sure is longer than aivia wall but there is only so many places where you can use it to full extent than 90% of the time an anivia wall would be just as effective.
