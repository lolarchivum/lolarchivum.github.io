Passive: after coming out of stealth, teemo gains increased atkspd for X seconds (atkspd boost increases with rank) every AA on an enemy champ with this buff active reduces the cd of his E by Y seconds. Active: Teemo stops moving and instantly stealths. Teemo stays stealthed until he makes another action (attacking, casting spells) If in brush, stealth is not broken by moving, if stealth is broken by moving while outside of brush, stealth takes 1 second before it actually breaks.

In return for this when teemo traps a brush it has slight toxic miasma effect around it. This would make the trap more easily found in exchange for the extra power. This change would make the bush traps more of herding tools than killers since people would be less likely to stumble into them, but it would also create a new mind game for him to play.","replies":[]}]}
