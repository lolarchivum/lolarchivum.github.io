So, another 4-6 months before Twitch's updates get started?\n\n>As for the &quot;anomaly&quot; that was PP Taric. I know I have mentioend to you in the past that we are trying to make the time between VGU  -&gt; new skin much shorter.  I can understand why at this point you want to be cautious about but it is something we want to continue doing in the future. Or at least something I will continue to bug the skins team about :)\n\nIt's not about \"wanting to be cautious,\" but knowing that past behaviors can predict future patterns.\n\nFor several years, I've heard from different members of the skins team, both in person, on these boards and social media, that even if Yorick wasn't on the \"no skins until rework\" list, he'd probably have one skin every 2-3 years, if that.  It's too much work for the team due to multiple models, particles and assets (each of which needs to be updated for the new skin), and the champ just isn't popular enough to warrant the extra work (Riot's purposeful intention).\n\nAnd that's not even taking to consideration how well received this new rework is going to be.  It could be as successful as Poppy/Taric or it could be another Mordekaiser/Skarner/Shen that misses many marks in favor of being \"innovative.\"  I even hear \"Yorick's going to be metal as f*ck,\" but there's no one willing to attempt to prove those statements or are are confident enough to make a friendly wager with me.\n\n(For the record, the bet was he money I spent on League, some $2100 over five years, going to charity if the rework isn't the best thing ever vs some equivalent punishment since I make a fraction of what a Rioter makes in a month.)\n\nSo... why _should_ I believe the skins team would put any new, potential money generating skins on hold and spend the time to make a new Yorick skin quickly after his release?  Just because someone from Riot says they want to?  I'm sorry, but any faith I had in Riot's noble intentions were burned out of me when the Freljord became a thing, Trundle went from a sympathetic poop troll to a generic ice one, and Narrative went from a content generating department to one that did nothing for nearly two years but treat lore fans like garbage.\n\nSo, yeah.  That's where I'm coming from, and why I still believe that we'll see a new Yorick skin after I turn 41 (February 2018).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ajimu Najimi","date":"2016-07-13T19:11:38.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=siBwE09d,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-13T17:51:33.824+0000)\n>\n> Hey Moonboy65!\n> \n> We just finished shipping Ryze which had 9 splash arts!
