I submitted a furiously written support ticket and was given this response:\n\n(Edit - here is the full ticket: http://prntscr.com/qoz9gl )\n\n\"Hey there FancyPants,\nThanks for reaching out to us. The community can get very frustrating at times, and we're doing our very best to improve it. Of course, it's not a one man job, and your reports are one of, if not the most important piece for us to do something about these problems within our playerbase.\nI do agree that there should be some sort of leeway in terms of losing a game due to players AFKing. It'd be good to see it happen. It's a very good idea.\nThis is gonna be a bummer but sadly, I am unable to send this directly to our devs but I highly recommend to post this idea in the boards since the devs check those from time to time, believe me.\nWho knows? Maybe if enough players chime in to the discussion and it gains enough traction, the devs might consider doing a rework in the matchmaking system.\nIf you have any additional questions or concerns, don't hesitate to let me know.\n🤠 ~ Auggie ~ 🤠\nRiot Games Player Support\"\n\nAFK players mean more than players that have disconnected for longer than the DC grace period. Players that just sit around in fountain are more harmful to a game than someone that will fill team chat with toxic behavior or even flat out leave. These players are still allowed to determine our league of legends experience with little harm to them and absolutely no compensation to us.\n\nNow I know not making an argument or suggestion will get me nowhere so here's a few quick thoughts:\n1: Matchmake people with a large amount of AFK reports or leaverbuster warnings/offenses together; keep them out of the games with players that actually want to win. The amount of offenses/reports should not decrease depending on how many games they play until the end but rather after a set amount of time, 3 patches for example.\n2: Compensate the players that were forced into a loss with a portion of the LP that they lost. This can't be done instantly at the end of games but the process should be automated to determine if there was a leaver based on an amount of reports or if a player was disconnected past the grace period. This should also be a process that can be appealed due to abuse of report stacking (x9'ing, etc.). \n3: The \"Life happens, we get it..\" loading tip _should_ still apply. Give all players 2 or 3 games in which disconnecting is not punishable, but allow certain keywords in the report screen to appeal that thought. If a player rage quits it should not count towards their allotted disconnected games.\n4: Rewrite a page out of DOTA 2's book. Instead of placing players that leave in a lower priority queue, you should also place players that consistently play out games in a higher priority queue. That does _not_ mean that more players should be autofilled in games as that happens enough. I'm sure there's a gritty way of figuring out that system but that's a topic for another time.\n\nThank you for reading my ideas on this subject. Just as Riot Auggie said, it's up to us to bring this to the attention of the devs as it's not something anyone else can do. Upvote this here on boards, post it on Reddit, retweet it, share it on facebook, 4chan even, I don't care. AFK players defining the experience of the game for everyone is unacceptable and it's time that there were a few changes made to the way it's handled.","replies":[{"poster":"WoollyWitch","date":"2020-01-17T12:00:19.881+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aimléss","date":"2020-01-18T15:07:08.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea, I'll tweak it a little bit.

That kind of solution might help a little, but for every leaver that it discourages, it probably will create a new type of jerk that gives up and spends the rest of the game trying to bully someone else into leaving.\n\nThe only way this problem gets solved is by baiting players into finishing a game, with positive rewards that keep the team working together. (For example, losing less LP if you're team put up a good fight, by stealing an objective or winning a teamfight, before losing in the long-run.) Lopsided punishments for leavers will just lead to more bickering about leavers, and make people focus on the dilemma between sticking around with shitty teams vs. losing more LP.
