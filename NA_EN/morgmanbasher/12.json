I try to play safe in lane and just go for trades and all ins only when i know i can win but if i have to play a safe lane it's almost impossible to carry because my toplaner is 0/8 my midlaner is 1/5 and my jungler is afk in a bush, and this is over 40+ games and it's the same story every single game! Ill give some examples here my last game I had a zed mid who died 8 times to a zoe and the jungler had died 5 times trying to save him so basically even though i was ahead in lane by 2 kills it didn't matter because zoe could all of the sudden 1 shot everyone on our team too me that sounds like a matchmaking issue. Prior to that game had a teemo top vs a garen the garen of course has 5 solo kills within 10 mins. I understand that because I main ADC I kind of have the short end of the stick as far as carry potential goes in the current state of the game but it also should not be the case that if you are not or do not have a smurf on your team you auto lose, that basically defeats the entire allure of ranked if every game is a stomp because one team is playing there main role in one division while the other team is off-role 2 divisions lower than they normally are. This is also the case for all my friends at the moment whether they are low silver or high plat, I have one friend who has been at least plat since season 3 and he can't even get through his gold promos because of the matchmaking right now.","replies":[{"poster":"BigFBear","date":"2019-02-07T06:29:28.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice block you built there...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ÈvilMorty","date":"2019-02-05T20:57:15.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My recent gold 1 promos\nBot lane irellia with cleanse with taric, they actually didnt do too bad but picked way too many fights we couldnt win, 1v5 dives, died the ,most.
