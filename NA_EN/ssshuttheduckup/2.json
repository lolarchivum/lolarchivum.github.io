His thematics and kit go together pretty nicely, he's a rage fueled Berserker warrior.. plays like it.\n\nReasons to rework Tryndamere:\n1. His graphics aren't the best but they aren't too bad, his voice lines are bad though.\n2. He is stat-checky, and there's some frustration dealing with him.\n3. His W is kind of a weird and outdated kinda skill.\n\nSo I think Tryndamere overall, would be more like a mini update - some stats changed around, maybe 1 spell completely changed (W) - but fulfilling a simular function, the others minorly adjusted, with a new model and voice lines, such as Ezreal or Morgana.
