So it's not much that he doesn't understand but you can't read properly. The only case possible would be throwing trap as minion enters, so that Turret targets the trap and delays the minion killing by circa 2 seconds.

Destroy in the title while disarm and \"shoot at\" are in the description. I was not entirely sure what would be more balanced / fair. On one side, destroying would render the ability useless unless actively sieging a tower with a wave, but once the wave is gone, the traps would be destroyed, thus loosing their pressure and some of their value, it also would makes their usually longer cooldown a bit less justified. On the other hand, if they were only disabled, the pressure would only temporarily be disabled, but it would become much more confusing and harder for defenders to time when traps will reactivate, despawn, and/or deactivate. Not to mention it is one more thing to pay attention to on both sides. \n\nI am leaning more towards destroy though, since disarming more or less is the same as it is now. Currently traps under towers are revealed if hidden, and can be cleared by players. They also tend to be more useless then beneficial if no enemies are nearby to utilize them when they go off (unless you are Caitlyn and get the range increase for a headshot).","replies":[]}]}]}
