Like how Maw and Sterak&#039;s have the same unique passive name, but different functionalities, these two items should have the same kind of set-up. For example, take Rengar with {{item:3102}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3139}} and {{item:3156}} is 4.5 ability defenses (2 full blocks, 1 shield, 2 hard cc removals) which all more or less need to be burned to actually start to kill him with AP based abilities. Add a {{item:3222}} on an ally and he now has 2 of every anti-ability/hard CC function.\r\n\r\nBut back to my point. these two items should have the same unique passive name since they do almost the exact same thing, but currently can be stacked.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-02-09T07:36:22.617+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3814}} -active.\n\n{{item:3102}} -passive.\n\nSo how do they share a passive?","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-02-09T19:33:02.690+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about changing Banshee's Veil to an Active effect similar to Edge of Night.
