I had my misgivings, but after playing her for several games, I have fallen in love with her gameplay. There is no feeling like turning around a fight with your heals, or getting to your ally in the nick of time. Using your Astral Infusion on a Deathmarked target and then seeing the enemy Zed allchat \"F U RAKA\" is the best feeling in the world.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am seeing people discussing Soraka's dangerous positioning in teamfights and especially her unclear itemisation. Smart players are learning that taking out Soraka quickly in teamfights is important, and Soraka has extremely limited options to deal with such eventualities. This leads me to an idea to encourage her martyr-like playstyle:\r\n\r\n#Salvation\r\n\r\n**NEW:** In addition to her current passive, when Soraka dies, she releases a wave of healing energy in a 400 units circle around her body. Allied champions in the area are healed for [(Level x 40) + 0.4 AP]. If Soraka dies as a result of casting Astral Infusion, the AoE increases to 600 units and the AP ratio increases to 0.6. This effect triggers even if Soraka is under the effect of Guardian Angel or Zilean's Chronoshift.\r\n\r\n#Astral Infusion\r\n\r\n**REMOVED:** ~~Cannot be cast if Soraka is below 5% of her max health.~~\r\n\r\n*-*\r\n\r\nComments and criticism welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"Avious","date":"2014-10-03T19:37:46.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Piñata Soraka Rito plz.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-03T19:38:38.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay that made me laugh a lot IRL.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Avious","date":"2014-10-03T12:05:17.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a nice idea to encourage Soraka to dive deep in fights, but I would hate it if she could suicide with her heal...","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-03T17:08:24.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the idea is to make a calculated decision.

During this time, the stars overwhelm her power to sustain her life, disabling Soraka but allowing her to cast her heal for no cost. Soraka can only sustain this overwhelming power for 3/4.5/6 seconds before her time is spent and she dies.\n---\n\nThis gives Soraka a Karthus-like ult, allowing her to continue healing for a short while, but unable to follow her teammates if the fight moves. This resolves the issue where she is focused first, as if you kill her first she has a few seconds where she can heal at will, making a small area around her dangerous to fight in with her high hps healing. It also allows for the counterplay of keeping her teammates out of her reach, while also tying in with her lore, where the stars took their power from her as punishment for doing harm, as now they can reward her for giving everything to saving people from it.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-04T05:31:59.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that dilutes the identities for both her and Karthus, by making them a polar opposite mirror of each other. Furthermore, if her heals become free, she can cast them on cooldown. At 40% CDR and with 6 seconds of her passive, that can easily equal 5-6 heals, which is basically the same amount of heals Soraka would cast if she was alive (I rarely cast more than 4-5 heals per teamfight).\n\nOverall, it does a lot more healing than my suggested passive and allows her to concentrate that healing into a single person rather than spreading it out into an AoE (which means that some of her heal can be wasted on a full-health target). Your suggested passive also lets her cast her ult, for massive group healing, and even lets her protect her ADC with an Equinox if she has to. It's just way too powerful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Avious","date":"2014-10-03T19:51:56.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just pictured her swelling and popping.

But if you give Soraka a healing wave upon death, then enemies are left with a poor choice of options:\n\n1. Focus not-Soraka; Soraka heals her team and you lose.\n2. Focus Soraka; Soraka dies but heals her team anyways.\n\nWhile thematically this makes sense, giving Soraka healing-upon-death is a low-counterplay way to add power to her kit. Soraka, despite staying low, should never actually want to die.\n\nAlso, it'll be really sad if someone accidentally kills themselves with a miscalculated infusion :x\n\n\\>> If Soraka's healing-upon-death effect a bad idea, then what about other upon-death effects, like Kog'maw, Karthus, Zyra, and new Sion? I think that the other three upon-death effects are fine because they each have counterplay: you can escape or dodge their damage. On the other hand, you can't stop Soraka's upon-death from healing her allies.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-03T17:32:28.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The key thing you're forgetting is that people still get gold for killing Soraka. This is extremely important. Soraka is specifically designed to be squishy, and she is punished for going tank. Her healing range puts her right in harm's way. This means that she is literally free gold for any assassin/ADC/APC who wants to delete her. Her self-defense capacities are severely limited (she only has Equinox, and she needs to choose whether to use it to defend herself or to defend her ADC if someone dives them) and her self-heal is designed to mitigate poke and skirmishes, rather than to help her survive burst.\n\nFurthermore, if Soraka kills herself with the W, she still gives the kill to someone who damaged her recently, just as if she died by a tower, minion or neutral monster. Given how close she has to be to the thick of the action in teamfights, it's practically guaranteed that she'll get hit by some random AoE, which means that if she suicides by Astral Infusion, she's still giving gold to someone (or even many, depending on how many assists the enemy gets on her death).\n\nSoraka right now has no counterplay for people who are smart enough to kill her first. Any smart player will realise that damaging Soraka is ten times more effective than damaging anybody else on her team, since her self-heal cannot sustain anything other than \"mild poke\" (which is really good for laning phase, but rather bad for teamfights). This new passive IS counterplay for the enemy team that just goes \"If Soraka gets within healing range, we immediately switch targets and kill her. If she doesn't get within healing range, she can't heal anybody and we just kill her team.\"\n\nAs for the other death passives: If you're melee, you can't actually stop Karthus from dealing damage to you, since he turns on his W automatically and you are right in the centre of it. You may get away before he kills you, sure, but you will take free damage whether you want it or not. Kog'maw's Icathian Surprise is actually impossible to outrun without flash or some dashing shenanigans, and it's designed to be that way. It may not kill you, but it's almost guaranteed you'll be eating a ton of true damage for free. Sion's new passive also gives him a movespeed burst designed to help him catch up with people and get free damage on them. He IS possible to outrun if you dash or are super fast, but they might also tweak this before he comes live. Zyra's is really the only death passive you can really dodge, and it's the most poorly-designed out of them all.","replies":[{"poster":"Lneacx","date":"2014-10-03T22:14:47.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a teamfight, someone's gold worth shouldn't be part of the decision-making procedure - everyone is worth the same gold anyways (ignoring kill/death sprees). In a teamfight, the question is: \"Who do we focus first?\"\n\nRight now, the choice is to kill her first to remove her healing. But if she gets a significant healing-upon-death, then no matter what you do she'll heal her team. This negates the effective choice the enemy has because she'll heal her allies no matter what.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-03T22:25:43.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of the decision making in teamfights is also \"how much reward am I getting for my efforts?\". If killing Soraka is very easy because she's squishy and must position herself in harm's way, then it's always a good idea to go for Soraka. It's more than just \"stopping her healing,\" but also \"I can easily delete this champion from the teamfight, get gold for it, and turn it into a 4v5.\"\n\nRight now, smart players are turning Soraka's situation into the opposite: the moment a teamfight breaks out, she get focused and dies before she can get a single heal out, or they make her waste her ult to save herself (which is still a net win). Soraka's cc is extremely finicky and hard to land, so her main contribution to the team is healing. She doesn't have the pick potential that a Morgana, Thresh, Blitz, Leona, Nami or Sona (with flash+crescendo) have, she can't tank a crapload of damage like Braum (who also has pick potential with Q and ult), she doesn't have Janna's unparalleled disengage or Zyra's oppressive poke (and again, both of those can make picks with clever uses of their ults).\n\nThose types of supports can make good plays and turn the tide of a teamfight, so it's fine if they die afterwards, they've done their job (and likely traded their lives for that of a more valuable member of the enemy team). Soraka cannot afford to die at all. When I play Soraka, I play her like she's the most valuable team member, even more valuable than the ADC, and if we don't have initiators, I allow my teammates to get caught so that I can then save them and turn the teamfight around. This is why it's imperative that Soraka has a way to do her job even if she dies. If Soraka dies, the team might as well be dead in the water.\n\nI think people still haven't realised that Soraka is a completely different support from everybody else, and requires a completely different playstyle.

That's the hard cc, and it works exactly like Swain's W and Viktor's W. If you add a delay to it, you make it pretty much identical to those abilities.\n\nI suppose a good compromise could be channel-cancelling for the first .5 seconds, but if that's the case, she needs a buff to compensate. The ability to peel for her carry is something Soraka is very weak at, and a reflexive instant silence is literally ALL she has. If we give her that, she needs some form of hard CC (maybe turn the snare on her E into a stun, and have the Q be a slow that snares if it hits the centre?).","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-10-05T12:47:41.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don'T think she needs tha much of an abillity to peel.\nA strong slow on Q and the silence/root of E are strong tools together with the high healing she can provide to her carry.\nIf u have cc/peeling from other positions, there is really no problem for sora beeing not as strong for peeling, as she therefor has the massive healing.\n\nIf u pick sora in a setup with already low cc, it's ur own fault. there are plenty support options if u need more cc, but not that much that would complement an already cc-heavy comp.\nShe works really well if combined with adc that cc(mf, varus, ashe)","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-10-06T19:26:49.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Zed mid, Tryndamere/Riven top, Lee Sin jungle\"\nif u pick sora as support into a comp that lacks cc, u simply picked wrong.\nComplaining that sora struggles at peeling is like complaining that Braum lack sustain for his team and got no global ult.\nDifferent champs are designed for different jobs, and therefor fit into different teamcomps.\nAs a sustained healer, Sora should beffeckitve vs sustained damage and poke, but rather weak vs all ins, especially assasins.
