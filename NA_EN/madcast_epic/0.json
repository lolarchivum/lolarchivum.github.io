We are MadCast Gaming, and we&#039;re looking for some mature folks to enjoy playing games with.\n\n#**What Is MadCast?**\n\nMadCast is a gaming community that has been active for the past ten years. We&#039;ve worked very hard to create a place on the internet free from the dregs of gaming. Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.madcastgaming.com/ips/forums/topic/9584-intro-madcast-code-of-conduct/) is a product of those years, and the reason people have come and remain Full Members. We started out as a forum based group that incorporated a VoIP, and now we have grown over the years to be a well established community. You can find out more on our website, www.madcastgaming.com, or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XfwUCuW).  \n\nIf all this sounds like a fit for you, come play some games and help us to continue our legacy.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#**What Do We Play?**\n\nWe currently support three main branches: League of Legends and Blizzard games, and Destiny 2. We also have a strong following in PUBg, ARK, Guild Wars 2, a number of DnD/Tabletop games, and many more!  For our main games we host weekly events and tournaments; but we also have a number of tabletop groups and other startups that happen throughout the week.\n\nFor League of Legends, we currently host three weekly events: \n\n* **League of Learning**\n\nThursdays at 9:00 EST is when we help you with your game! Join us on Discord for some Inhouse 5v5 matches where our admins and players cover team-based tactics and individual skills. Come learn how to better yourself in a non-judgmental environment. Feel free to drop in!\n\n* **MadCast League**\n\nMadCast runs a bi-weekly tournament over the course of a couple months for their members. Full Members participate for bragging rights and RP prizes! Solid teams, good rivalries, and epic games await you.\n\n* ** Funday Monday **\n\nFunday Monday runs every Monday at 9:00 PM EST! Pile into Discord where an admin will roll dice to decide what kind of fun game modes will be played that night! Ionia vs Noxus? Team Mechanic? Team SMITE? Who knows what it will be, but be sure to be in Discord before the start time to enjoy this always entertaining batch of inhouses!\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#**How Do You Join?**\n\nTo be a Full Member of MadCast, you can head to the [introduction section](https://www.madcastgaming.com/ips/forums/forum/5-introductions/) of our forums and post an intro. Feel free to have a look at some of the others if you need some encouragement as to how. Share a little, or a lot! We just want to get to know you.\n\n You are not required to apply for Full Membership in order to hang out around these parts.  If you wish to just hang around and get to know the folks before applying for FM, then the most you need to abide by is that of our CoC.  Some people apply right away, and some have taken a year or better to finally decide to apply for FM.  The choice is entirely up to you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any more questions about MadCast or anything of the like, toss us an add in game:\n\n{{champion:202}}  ** MadCast: Epic**\nIGN: MadCast Epic\n\n {{champion:45}} MadCast: Shenaniquin\nIGN: Unusedcaveman\n\n{{champion:17}}  ** MadCast: Baal**\nIGN: MadCast Baal\n\n{{champion:236}} **MadCast: Mike**\nIGN: MadCast Mike\n\n{{champion:21}} **MadCast: Aeryx**\nIGN: MadCast Aeryx\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks again for taking the time to read this post, and be sure to check us out at www.madcastgaming.com. \n\nWe look forward to meeting you!\n\nDiscord link:  https://discord.gg/XfwUCuW","replies":[{"poster":"Locke109","date":"2017-04-19T13:29:18.026+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a great time playing with you all last night.

Over that time I have met some very interesting people, some who have come to be very good friends. I've never had issues finding folks to play games with, and always had something to do at the end of the day. \n\nI won't oversell this place, or make it seem like it's better than everywhere else; but you get what you put into it, and I'll probably stay with this community for the rest of my gaming career.\n\nIf your looking for a place to call home, post an [introduction](http://www.madcastgaming.com/ips/forums/forum/5-introductions/) on our forums.
