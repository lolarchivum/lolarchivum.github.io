AA once and this disadvantage is negated. for the heal, honestly if you want to play kayle for the heal you might as well play sylas or go support and pick soraka. anyway this is exactly what i said, give her actual GOOD ap ratio so there is a reason to build ap, for example, a Q > lichbane AA > E aa reset burst. right now even if you build for it kayle have mediocre ratio for mediocre burst. right now you are clearly forced into pure DPS , and for pure dps, crit kayle is the best option without any contest.  HO and the ult i just checked, you'll deal around 1050 dmg with AP, and 800 dmg with crit . this is ridiculous","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-03-13T20:42:19.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"AP is better with less items (early on) due to having a flat 20% scaling whist AD needs to stack at least 75% critchance and IE to get useful, that´s 3 items. \n\nHer W at max rank with 500 AP is a 330 heal+100% bonus movespeed for 2 seconds, highly significant for self peel and protection ....although this might just be my opinion. \n\nBut it is true that her R scaling seems strange at first, however one has to keep in mind that while stuff like 500+ AP is nothing but basic having much more than .....250?
