You can see this with even Boxer Pete going up against Ornn. Usually Bramble Vest is just a meme because it only hurts sustain as its main cause of use, and if we're talking about negating damage like any other item, things like Glacial Shroud give CDR and MP on top of it and end with higher gold efficiency. {{item:3077}}  and {{item:3078}} are immensely popular on Aatrox because it skips past the sustain issue and goes straight for raw damage.\n\nGP/Camille both are capable of actually assisting their team in the top lane compared to most of the roster. This is backed further by their \"passable\" early games that in past seasons were literal garbage unless they were at their overtuned state. Capable of teamfighting but not exactly their overall forte, solo queue is more about picks and these champions are near god status in being capable of doing that.\n\nMany other top laners either have an \"eh\" keystone or in general have lower base stats than what is needed to scale properly from the lane itself. \n\nBase AD going up ironically helps everyone *but* the top laner, since you still go practically glass cannon and only *later* itemize tanky. Remember Atmog's? Remember unkillable bruisers that just stacked that? THAT was when bruisers were viable. When they built tanky and were capable of being raid bosses on their own. Undeniably outscaled tanks, and I remember picking a tank back in the day was basically trolling unless it was an ultra-specific one (i.e. Singed, Mundo, Shen).\n\nFunny how bruisers rely that heavily on tank itemization and base damages. At the end of the day you were a tank with less CC and more damage, and now all of the builds are all glass cannon first, tanky later. And with the pace of games right now, the tank stats come way too late or *not at all.* There's no balance for bruisers and they'd need a hell of a lot of work rather than simple buffs/nerfs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2018-02-18T18:35:20.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what?
