Consider the length of time the NFL only had a run first oriented offense. For decades the risk of moving the ball forward due to pass seemed a poor choice. In addition, on the defensive side of the ball the 4-3 (4 down linemen 3 linebackers) was dominant for years until the 3-4 (3 down linemen 4 linebackers) came into favor and receded again. In the NBA the low post presence has dominated the game since its inception.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn these examples the drive to change comes at extreme economic cost. The value of consistently winning games is the highest priority for professional teams. The best strategy is to rely on consistent winning strategies with thousands of iterations of field testing. As a result the value of winning professional games comes at a secondary cost --- innovation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innovation in these sports or changes in the meta come from the amateur ranks, namely the college and high school ranks. In the college football scene there are a tremendous and wide variety of strategies and formations being used. From spread offenses, triple options, and ball control there is a wide variety of metas in play. In the college hoops scene there is a tremendous variety of zone defense, teams that emphasize motion offense, or guard dominated play. The variety of offensive and defensive present in the college game is too long to accurately list. \r\nIn essence the innovation in strategy comes from the lower tiers of play, the upper tiers only sharpen the execution to a razor point. \r\n\r\nSo if you want to change the meta it’s up to the community to develop strategies to combat it. If the general player base knew the strengths of the current meta (i.e ability based champions going mid to take advantage of power spike) and why it is employed so exclusively it could help innovation.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-07-15T19:55:42.572+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Succinct and to the point.

Or when Link first started on CLG and picked Syndra?).\n\nWe talk about the pro scene as reinforcing optimal play, I'm unsure if it's optimal so much as safe.

Currently the game is heavily favouring and is being shoe horned into the current team setups with the only variance, between now and what it was a few months ago, being the popular picks. \n\nCurrently, and this is even reinforced in public games, pro teams are using the same laning strategy that was pretty much developed way back when I first started playing back in late S1/S2. From what I have seen, Riot seem to have enjoyed this style of play and have made a lot of effort to set this into stone. This isn't so much as a bad thing provided that there is diversity with the champions being selected. However, this hasn't been the case much at all and I can see that you guys at Riot are well aware of this and are wanting to fix it, at least I hope. \n\nYou guys have this impressive Champion roster a lot of which has some really cool champions and ideas that could really make for some exciting games both as a spectacle for an eSports environment and for public games in both normal and ranked options but it isn't used. Every LCS, every split, every official competition is always the same 30 or so champions that is deemed to be the strongest at the time with little to no variation at all. So much so that casters can almost always guestimate the 6 bans and 10 picks with almost complete accuracy. I want to see more champions being a viable option. I want to see more champions being picked, more ideas being tested, more strategies coming out. What is Riot doing to bring options like these to light?","replies":[{"poster":"MaknBacnPancakes","date":"2014-07-16T09:29:49.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a tough balance issue man...

If Riot is to neuter the 30 or so \"viable\" options of champions in favor of decking out some of the bottom guard (Sion, Urgot, etc..) then you eventually run into the same \"stale issue\" with the new batch of \"now strong\" bunch.\n\nI applaud Riot for not taking the knee jerk stance and just nerfing/buffing across the board, and I hope what I see is tactful patching in hopes of a delicate balance, and not a company overwhelmed and buried in a hole of their own making (an overly large roster).

There is a problem with Riots current balance ideals that's leaving a lot of strategies that could be employed unusable. Riot doesn't have to neuter the top 30 champions at all. There isn't a problem with these champions being viable. The problem is that the rest of the  80 or so champions being either so situational that the situation to pick them only comes up once every never or so bad in the current meta that they are the feast or famine champions without the feast. Look at Dota for example. Icefrog recently went through and systematically buffed, changed and added/reworked abilities to make as many heroes as viable as possible for the up coming TI4. It worked and it worked amazingly. There has never been a time where so many heroes in that game have been so viable and there is a myriad of strategies available for use. It's some of the most exciting MOBA/ARTS competitive games I have seen since I first started watching league sports in S2. Why is it that in just the qualifiers alone, nearly *EVERY* hero was seeing at least a pick or ban with only a few weeks here and there where only between 1-5 would see neither. Compare that to Leagues current. The only access to this information I have been able to see is the LCS at the start of the year where 50 champions were picked and banned across both LCS and OGN. Not quite sure how accurate that information is but that's still really not acceptable. \n\nGiven that the game boasts this impressive roster and *claims* to want innovative, unique and interesting strategies, why does it try so hard to shoehorn the game into the same laning strategies, the same small handful of champions picked and the same game plans every game. Early aggression, early dominance and early control is king right now and with the way that a lot of champions now scale better than they should given their early game strengths, there is no draw back to this. There is no reason to take someone who needs to hit 3 or 4 items before they can finally fight with impact when you can pick someone that could walk into a fight with brown boots and a sunfire cape or a BT or a half finished deathcap and still crush up. When another similar, but different, game can boast a large champion/hero pool and have those champions/heroes being viable in the highest of competitive play why is it that League cannot? Is there something wrong with their design and balance philosophies? Or is it that they've listened to the lowest common denominator for too long that they can't back out now and suddenly change up their game for the better.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-07-15T20:52:40.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which trickles down into the primary community.

The game IS restricted. The game IS stale and it's not because of the pros at all. They can't pick \"outside of the meta\" or \"change the meta\" as far as changing how they lane or picking a different sort of carry because the option isn't there to do so. They can't forego a jungler in favour of a duo top lane with a roaming support. They can't put much else midlane except for an assassin or a mage. They can't support any other champion bar ADCs because if they do anything other than that, they will lose because it's not optimal. There are further restrictions as other champions /are/ severely outclassed and outmatched against the current top tier. They aren't perceived to be. They are. The mobility creep has been such a defining role in further etching the meta into stone that champions are being released with gap closers built in, both offensive and defensive in the case of Braum. Older champions or champions that don't have the luxury of built in mobility get left behind because they can't compete with them. \n\nADCs, or Marksmen in case any rioter is reading this (I don't wanna be murdered), suffer greatly here. Immobile carries like Ashe, Kog'maw and Varus get bogged on because they can't survive in the high mobile, high burst, high CC environment that League is right now. Having those sorts of champions isn't bad, by all means that's not what I'm saying but there has to be something that counters that. Something like an ability like Puck, from Dota. Her ultimate tethers all affected to the cast point. The hero is free to move but only within the range that is dictated by the ultimate. If they break the tether by moving too far away, they take damage and are stunned. Why not introduce something like that to bring an equilibrium to the mobile vs immobile champions?\n\nFighters and tanks are being left behind because they either don't have mobility or they don't do damage whilst being difficult to kill. They either can't stick to a target or they can't kill their target once they are there. Fighters like Renekton had started to see play because they can do both. Same deal with Shyvanna and Vi with Lee Sin and Jax (Jax is more like a carry, though). Even champions post nerf like Kha Zix were still strong as  hell purely because of how their kit worked.\n\nSupports are just as bad. The current top tier for supports are Thresh, Annie and Leona. Very rarely do you ever see any of these seeing a pick or a ban in any level of play both professional and casual, low elo or high elo. The other supports either don't have the stats, the items or the CC and mobility in comparison to the top tier. It's not because they are terrible, it's because they are being compared to the titans of their class. They can't compete. They need help. The titans can still be titans, by all means. Bring the others up to the level of top tier or just under it. \n\nThen you have the case where an old Champion is picked up and tried elsewhere and does very well. Instead of balancing them around this aspect, as well as their intended role, Riot nukes them from orbit because that's not how the champion was designed to play. The Champion finally got dusted off but was immediately taken away because people were whinging and instead of shaving off the barbs that made the champion \"unfun and toxic\" to play against, they go straight for their balls and render them useless in the new role and never to be seen again for their intended roles.\n\n\n\nNB: I realise my response seems to be going all over the place.

He invented all kinds of things including the moving pocket.  The West Coast Offense began with Don Coryell who was a coach for the St. Louis Cardinals.  Pro beginnings either way.\n\nAt the same time pros reinforce the meta, they also create the meta itself.  For example, when a pro player picks jungle Wukong or support Annie, they make that champion viable in the eyes of the public.  It's a cycle of Pros create meta -> introduce new champions -> Meta evolves slowly -> prevents new changes -> patch changes / experimenting -> pros create meta ->....\n\nIt depends on where your analysis begins on the cycle for how much pros create or hinder diversity in a meta.  Without a pro scene, there is no meta and the top solo queue stomper becomes the favorite picks.  I'm not convinced it would be much different.\n\nIn the end, I would say champion imbalances hurt diversity more than anything else.  There's only 5 different roles in the game and 6 bans available.

When looking at recent champion releases and some older ones that remain relevant, this only becomes more clear.\n\nLook at supports for example, specifically Lulu, Thresh, Braum, and Nami. Thresh and Braum dominated the lineups almost immediately on release, largely because they've got great kits that do a lot, offer unique mechanics, and don't sacrifice anything. Lulu's been a relevant force that comes and goes, but has always had success in other lanes, and is currently tied for 2nd most picked in the NA LCS alongside Elise and Lee Sin. Her kit offers arguably more relevant utility than any other ranged supports. Nami's only started to become picked up after being left behind for so long, but she's still far behind Morgana who flew into popularity the minute the Spellthief's Edge line became a reliable source of early game gold, and stayed in popularity as a decent check to Thresh and later Braum.\n\nReworks such as Sona's, while they will make her a more relevant pick, only continue to build on the problem that a champion can't be relevant unless their kit does everything and then some. In the proposed rework, Sona will have her auras replaced for an AoE on-next-hit buff, AoE shield, and AoE haste with extra effect for Sona. She'll pretty much become a more consistent Karma who doesn't have to sacrifice an ultimate to boost only one of her abilities. Yes, Karma wasn't picked much anyways and she offers some bigger numbers, but just the idea that Sona will just beat her out on arrival and probably appear as at least a 2nd tier support in the pro scene, after having always been 1st or 2nd in the past before her current decline highlights the issues of balance for me. Is it something that will take time to fix? Sure. It just baffles me that  this problem seems to have persisted long enough to reach a point where the pool of champions actually feels stagnant, when it's never done that before the end of Season 2, and wasn't as big of an issue in Season 3.\n\nI've only detailed how the support line-up currently runs, but this problem exists in other roles as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2014-07-16T04:46:25.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The innovation in these sports or changes in the meta come from the amateur ranks, namely the college and high school ranks.
