But honestly, for the most part they all fall under the gauge of \"these champs do lots of damage but they are squishy!\" Now it's my personal OPINION, not fact, that champions that are building primarily tank items (i.e items that don't offer significant damage) should not be bursting, at all, ever. unless maybe it's like they are lv 18 and fighting a lv 11 champ.\r\n\r\nVolibear at level 10, did 1234 damage in 0/94 seconds and his exact build was {{item:1401}} {{item:1031}} {{item:1011}}  {{item:3047}} . I was playing eve yes im fully aware she is squishy. But a champion with 0 mr items is out bursting me? Doubling my damage? Not even that. Like frankly i dont care about eve not winning the 1v1 like it's the fact that volibear bursted me down, with literally not a single damage item. He also did most damage on his team. So it's really really ridiculous because like why let a champion sit there and do that much damage while also building purely tank. End game the only actual damage items he had was f.m and deadmans \"im only putting deadmans in as offensive because the ONE person is gonna say it's a damage item because it does like 60 magic damage.\r\n\r\nThis is just one experience but im pretty sure darius falls under this category as well and not only does he do fuck tons of damage but hes also mobile as shit.

You say that champs shouldn't be tanky and deal lots of damage (the entire concept of juggernauts). Ok.\n\nBut then, lets look at other scenarios and combinations. \n\nShould a champ be mobile and deal damage? Should they not have to buy mobilty items then in order to be mobile if they do damage?\n\nShould a champ be ranged and deal lots of damage? They already have lots of safety from range, why should they also deal lots of damage?\n\nShould a champ have stealth and deal tons of damage (basically very hard to counter them since you can't SEE them until it's too late much of the time, aka, eve, shaco, twitch, etc)?\n\nNow let's go further. Should a champ have tanky or defensive abilities, be highly mobile, have plenty of cc, have tons of burst, AND high dps, along with mixed damage? Does that sound familiar like, I dunno, jax or irelia or akali?\n\nSure akali's not tanky, but don't tell me even for a moment that she doesn't have plenty of defensive escape or prolonging tools. She can be at 5% hp, jump from a shroud and 100-0 the adc that's within 500-700 units of her shroud. She can also dash away. She even has a micro stun.\n\nYou can go on and on, but the fact is that, immobile champs that are able to build tanky while still dealing good damage is neither outrages nor unfair. I mean, what other purposes would those champs even serve? what reward would those champs have for being immobile? That they should do subpar CC and hit like a limp noodle while acting as less-than-great meatshields compared to say, ornn, tahm kench, shen, etc.?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ImTheJuggernauty","date":"2019-08-28T15:35:17.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol true, plus volibear needs to build up to even use his W bite.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mortismo","date":"2019-08-28T18:07:54.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you so afraid of posting on your main account?

They also tend to have more innate mobility. In fact, some even have better MS item options. Just look at Jhin. Have you ever seen the ones with two or three MS boosting crit items, which, on top of his passive MS boost on 4th AA and his excellent range and root and aoe slow, makes him incredibly difficult for someone like darius to approach even WITH flash and ghost (because remember, it's not darius's fault if jhin doesn't have flash up as well)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-08-28T09:14:07.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"HMMMM, an assassin player is frustrated about champions that are well regarded as a strong counter to assassins? \n\nIt makes perfect sense for a champion with high base damage to be scoring high on damage charts if hes fighting a lot. He is a damage threat by virtue of not dying quickly so his R can do heavy damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Alluring Touch","date":"2019-08-28T09:33:48.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No im frustrated that a champion who doesnt build damage does the same burst as an assassin. If you read my post i quite literally said i dont care that he is able to counter me, i truly find it good when assassins have counterplay. However it's an issue to me that someone builds straight tank and is one shotting. He can do it to adcs and mages too lol","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheJuggernauty","date":"2019-08-28T16:04:55.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't do the same burst though. He has a high hp pool and more resistances. So if you deal half his hp and he deals 100% of yours, he's doing so because you have half his hp and less resistances to mitigate his damage. In other words, if you got rid of resistances and gave each other the same HP Pool of about 2000, you might have actually killed him sooner.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2019-08-28T19:12:00.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alluring Touch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9xgvfha6,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-28T08:05:50.959+0000)\n>\n> Honestly yes sometimes assassins are big  annoying. \n> Sure fighters and adcs are sometimes annoying. But honestly, for the most part they all fall under the gauge of \"these champs do lots of damage but they are squishy!\" Now it's my personal OPINION, not fact, that champions that are building primarily tank items (i.e items that don't offer significant damage) should not be bursting, at all, ever. unless maybe it's like they are lv 18 and fighting a lv 11 champ.\n> \n> Volibear at level 10, did 1234 damage in 0/94 seconds and his exact build was {{item:1401}} {{item:1031}} {{item:1011}}  {{item:3047}} . I was playing eve yes im fully aware she is squishy. But a champion with 0 mr items is out bursting me? Doubling my damage? Not even that. Like frankly i dont care about eve not winning the 1v1 like it's the fact that volibear bursted me down, with literally not a single damage item. He also did most damage on his team. So it's really really ridiculous because like why let a champion sit there and do that much damage while also building purely tank. End game the only actual damage items he had was f.m and deadmans \"im only putting deadmans in as offensive because the ONE person is gonna say it's a damage item because it does like 60 magic damage.\n> \n> This is just one experience but im pretty sure darius falls under this category as well and not only does he do fuck tons of damage but hes also mobile as shit. It really bothers me that top lane gets so much leniency on what gets to stay ridiculous to play against\n\nIf you figure it out tell me pls. Its funny because if jugg in tank mode is bursting its fine but if tank dare to have any damage everyone is loosing mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2019-08-28T15:42:22.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a top laner, agreed.
