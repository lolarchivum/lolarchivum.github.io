Are you a moron? Are you so filled with unwarranted self-importance that you think that you understand this game better than people who have been playing it for years? Do you think you're some grand innovator who knows how to play Anivia better than people who have dedicated themselves to learning her through hundreds of games? Fuck you, you're nothing special, just a fucking nobody who will probably end up in bronze or low silver and unable to get out like most of this fucking playerbase.\n\nAnyway, warlord's bloodlust is bad on Anivia because lifesteal is bad on Anivia. Lifesteal is bad on Anivia because she isn't viable when built with AD, attack speed, or crit. None of her abilities scale with those stats, they all scale with raw AP, and she doesn't have any steroids that enhance the built stats' effectiveness. A champion like Talon builds full AD and armour penetration because his abilities have very good AD scaling and deal physical damage. An ADC like Jinx builds crit, attack speed, AD, and lifesteal because her kit has powerful steroids in the form of her passive and her Q that amplifies the effectiveness of the built stats. Anivia has nothing like that. Her Q only scales with AP, her W scales with nothing, her E scales with AP, and her ult scales with AP. None of her abilities increase the power of the stats mentioned that warlord's bloodlust is good for. So don't take it, it's bad on her. I'd recommend thunderlord's decree, since with an ult>Q>E it is very easy to proc it, and it has scaling with the AP you build.\nSincerely, PermabannedGaren\"","replies":[{"poster":"MeryXmas","date":"2017-03-07T21:06:19.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha gave me a good laugh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidarius","date":"2017-02-27T21:01:24.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont even bother, let him play and enjoy the game... let him experiment with AD {{champion:34}} and see for himself\n\ntrust me some people just need to learn the HARD way.\n\nto be honest thats how I learned LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2017-02-28T01:42:50.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's do some simple math.\n\nAnivia has about average attack speed at level one, but abysmally low attack speed at level 18, and is at best below average for attack damage at all levels.  Because she has below average stats for auto-attack focused builds, and none of her abilities scale off of anything but ability power, a good damage build on Anivia only includes AP, not AD (with the rare exception of a Hextech Gunblade, but that's an insanely situational build, and you don't build it for the attack damage).\n\nA typical build on Anivia results in her ult doing about 170 damage per second (80 base plus about 90 bonus (from 12.5% of 720, which is about typical end-game AP for her)).\n\nAt level 18, her AD is 106 and her attack speed is roughly 0.8, which means she can make a total of 5 attacks every six seconds, and on average deals 88 damage per second with auto attacks every second if she's continuously attacking, meaning that a standard build will result in her AA's doing about 51% of the damage her ult does in the same time against a single target.\n\nWarlord's Bloodlust caps out at 15% life steal at 80% missing HP.  15% of 88 is 13.2, so if you're at 20% or lower HP remaining, you'll heal 13.2 HP with an auto attack and Warlord's, _but only if it's against a champion_!  If it's against a minion, then you only heal for 1/4 of that, or 3.3 HP, which actually is _lower_ than your health regen at level 18 with a normal Anivia build.  If it's against a structure or monster (non-minion non-champion), you heal nothing (lifesteal and spellvamp don't work on damage to structures, and Warlord's doesn't work against monsters).  Once you take the averages (because no sane person is going to run around with only 20% HP all the time), you only get 7% lifesteal out of Warlords, which halves all the healing above, and thus means it has nearly no effect for Anivia.\n\nNow, by comparison, if you instead get Thunderlords, a typical build will give you (at level 18) an extra 250 damage every 15 seconds, or Deathfire Touch will get you an extra 95 DPS on your ult, both of which will kill the enemy faster, and by extension, reduce the amount of damage you take (the faster you kill a target, the less damage they can deal) and therefore reduces the need for you to heal proportionately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-02-27T16:36:34.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend's one reason why we need Wood Division.","replies":[]},{"poster":"no to toxic","date":"2017-02-27T15:43:08.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay i will tell you how you must do it:\n1.
