Up front: it's always a challenge communicating about our anti-cheat efforts, due to the fact that we don't want to tip off potential cheaters as to our tactics (they are many!) and when we'll be taking action.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is an issue we're passionate about tackling and, while we can't be super transparent in this space, we wanted to at least show we care a great deal about preserving the competitive integrity of League. We're going to continue ramping up our anti-cheating efforts for the future and, even if you don't hear from us, we hope you don't take our silence for inaction.","replies":[{"poster":"M0RDEKA1SER","date":"2015-06-11T00:10:52.347+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is exactly what I've been wanting from Riot on these boards!
