It seems they are intentionally censoring undesired messages and users.","subforum":"Discuss the Boards","up_votes":10,"down_votes":17,"body":"It has been some months since several users started to called out the \"Mod Team\" about some of their \"mistakes\".\nSeveral threads had been deleted for suspicious reasons, even when they were showing stats, in-depth thoughts and so on. Eg., about Pyke being out of control and reaching 60% ban rate (end of S9). That was my fav \"mistake\".\n\nNow, my case.\n\n\n\n# == Fact number 1. ==\nA Moderator (J.) deletes one of my comments, stating that it was violating the \"Golden Rule\".\nMy comment was a reply in a thread (by another user) called:\n**\"Riot's justifications for several preseason changes don't make any sense\"** ([here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Vy6ePyej-riots-justifications-for-several-preseason-changes-dont-make-any-sense)), and it was this one:\n\n> Indeed. That's basically the definition of incompetence. They don't even know what they're doing.\n> \n> Or, maybe, they know, and just try to \"sugarcoat\" their terrible philosophy about what's left of this game.\n\nRemoved _for violating the Golden Rule on the Boards: \"Always be respectful to players, community members, moderators, and Rioters. Harassment and insults will not be tolerated.\"_ \n\nNow. **Where are the harassment or the insults?**\n\n* \"This is the definition of incompetence\" ?\nHere it is: **\"the inabililty to do your job, or things that you are expected to do, successfully\"** _(Cambridge Dictionary © Cambridge University Press)_\nPlease note that I didn't say \"_name-nickname is incompent_\". And even if, I would have not said \"he is an idiot\". I'd have only stated that they weren't able to do their job successfully, ie. referring to **what the whole topic was about**.\n\n* \"They don't even know what they're doing\" ?\nThis was basically the main **topic's title**.\nAnd, I don't see the insult, since it's an evaluation (by me) of what is happening. My opinion, you can disagree, and that's all. No \"harassment or insults\", as everyone can see, as for _thousands_ of similar posts in the past.\n\n* \"sugarcoat\" ?\nPlease :D I even had to look for this way of saying in a common english dictionary (I'm not english native), and it's just an harmless metaphor, perfectly describing what is happening from my point of view. No way it can be classified as \"harassment and insults\".\n\n\n\nSo? What happened?\nIt happened that this \"Moderator\", J., **failed** once again, as for the many cases in the past weeks or months.\nJust to be accurate, another Mod **denied** that something was wrong with the Moderation team: \"[occasional moderation mistake](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/himHYFyl-my-post-was-deleted-for-lack-of-effort?comment=00050000)\".\n\n**But**, one more mistake could have been overlooked and forgiven.\n\nThe problem is that, **the censorship looks intentional, and the deliberate twisting of the Board Rules too**.\n\n# == Part 2. ==\nIn fact, I re-posted my comment, explain how who failed in removing it (J.) should have been more careful about abusing his powers just because disagreeing with other users' opinions.\n\n   \n>  Someone in the Mod team failed again.\n>     Whoever you are, you can't censor users, trying to accuse them of violating the rules. \"Incompetence\" is not an insult, is a judgment; and I motivated it. You don't agree with my opinion? That's a personal issue of yours. Inexperience is not an excuse, in this case.\n> \n>     Therefore, I'm gonna repost my irresponsibly deleted comment, and I ask once again to the actual competent Mods to get rid of the oblivious, biased and overall detrimental ones.\n> \n>     > Indeed. That's basically the definition of incompetence. They don't even know what they're doing.\n>     >\n>     > Or, maybe, they know, and just try to \"sugarcoat\" their terrible philosophy about what's left of this game.\n\nAnd here again, another guy from the Mod Team (U.) intentionally twisted the Rules that he himself should take care of.\nHe removed my comment again, disregarding the fact that the previous Mod already had abused his powers, and applied a **\"3-day suspension\" to my Boards account**. \n\nA **3-day ban**, to cover up another **Moderator's mistake**.\nThat means, it probably wasn't a mistake, and it hasn't been a double mistake neither, with that second wrong action: this looks like **censorship**, mod tools and powers **abuse**, and overall **harassment** towards one Board user.\n\n\nI'm not sure that anyone in the Moderation team can explain this shameful events, but I would be glad in case.\nAs I said [19 days ago](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/himHYFyl-my-post-was-deleted-for-lack-of-effort?comment=000500000000):\n_\"it's not occasional, and I'd suggest to act quickly.

Of course not.

Very indirect too.\n\nLet's talk about incompetence, then. Beyond the tepid repetition of the dictionary definition, we should understand what \"incompetent\" means in a social context.

Lacking a quality or characteristic that\n2. prevents the completion of a task or activity\n3. in an accurate, complete and/or timely manner.\n\nI have issues with your use of the term in all three aspects, but it's the third that's the most problematic. Your complaint about the ISP, above, is based on objective, mutually agreeable metrics - bandwidth, service outages, etc. The same can't be said about moderation, so when you call us all incompetent, you're basing that entirely on your personal understanding of how moderating the League Boards works and _is intended to work._\n\nWe've noticed two primary responses to this disconnect. Most people respond with some variation of, \"Oh, there must have been a misunderstanding. Can you please clarify?\" Were you one of those people, we could have explained in more detail how personal attacks are corrosive to the community because they lend credence to the idea that personal attacks are okay, one of the few examples of a slippery slope. \"Incompetent\" carries a social meaning that is anything but positive.\n\nThe other response is, of course, \"You did it wrong\", which makes it much more difficult to have a productive conversation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-08T22:04:49.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let me ask you this bluntly: If Riot’s data from surveys and gameplay statistics show that the community wants X, but you disagree personally, does that mean that they are incompetent for implementing X?\n\nDo you have access to that internal data that you can use to assess the reasoning behind changes?\n\nIf you were to take all patches in season 9, count up the number of changes, then compare that number to the number of changes that were  undone or reversed, what percent is that?

It's breaking the rules on purpose, thumbing your nose at authority, and basically daring the mods to mess with you again. Well, guess what? They'll take that dare.

I am a Customer of Riot Games and League of Legends. As a customer I feel that I have every right to point out when I am frustrated with the game. What do I mean exactly ? When I see my client Crashing after I have made a specific update, and I have seen that it crashed for another 200 players indicating the lack of basic regression testing without an apology from Riot I would call that incompetence. \n\nWhen I see that A billion dollar game is removing game mods claiming that there are no resources for it (when they have not done a single thing for it for years) is incompetence for me. I can go on. I don't need data for this. It's my experience as a customer and i have every right to do so. I have every right to complain according to the European Law. \n\nDon't forget that League of Legends owe everything to the players, without the players League is nothing. League was created as a game for the players.\n\n> Upon what basis are you basing your claim they are incompetent?\n\nUpon the basis that the game is crashing. Bugs are left to grow for years. \nUpon the basis that hundreds of complaints are made daily.\n\n\n> Is it because you disagree with their way of doing things? \n\nNo, it is because I the game is crashing for an unreasonably long time and there are so many bugs left unattended for years without anyone giving an official statement. \n\n> Why is your opinion of how things should be done the correct one?\n\nWhat opinion? The opinion that  a billion dollar game should function correctly  without crashes and this much bugs?\n\n\n> Why should they listen to your complaint when you did not complain about anything at all? What \"complaint\" can they resolve of \"incompetence\" when you say nothing about why you think they're incompetent? How can they resolve being \"incompetent\" in your eyes when in their eyes and the majority of the community's eyes they are not incompetent?\n\nI think my above responses should suffice.\n\nHope you are satisfied.

And even still, most of those complaints are not issues with Riot client, but with the players internet or computer - not things Riot can fix.\n\nWhat i said here IS accurate. Riot receives complaints via email, reddit, boards, surveys and other inputs. I can guarantee you there are over a 100 complaints every day. Of course not all of them are written some are upvots in the bosrds. Some are comments on youtube. Some are duscussions on reddit. The fact that they are not all technical issues is irrelevant. \n\n\n> You do not have the authority to call them incompetent based on an exaggeration that isn’t even accurate.\n\nEuropean Commercial law begs to differ my friend. If a service or product is not performing to the standards i expect it to perform I have all the right (and blessings) to file a complaint and express my discomfort.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-10T19:20:56.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn’t mean they’re valid complaints.

If they were not valid then the game would be running much smoothly. If the game looks okay to you with your standards, that's fine. If it's not up to the standards for others that's also fine. You can complain. To be precise, the OP in this thread was merely confirming what another person said. \n\n> You can file a complaint but you do not have the right to do so in the manner you choose. \n\nYou can do it in a manner that is civil. Using the word \"incompetence\" is the most civil (but firm ) way to describe a poor performance. People use it in the professional scene as well. It is not considered an insult in any way. \n\n> There is a complaint process and you may contact Riot Support to file one. Riot does not have to allow you to use the boards to do so.\n\nSure there is. One of the ways is by opening a ticket. Another way is posting it on  the boards. At the right place. There are specific sections on the board which are just for that. \n\nP.s. I will stop now as I feel we are both thread-jacking.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2019-12-09T15:37:35.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's ignore any potential violations, regarding the golden rule.\n\nFor a conversation about gameplay, how does this either foster a productive conversation or describe a problem, and (possibly) discuss a potential solution?

Also, if it is that bad, offering suggestions for solutions to the problems, would help facilitate a **discussion** about them.\n\nWithout at least one of those, I agree with the moderation action.
