That makes sense.\n\nHOWEVER, there are 2 hidden nerfs on Taliyah&#039;s W (&quot;Seismic Shove&quot;).\n\n--------------------\n\n1) It is slower than before, as the spell starts only after a direction has been chosen adding a human input delay. \n\nI remember the developer who originally designed this skill said that one of the reasons for W to have such a long pop up time was because the actual timer would start as soon as people clicked the skill. \n\nTHIS IS NO LONGER TRUE. So now we are stuck with the old casting time + the human input delay.\n\n Considering your original purpose was to make her more accessible to more people, this change does exactly the opposite thing. If you don&#039;t believe me check for the % of times people actually land the W now compared to before.\n\n--------------------\n\n2) Max range casting is now very unreliable. It would never happen before with the old way, but now the ability can actually FIZZLE or make her walk before casting it.\n\nThis means that sometimes when casting it at max range it will fizzle out and i&#039;m not even sure why it happens. I think it might be because I move out of range after i start the cast? \n\n\n--------------------\n\nThe solution I propose:\n\nFor SMART CASTING: Make the cast start as soon as you PRESS &quot;W&quot; wherever your mouse is at, in case the mouse is outside of the casting range make it cast it at **max range from Taliyah&#039;s current position**.\n\nBasically having the cast start as soon as you press W at the mouse position (or closest to it in case of out of range) will remove the extra delay, releasing W will pick the direction towards where the mouse is pointing RELATIVE TO WHERE it was originally clicked at. this way people who want to pop up just have to tap it, while people who want to pop in a direction just have to press W, move mouse in the direction (past a certain buffer for the pop up version) release W.\n\n\nFor NORMAL CASTING: Make the cast start as soon as you CLICK the mouse. (the max range thing is not needed here because people actually want it to start where they are clicking it at)\n\n\n\nPS: I actually play on the Japanese servers, so I have to use this low level account to be able to post on these forums.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2016-07-14T21:33:09.002+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"Hi! \n\nYou're spot on about both of these things: there is now a human input delay to how long it takes you to draw the arrow and release your mouse, and out of range casting is no longer clamped. These are both tradeoffs that come along with the concept of vector casting.\n\nWe could change these; arguably we could even do exactly what you propose (although clamping a vector cast is not trivial from a \"read the player's intention\" point of view: if you draw the arrow at an angle that's not 0 or 180 degrees and we transpose your origin point to be closer to you, do we transpose the displacement vector or do we adjust the angle such that the target still goes from the origin point to where you drew your arrow to? That is to say, do we conserve DIRECTION or TARGET POSITION? There is no correct answer here and either way someone would feel the game screwed them). This would be a decent amount of technical behind the scenes work (the game has a very limited number of targeting types and making a new one is a fair bit of work), but more importantly, one of the secondary goals of switching Taliyah W to vector cast has been to reduce the number of different spell casting paradigms in the game. My Taliyah 1.0 W casting paradigm was \"vector casting but not really\"; one of the big gains we made toward learnability of the game as a whole in 6.14 has been to reduce that down to just vector casting. If we did \"vector casting but it's clamped and the delay starts with your first input\" we'd be going back to \"vector casting but not really\".\n\nYou're also right in that this change makes Taliyah harder to learn and master, which was not our goal, but at this point we're talking about an overflowing sink on the Titanic. Sure that's a problem, but we've got much bigger problems that ALSO cause there to be some water damage. Between her Q, her R, and the pathing required to optimize P she's just a super hard champion to learn. I'd love for that to change, but there's always a hundred things you'd love to be the case for your champion, and in this case, wanting more players to be able to play and enjoy her *at all* was the more important consideration.\n\nIn summary, I hear you on your concerns and we will continue to listen and adjust as necessary. I think the W change has showed that when we're wrong, we'll admit we're wrong and fix things as best we can. Please continue trusting us that we have the best interests of our players in mind here.","replies":[{"poster":"Athina","date":"2016-07-14T21:54:51.899+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still think you were correct when you made the original Seismic Shove.

I also thought it had to do something around the homogenization of skills. It's certainly easier when they behave alike for several champions. \n\nI can't tell what would be a good solution if making spell cast start when W is pressed goes against the vector casting paradigm... I wish the timings could be adjusted accordingly but that might be even harder since 1) people have different mechanical skills, 2) reducing the cast time of the ability will make it more frustrating for enemies to evade. This is why i really support what would be a mix of the original design with vector casting.\n\nAbout the max range issue, i think its not that subjective. A player is used to click and drag to define position + popping direction. So calculating the direction from the position of where the player clicked and dragged as if the spell was casted there, and then translating that direction to the max range would seem the most natural way. Put in other words, Taliyah's W has always felt (at least for me) as \"start the seismic shove at a certain position, then make the shove go in \"this direction\" relative to where i started the shove\". Kind of seeing the whole seismic shove as a live object. Which is the same principle of vector casting, a source point with a directional arrow relative to this source. Not a point that defines position, and another point that defines direction.\n\nBut anyways, thanks for replaying.

Most of the Taliyah mains, such as my self, don't even want to play her anymore. When people look at Taliyah, they expect her to be a hard champion to learn, making her \"easier\" won't do the trick. If you learn a hard champion you expect a good reward, like lots of damage or lots of cc, but with the nerfs when you finally manage to land a w the damage just feels lack luster.

The issue here is that Taliyah's W does not function the same way the other vector cast skills do. It has a very small area of effect, with the directional input determining where the enemy goes after the skill activates rather than where the skill goes. This makes the skill very hard to land using vector casting (even for experienced players) when compared to the others (i.e. Equalizer, Death Ray). It also confuses newer players who are expecting the skill to travel in that direction, only to find that the directional input only matters if the enemy was in that small circle to begin with. I would suggest that at the very least, the initial cast should start the skill immediately (almost like the old way, but click-and-drag instead of double-click). That way, the skill can keep vector casting while allowing the player to react to how the placement of their W will affect the rest of their engagement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legendskiller76","date":"2016-07-16T13:41:01.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look how taliyah winrate dropped.

The W vector cast feels literally terrible, I have never had more problems landing one ability in the game more than this one. It makes no sense. It doesn't feel fluid. I've lost all confidence I have in playing this champion because of this change. How is that fair? Some people put in the work an the effort to learn this champion and now I don't even have fun playing her anymore. I don't even care about the damage nerfs, they are fine, nerf her damage if you have too. Just change her W back to the way it was cast. \n\nObviously the person who designed this champion knew what they were doing, to go against HIS thoughts and change the way a spell works because of the community saying that she's hard to play and her W feels clunky, they do not know what they are talking about. Why did you not get in touch with people who have lots of games on her who can truly give you some honest feed back.\n\nYes the E-W combo was a lot of damage, nerf it if you need to, but what's the point in nerfing her damage if you can't land the W because of it's weird casting.\n\nI'm sorry Riot, but this needs reverting, otherwise someone I and not only me, people who put a lot of effort into this champion, will no longer player her, because you wanted to please everybody. It's absolutely horrible to use and I hope you do something about it, or just delete her from the game because it's terrible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeregrineTypeR","date":"2016-07-14T03:45:21.520+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm so disappointed, I'm a lvl 7 tali main and I was really excited for these changes because the w always felt clunky.

That's why playing with Smart Cast on it sucks, you'll be better off playing on Normal Cast.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"inplane","date":"2016-07-14T03:01:38.281+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I thought the changes you suggested WERE the changes they planned.

I don't want to knock people back in so they gain some distance to kill us. Take someone like Vlad for instance. You do NOT want him closer to you, but at the same time you need him to stay somewhere close to your cast range. You simple knock him up so you get a clear shot at him.\n\nThe whole point of her W is to use it creatively like a person who can control the Earth would. You had the choice to knock people through your rocks or to just knock up/gain distance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-07-14T05:59:22.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Maybe because you want to use it as a pseudo-stun/help your allies when they have specific aim-abilities that would be messed up if you threw them out of the way?\nIt's called thinking beyond just herself.
