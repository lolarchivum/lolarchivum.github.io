According to Riot, the ONLY reason this was even changed, was to encourage \"creativity\" okay? Where exactly did the old runes and masteries NOT encourage that? It was nothing BUT creative and more importantly, you were in CONTROL of a much larger system.\n\nIt was centered around letting you buy each individual rune and set points you could set in the mastery tree. Now, in Riot's eyes somehow it's more efficient, to just mush it up like a bunch of mash potatoes, and make it convenient for the simple minds. \n\nIronically, this reminds me a ton of what happens to Diablo 3. To reinforce what I mean, they also skewerd the old system where you could allocate points into a skill tree system, and turned it into some casual style bullshit system. Ironically losing fans.  \n\nIronic right? \n\n\nTake a look at the example below of the old runes. How does any of this look like it needed more \"freedom\" ? \n\nhttp://i66.tinypic.com/nv7byv.png\n\n\n\nAllocating points into specific trees, allowed the player to feel more informed of what they could accomplish. Not to mention the skill tree had actually LESS absurdity to the base damage of things like Thunder lords vs Electrocute now. \nhttp://i64.tinypic.com/904tp5.jpg\n\n\nNow you have this fisher price garbage quality system, which actually is resulting in more problems in the balance department than anything the last system had.

(18 points for a keystone which means you had to be at least level 18 to even stand a chance and the 12 remaining points were scattered between the other two paths)\n\nyes they could have rewarded rune pages, but then that defeats the entire purpose of choosing runes yourself and still prevents a new player from using their own strategy and skill to overcome their opponent. riot tried to limit the runes in the marketplace, but there were still unique runes that players were using from events and in order to use level 3 runes you had to be a certain level. they tried getting rid of level 1's and using level 2's as a way for lower level players to get used to the runes system by only charging 1 IP each, but it still didnt change the fact that players were investing their earned in game currency into a system that was essentially pay or play to win.\n\nthere's a chart somewhere that shows how much of a difference a good expensive set of runes made from a cheap set that was built piece by piece. i refuse to go look for it because the new rune system has flooded google and i dont feel like i need to show it since it's obvious that 5% lifesteal at level 1 combined with 3% from doran blade/or a machete made certain junglers able to sustain through pretty much anything. this of course affected who could and couldnt jungle. penetration was rampant because if you could deal true damage level 1 why wouldnt you? it was more about who had the better runes than it was about who knew how to build their champ. and since you couldnt change that after you joined a lobby you were stuck with being at a disadvantage from the champ select screen.\n\nyes you had the option of changing up masteries, but you couldnt change runes. they both did the same thing with runes giving you flat stats and masteries giving you unique effects like thunderlords and windspeakers blessing. so now you get your flat stats from your combination (sorcery+___, etc.) and you get your unique effects from the runes. and it's all free. a level 1 can be just as good as a level 30 if they know what's OP. this is more \"pure\" from both a marketing standpoint and a gameplay standpoint if the game is to be truly competitive.\n\nyou still have to reach level 30 to play ranked. that's more than enough of an adequate gauntlet for a new player to grasp the concepts of the game. mobas arent as uncommon as they used to be and with twitch, beam, and youtube among other stream sites showcasing a ton of esports most new players of todays time have a decent understanding of the basics. they may not know the meta and if they're a casual player they'll have a hard time with the game in general, but there's more to this game than just climbing ranked ladders. \n\nsticking a pointless grind into a free to play game based on the assumption that players wont know how to play is not only asinine, but looks shady from a business point of view. it makes it seem like you're just milking new players for RP so they dont have to grind. the lure of these types of games is the constant content and the competition. everything else is fluff to support the developers. why do you think costumes like elementalist lux cost $30?\n\nwould you rather a company rely on forcing players to skip the grinding process in order to go straight to competitive mode for their income or on their cosmetics? me personally i'd rather it be the cosmetics.","replies":[{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2018-07-16T13:56:41.416+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why not just unlock all runes/rune slots for all players, and grant access to all 30 points in masteries right when a player starts?

I mean, back in the day you would maybe be able to tell what masteries someone took, but for the most part it didn't matter because they were just small little bonuses that each player specifically chose to make their laning/late game/etc. easier.

Not saying the new one is flawless, but the old one definitely had a lot of core design problems that made changes to it necessary.\n\nThe biggest difference between the new and old system is the way choices are made. In the old rune system, you had an almost overwhelming amount of choices, yet not a single of them felt impactful on its own. Sure, you could probaly feel the difference between a full armor rune page + a fully defensive mastery page and a fully offensive rune + mastery page, but the individual choices were barely noticeable. Let's compare:\n\nIn the new system, you pick 5 runes. That means you will have 5 choices in total in pregame for runes and masteries. Every single one of these choices can clearly be felt in-game. Versus:\n\nIn the old system you had 30 runes total, and your masteries gave you 30 points to put in the mastery trees. This means the old system had 60 individual choices, yet not a single one felt individually impactful in game, except maybe for the Keystone you picked. \n\nConsidering that you also have to choose role, champion, summoner spells and skin in the pregame, I think you could easily make the argument that the old system had too many choices that didn't feel interesting or impactful at all.

Keystones were considered hard to balance and were likely on of the key balance nightmares for the game overall (league of Thunderlords for example).\n\nRunes Reforged has the same general format of the reworked masteries, and the same balance nightmare of the Keystone masteries in the Keystone Runes.\nThe real advantage is the single interface for the pre-match calibration.\n\nSince Runes Reforged has been released, I've actually perused my pages to make changes before a match starts - instead of finding my \nchamp-n-role-specific mastery page and generic rune page with the obvious optimal calibration.\n\nRunes Reforged has issues - many inherited from the Keystone power balance issue.\nBut its definitely simpler, sleeker, and easier to use as a pre-game mechanic for the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2018-07-16T11:37:04.069+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"You were in control\", \"More customization\", \"More options\"\n\n*Proceeds to copy the runes and masteries with best winrate on op.gg*","replies":[{"poster":"UpDownLeftRightAB","date":"2018-07-17T03:42:18.426+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's easier to copy someone else than do their own homework.\nI mean, they must be right.

Old runes and masteries actually had less freedom than the new runes. If you were adc all you got was a bit of ad runes and only attack speed runes. If you were a tank, you only got health runes. No matter what adc you played, you would get the same runes as every other adc. No matter what tank you played, you got the same runes as every other tank. \n\nThis also applies to all the other classes and because of the fact there was only one rune setup that was the best, they might as well been bonus stats for these champions. That’s why when runes reforged came, they gave all the champions the stats they had from their old rune pages for free by putting them directly into the champion. \n\nAs for masteries, well that was even a bigger mess. In each branch one mastery was far better than the rest and the only reason you would not pick that one best mastery would be if that mastery was not good for your champ. \n\nAt least when I play an adc now with the new runes, I get to keep asking myself “Do I want to go into sorcery for more damage, or do I want inspiration to play safer?”","replies":[{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2018-07-16T14:00:10.399+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except they didn't give those champs those stats for free-- what happened to the +9 armor I would run on all my mages?

How does any of this look like it needed more \"freedom\" ?\n\nWell.....\n\nThe dirty secret is that there was a right runepage. I know, I know, people are going to despise me for saying it but Runes were solved since...well, Season 3 or so. Now, of course, there's going to be that guy who tells me \"But hey hang on what about my 1% crit/extremely niche page I went in 1 out of every thousand match-ups?\" Sure, those existed, but by-and-large they were not common nor picked all that often. Most situations had you run the same/similar runes on most types of champs. Scaling MR, flat armor, Armor Pen/Magic Pen in most cases. Two rune pages could carry you through everything.\n\nSame deal with masteries. Oh sure, there was always that guy who proclaimed his 10/10/9 mastery set-up was the secret op. You know what we did with that guy? We wrote him off as a lunatic because it was a bad choice. In almost all situations, you always wanted the exact same masteries depending on AP/AD Damage, Tank/Bruiser or Support. \n\nAre runes right now perfect 100% the BEST REPLACEMENT EVER? No, they still need work and some choices/trees need a bit more flavor. However, old runes and masteries -were- a problematic system that needed more than number changes. \n\n(Additionally, if you really left it up to me? Fuck it, get rid of all pre-game systems and just make it about in-game and nothing else.)","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-07-17T02:12:42.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in favor of the fuck it comment. Way easier balancing. \n\nHowever I did have and used regularly 13 rune pages for riven. And I am fairly certain that most riven players had more then 1 rune page for her. (maybe it's just riven) but most champions would swap out mr for flat HP or scaling HP yellows depending on the matchup. You would have some mages which would also swap out cdr blues for AP blues depending on the matchup. Also there were a few things which were so similar in power that it depended on personal preference. Like scaling ad and flat ad. (Became even at level 6 and scaling was better after) neither was a bad choice but of course flat ad gave you a much better lane. But scaling on a safe laner like cait or something was super good also. \n\n\nRunes may have been cracked. But the rune pages actually swapped around alot as people and the meta changed. And the difference between a subpar rune page and a cracked rune page was pretty minimal. (think taking armor seals instead of scaling HP in midlane) the scaling HP was slightly better later in the game. But armor was better early for the ranged aa harass. \n\nAlso. Taking a subpar rune page now is significantly more damaging then it used to be. So for example riven, if you take electrocute toplane your going to lose if your opposing laner isn't completely braindead. (or a squishy ranged matchup) but if you take that shit into renekton you just lose, hard.  Vs taking any of the 'good runes' which into renekton is either Aftershock or grasp. Because after you proc electrocute he just kills you. If you can't 100-0 with that choice you just lose.
