I&#039;ve reviewed the kit, artwork, gameplay, and here&#039;s what I see:\r\n\r\n1) The rework puts into balance her most broken feature: \r\n\r\nHer healing.\r\n\r\nThe current and last version of Akali was healing far too much off her Passive Twin Discipline/Kamas. Moving the heal onto her W makes this far more manageable.\r\n\r\n2) Mobility is now about more than just chasing.\r\n\r\nHer smoke screen is now a dash beacon, and her Kama throw is now a dashing mark. In other words, she can now play multi dimensionally to make up for her reduced heals. I love this, because it can potentially give her a strong escape if you place her smoke screen, Shuriken it, and kill someone with R, and then E back to the smoke screen. It has extremely high potential for outplay potential. I cannot stress how versatile this change is. It&#039;s almost like a Pyke kit on mobility.\r\n\r\n3) Her Ult. It&#039;s now an aoe, deals different damage types, and more importantly, is NOT infinitely castable if she kills someone. That&#039;s far more balanced.\r\n\r\n4) Her Stealth change:\r\n\r\nI know a lot of players see a blaring concern about the new smoke cloud: It makes her completely obscured while in it.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n-It has a diminishing effective area over time which allows people to reliably skill shot her if they shimmer her, or just guess. It means she&#039;s going to have a potential turret harass, but it also means skill shot champs will be MUCH more deadly to her.\r\n\r\n5) Visual: Omfg..... I don&#039;t know how ANYONE could argue the new splashes/in game model look ugly. They&#039;re gorgeous. Period. One of Riot&#039;s best artists drew these and really did homage to her. Even classic looks gorgeous.\r\n----------------\r\nI think it&#039;s probably going to be one of the most successful reworks for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Akali has no inherent invulnerability buttons. She&#039;s still squishy and practical to play against, and has the weakness of needing targets to use her skills.\r\n2) Her kit&#039;s going to have a medium - high skill mastery.\r\n3) Her heals are down, meaning her play is going to rely more on skill.\r\n4) Her reset capacity is reduced, meaning less perma snowballs. Meanwhile, her kit will still be impactful.\r\n5) It&#039;s still a powerful kit.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2018-07-17T00:22:50.037+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"I think it's just another overloaded CertainlyT kit that will prove impossible to properly balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-07-17T00:37:03.102+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":12,"body":"Nah.

Take every most hated thing league has and make zoe out of them. Broken kit that cant be balanced. She is either shits on everything or gets shit on by everyone.

Proceed to shit on him with mobility creep and then pretend he does not exist. \nHe also was insanely broken for a while. After \"balancing\" him he became what is considered a weak champion. Do you see a pattern here? His champions cant be fucking balanced properly. They either a complete cancer or nonviable. \n\n> - Has a high smurfing profile, but generally is not a skilled queue champion.\n\nRanged champion that becomes more tanky than many bruisers without buying a single defensive item. \nBut i would say he is more on the balanced side.

It doesn't matter if it's level 6 or level 18. But, you have Gunblade far before something like level 12, and not too long after level 6, so using level 6 is an easy benchmark.\n\nI'm using Gunblade to compare them BECAUSE IT'S A STAT GIVING ITEM WHICH ALSO BOOSTS HER PASSIVE. It's 80 AP and AD, both which scale her passive heal (not just her friggin 15% from the Gunblade passive). 80 AP + 40 AD rune AP + any other items' AD+AP all feed into her passive. With just a Gunblade, her passive does a 86 Heal. If you look at Gunblade's damage on components of her kit, with just a Gunblade, she gains 15% on Q, 15% on Passive second hit, 5% on E, and 15% on R. Most of those components at just a Gunblade only deals about 100-115 damage.\n\nSo..... all in all from blowing her kit once, Gunblade only gives about 55.25 heals from the entire combo.... when the passive gives 86.\n\nAt level 18 with {{item:3146}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}} , she has:\n\n153 AD and 660.8 AP pre drakes/baron.\n\nThat's a heal of 375.24 from her passive.\n\nLet's get generous and give her 1 second hit passive, 2 Q's, 1 E, and 2 R's at this build on Gunblade heals:\n\n92.5 from Passive\n56.91 from Q part 1 X2\n71.325 X2 from Mark detonations on auto attacks.\n30.93 from E.\n57.2 X 2 from R\n\nSo if she blows almost her entire kit TWICE.... she has 494.27 heals from Gunblade.\n\nNow.... to get off all those skills (with only 10% CDR)..... takes .... \n\nat least 7.2 seconds for the Q's\n\nIn other words..... in the time it takes you to use this combo, Passive heal procs TWICE, for a total of 750.8 Heals.\n\nAnd if you take away the second Q;\n\nYou lose Mark damage #2, Q damage #2.\n\nWhich brings your single combo 2 ult heal from Gunblade down to 366.025 heals.\n\n\nWhich means..... for all that gaff and use of skills..... The heal for using Gunblade for ALL skills in 6 seconds ALWAYS is slightly less from the Gunblade than from the passive on Auto from her passive. (375.24 vs 366.025, or 750.8 vs 492.27)\n\nThere is not a universe in the game where the passive is a \"crappy heal.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2018-07-20T10:44:46.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i see, that's the misunderstanding.\nI'll reply more when i get home","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elf0491","date":"2018-07-17T17:53:11.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we haven't seen a lot of the numbers that will be going with this kit, I still disagree with several of your points, and am not a fan of the rework at all.\n\n1. In terms of healing, I really didn't think it was that broken. As someone else already mentioned, most of her ridiculous healing came from gunblade rather than her passive. Furthermore, since we don't know how much healing she can actually get off of her W, we really can't say whether it will be more or less. It's an unknown at this point.\n\n2. Her kit does seem to have vastly increased mobility, so I recognize that, though I am so looking forward to having my kama be minion blocked, and thereby not activating her passive, so say goodbye to half of her mobility right there. My bigger problem is the cost this is going to come at. I enjoyed playing Akali in part because she was simple and straightforward. Now she is neither of those things, and it feels like Riot has just taken another champion and pushed their skill floor out of reach of most LoL players, just for the sake of 'excitement.' And that really annoys me.\n\n3. I am intrigued by her ult, but also concerned. It looks like it has short range, but her kit also has more mobility. I'm also concerned that the cooldown could really hurt her, and vastly reduce her potential to actually assassinate people.\n\n4. This is the part of Akali's kit that seems way strong. I'm sure you've heard why, since everyone seems to be talking about it, so I won't say it all again. Just point out that skill shot champs aren't strong against this. They're better than targeted abilities, but especially with the smoke expanding to a ring, if you can't reveal her, you're chances of hitting her drastically decrease (as opposed to her old, static circle).\n\n5. Visually, I'm still kinda upset. Her splash arts, especially on her plain skin, absolutely look amazing! I was super excited about the tattoos especially. Then I saw her in game model... she looks like some teenage anime character. And maybe that's what Riot was going for, in which case, that's a dumb decision. She should look like an assassin, and right now she looks like a kid. She needs to look older, and have a darker color scheme.\n\n6. One final thing I'll add (I might think of other things later): Again, not knowing the numbers on her abilities, I can't say for certain, but it seems like any semblance of wave clear has been totally removed from her kit. crescent slash+sustain is what made her viable in lane, and now she has neither of those things, and doesn't appear to have any great replacements.\n\nShort version: I'll certainly keep an eye on her and try her out, but her in-game visuals need help, and I'm really not excited about what they did to one of my more liked champs. Doesn't seem to feel like her at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-07-17T21:20:12.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Her healing was the problem. No other champions running {{item:3146}} was pulling 30% self HP recovery in a single ability. Akali was/is. Go test it. Her passive heal is MASSIVE. 5-60 + 60% AD and 45% AP. If Akali has just a {{item:3146}} alone, that's about 14 + 51 + 50.4 = 114 heal at level 6. The heal from {{item:3146}} at that stage will only heal her 18 from Q, 14. \n\n114 heals versus 32. There's no comparison. Late game, the numbers may get closer together as basics/marks gain more damage from {{item:3100}} , but her Passive is why she's so strong.\n\nYou can literally grievous wounds her and she will still heal 15% hp per Passive proc.\n\n2) They have a developing footprint of making champions more complex to challenge players. I don't see that as a problem, as long as they still have counterplay.... after all, players have had up to 8 years to get used to very basic, old kits, which are WAY too simple and offer no room for further mastery. To keep league competitive, they DO need to massage your brains and make it more challenging.\n\n3) Nah. While it's short range, the damage is huge, and it's aoe. Her kit also once mastered is going ton enable those quick R bursts. Also, it couples perfectly with her new shroud. She can R from one side of the could to the other twice and essentially pull it off without being targettable.\n\n4) I can guarantee I can hit her 90% of the time with {{champion:34}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:115}} \n\nHer smoke screen is only as large as Darius's Decimate, which should give you an idea of how to avoid and how to hit her.\n\nAnd you can see her.
