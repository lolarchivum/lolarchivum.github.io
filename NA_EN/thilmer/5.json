As well, they completely missed opportunities for say Kled and Ziggs to be in as part of the line as they feel much more fitted to the series.\n\nHOWEVER you can't deny that they do make the skins work. Veigar using a little remote controller for spawning his gate and directing missiles is a perfect way of making him into the series (somehow). Tristana still feels distinct from Guerrilla with the gun, beret, target finder and even a little crazy eye from what I could tell. And Twitch is practically made for this series, you cannot deny that.\n\nCould there have been better candidates for the Omega Squad series? Absolutely, but let's face it. It's Riot. They're the ones that make the decisions and know that the more popular champs will sell more skins and make more of a profit to them.
