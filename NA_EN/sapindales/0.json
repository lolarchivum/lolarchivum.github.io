I agree that a player's person should never be taken into conversation; however, telling someone that they are bad at a _**computer game**_ should not be ban-worthy. If my teammate is feeding, then I'd hope they were capable of listening so that we could improve their lane. \r\n\r\nThe report system in this game allows anyone who has had their feelings hurt to subject the other player to a random algorithm, that ultimately decides based off of statistics and analyses that are ran on the game's chats. If you get your feelings hurt because someone called you out for feeding, let this poorly designed algorithm decide if they deserve to have a chat ban, suspension, or their account deleted. It's completely ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the algorithm is Riot's drive to maintain inexpensive game management and upkeep; just like everything else, it's revolving around Riot's profits.. Players assume that Riot has this absurd banning system in place because they want to protect the hurt feelings, innocent tears, and fragile egos of overly-sensitive league players; but really, it's just a crappy, profit driven company that doesn't care who is getting unfairly penalized. This game should reach equilibrium with every other video game, where players are allowed to type in chat without getting slapped with bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-12-20T15:05:33.699+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the right to lose a game without being called a \"fucking idiot\" by my team.

This is a horrendously common (and absurd) misconception that a lot of people have.\n\n\n##If you get punished, it's very likely NOT because someone had their feelings hurt and reported you, it's because they felt like you were being a dick, reported you, and the system agreed.\n\nSure, there are going to be cases where it does involve people's feelings, but the majority of the time, I'm willing to bet people are just wanting to be done with you and prevent other players from having to put up with your BS.\n\n> let this poorly designed algorithm decide\n\nIt caught you, didn't it?

All of that third paragraph is you just railing against the people who reported you, calling them \"over-sensitive\" (as is the point of this post, I assume), and railing against Riot for your assumption that they're so focused on money that they don't care about the community as a whole.\n\nThey do care, by the way, which is why they developed the IFS.
