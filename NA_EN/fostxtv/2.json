There are three main problems that need to be addressed with him at this point:\n\n* **He's far too difficult to pick up.** Unlike practically every other champion, which can be played with at least moderate success from the get-go, Azir has extremely low win rates up until you reach the top tiers of elo and games played. He needs to be made easier to learn, even if he still ends up more difficult than the average champion, and keeps a sky-high skill ceiling.\n* **He's far too safe in the right hands:** When played to near-perfection, Azir turns into a lane bully on top of being a hypercarry, and doesn't put himself in as much risk as would be expected from an autoattacker mage. One part of the issue is his Q, which gives him a pretty large amount of poke damage when combined with a W auto, but the major issue is his dash: either he uses it as an escape, which isn't appropriate for a mage like him, either he uses it to dash to his target, which he shouldn't be doing anyway as a squishy non-Slayer champion. I feel there is honestly no place for mobility in his kit, and it might be better to replace his E with something else.\n* **He's still extremely buggy:** There's still a heap of technical issues with Azir's soldiers and, above all, his wall, that need to be addressed. One issue comes from his wall pinning enemies to terrain, and I think it should a) simply stop enemies in their tracks, instead of knocking them back, and b) consistently push enemies over terrain, instead of sandwiching them for what amounts to a 3-second stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-11-06T18:23:35.114+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just interjecting here about your first point; skill-floor and skill-ceiling should have no bearing on champion design and balance.

While it's okay for some champions to be more difficult to pick up than others, there's a limited window of acceptable skill floors and skill ceilings. If your champion's skill ceiling is too low, you end up with someone like Garen, who offers little real long-term mastery and cannot be made too popular outside of lower elos. If your champion's skill floor is too high, the discrepancy between their competitive and standard performance becomes far too high, which also makes them impossible to balance properly, as has been the case with Azir, Kalista and now Shen.\n\nTo be clear, I have no issue with Azir being more difficult to pick up than the average champion, and I certainly don't think any champion's skill ceiling should be lowered if that can be avoided. The problem right now is that Azir's skill floor is so high that he's only truly worth committing to if you're a pro-level player, which isn't right.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=UltimaFatum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mjKQMgHw,comment-id=000e0000,timestamp=2016-11-06T18:23:35.114+0000)\n> \n> My personal opinion is that Q offers too much burst and utility.

Leave the pierce-through damage as a core identity of Orianna&#x27;s ball, and remove it from Azir so that they control the battlefield in distinct ways from one-another, as otherwise their designs compete for &quot;the best zone-control mage&quot;.\n\nThis I can largely agree with. If Azir's Q offered CC but no damage, it would be a great way of repositioning his soldiers and pinning enemies down for a few extra shots, but would no longer allow him to deal 110% AP's worth of poke in one go. In fact, it could even allow his Sand Soldiers to deal more damage per attack, as he'd have practically no burst to speak of.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-11-06T22:17:02.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Again to your first point - you're being hyperbolic. People at a platinum skill level can play Azir with relative ease if they commit to him. Similar to Aurelion Sol, Fiora or Gangplank - they all have a high skill floor but saying only pro players can ever hope to access their power is just flat out wrong. They all require commitment to learn, but they are not so innately complex that they cannot be used by anyone other than Faker.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-11-06T23:21:42.024+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think I'm being all that hyperbolic, his win rate hovers a little above 40% across all elos and at most levels of experience. By contrast, even the likes of Aurelion Sol, Fiora and Gangplank have win rates closer to the 45-55% bracket, and scale at least slightly more smoothly with mastery, even if Aurelion and GP still have an issue with high-level play. It truly isn't worth picking up Azir unless you're willing to suffer an unusually large amount of losses. The flipside to this is that, when Faker uses him, he suddenly starts doing things he should not be allowed to do, i.e. bully opponents in lane and become almost impossible to gank. There objectively is a problem with Azir, and that problem is tied to his issues with accessibility and mastery scaling.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2016-11-06T23:16:21.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} does not pin people with his ult to a terrain for a while now, they removed this interaction like REALLY long time ago, now he knocks you over the terrain OR over the wall itself, if the terrain does not allow that (ie. is too thick or is an edge of the map).","replies":[]}]}]}
