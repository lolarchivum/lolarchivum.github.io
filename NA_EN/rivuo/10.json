Likewise, a duo+ can just decide one of them will take the hit in lost games while playing on a smurf so that the other doesn't have to. It's a huge gaping hole for exploitation.

Before that point, kill gold is worth multiple minion kills. Even if your CSing is on point, a champion that has been fed 7 kills is still gonna be ahead by a large margin, and when your team mates have exhausted their value, the enemy team is free to take objectives while you're busy trying to farm up some kind of lead so you can stop them and maybe push back. Reducing kill gold would make it easier to catch up fed enemies in gold. As it is now, when you get a 1 kill per 30 second game, the only thing you can do is ff. You are never gonna be able to farm enough to catch up before they take your nexus. The only exception is when you have a tanky team and some wave clear where you can stall the game but that is rare.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-10-25T21:09:13.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but that doesnt change the fact that its wasting your time and you don't get to try. at least make it less worse.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keylight XD","date":"2016-10-27T02:35:43.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Signed in just to upvote!\nSmart solution to a problem that should had been resolved seasons ago.\n\nI salute you sir, good night!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒoes","date":"2016-10-26T22:05:18.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I've had the same philosophy as you about this.\n\nI was in my series for Silver 5 and in the very last game I was playing (2W/2L), both ADC and support (who were in a premade) disconnected at around the 10 minute mark.
