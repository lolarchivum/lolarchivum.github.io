I suspect that when you get Expose W. in most cases you will lose assassin damage.\n\nBit off on the 7% penetration, which I assume you mean battering blows and piercing thoughts. This is considerably variable. 7% pen vs a target with less than 100 respective resist dosnt get 7% more damage. Where as champs with more than 100 are affected more by this. Infact an ADC with 30 MR has just 2.1 MR penetrated by 7% piercing thoughts.\n\nIm not trying to shit on your point though. I agree that damage creep is a real thing and a bit of a problem... All Im saying is that some of your numbers are a bit fuzzy there.\n\nLastly, because its not a solid analysis of the numbers just some percents thrown up, some not very accurate, we cant have a real discussion on damage creep based on this post. If the number representation isnt accurate, we wont have a red coming in here making a response because like I did, they will have to spend a lot of time unpacking inaccuracies presented... and theyre not going to bother.
