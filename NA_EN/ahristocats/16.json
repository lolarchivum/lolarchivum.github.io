Ever single one of them starts being good the second you bought them. Crit doesn´t start being good the second you bought you first item. It only starts being good once you have 2 items. Your trifoce doesn´t need other items to be good. Your zhonyas doesn´t need other items to be good. Your randuins doesn´t need anything more then a crit user on the enemy team to be good. Let´s also not forget how every single one of these items have passives wich give you utility or more damage. Crit gives you only damage. Every single crit item is purely for the purpose of dealing damage. So quit talking shit all day about how they are far too expensive to some meme Ap Darius build you are butthurt about not working as a adc replacement. I bet you think {{item:3036}} is the reason your 0 tank items Zed got killed by a Caitlyn who got peeled. Like seriously stop talking and quit making yourself look like the fool. Even if it probably is in your peoples blood to do that","replies":[]}]}]}]}
