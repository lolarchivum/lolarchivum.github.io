Maybe that's a champion that seems to work really well with the changes, or itemization strategies to handle the different packs.\n\nI'm a pretty bad jungler, but for me one thing I like to do is keep an eye on the enemy jungler's items. If I see that they're building one of the farming items, then I'll know I might be able to play  a little bit more aggressively for a while. The jungler loses the value of his item if he is forced to come and babysit lanes because my team is applying a lot of pressure.\n\nNow, if the jungler takes one of the items that lets him smite champions item, then I know he's going to be looking to make an early impact on the lanes. Adjust your playstyle accordingly!\n\nEDIT: This was ment to be a discussion about tips for the new jungle, not a balance discussion. Sorry for the confusion!

However, with that said, I hate what they've done to new jungle. I have not been around super long, but implementing this all at once throws everything I liked about Jungle out the window. I liked the way it was, and think it's really annoying that new Summoner's Rift Update was supposed to help current gameplay, not change it. The way it is now, I used to play a lot of Jungle, and I won't be. You've made it so Counter Jungling is even worse. If you get countered, you might as well AFK unless you play a stupid easy champ that's no fun. The way it was worked. Don't fix something that isn't broken. You turned Jungle into a super advanced, overly detailed mess. At this rate, I might as well stop playing League. I like change, but it needs to be done in increments. You shouldn't just take a bunch of ideas and vomit them all over your Playerbase.\n\nThere are soo many things wrong I don't know where to start. First off, making it so we can only buy Jungle items with Smite is not needed. It takes away more freedom from the Player and boxes you in to do what is \"Meant\" to be done. Not the Smiteless Jungle was ever huge for me, but taking away my ability to chose what I want to do hurts over all strategy. You're railroading Players into Meta, or what's accepted.\n\nNext, making small camps more than Gold and XP, then using that as an excuse to double respawns. Terrible. It was hard enough when you can't gank due to whatever reason, now, there's not point to stay in the match if your team can't set up ganks. I know it's a team effort, but I don't want to be penalized as a Jungle Main simply because my Random Team-mates decide they want to keep pushed and not let me gank. Personally, I don't think I should have to stop and wonder: \"What would be most useful to smite? Maybe this, so I can have vision, or perhaps I should smite this for a buff...\" There's no reason to complicate small camps. What next? Does CSing in lane have special effects based on when you do it and what spot in lane the minions die?\n\nThis, I have to make note of because it should be said. Making it so if you die to Jungle camps you don' lose buffs? Come on, that is just silly. If you die to a Jungle Camp, then you messed up and shouldn't keep your buffs. I assume this was done because you made even small camps harder for reasons which I don't know for sure.\n\nOver all, this decision was bad, and it needs to be rethought entirely. Stop shoving Junglers out of their Jungle and into fights, when you force players to do something, you kill diversity even more. Riot, the worst part about League to me and loads of others, is that everyone does one type of thing and corners you into doing certain things to counter that. Stop making it so I have to play specific champions to do well.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-11-20T22:18:44.330+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">First off, making it so we can only buy Jungle items with Smite is not needed. It takes away more freedom from the Player \n\nNo it doesn't. A choice that is always inferior is not really a choice, it's just a trap. Smite was always a better option than other \n\n> Personally, I don't think I should have to stop and wonder: \"What would be most useful to smite?\n\nWhy? It's a choice, and it comes with different rewards attached to each choice. Having the ability to use it for fighting or farming or saving it for securing kills is more interesting than the only choice being \"do I use this on cooldown or am I doing dragon soon?\" Not always having an easily-found best option can be a very good thing.\n\n>It was hard enough when you can't gank due to whatever reason, now, there's not point to stay in the match if your team can't set up ganks. \n\nSure there is. If your teammates are pushing up, go invade the enemy jungle and steal camps while your teammates back you up. If your enemies are pushed under tower, you can force them to either CS there or lose farm if they come to try and stop you. Or, if your teammates are harassing well, you can set up towerdives. Or, if you're an objective-focused jungler, you can use it to force Dragon. Or, you can help one of them take their tower and then have them roam with you. There is always an option of something to do. The only limit is what you are willing to do.\n\n>Stop shoving Junglers out of their Jungle and into fights, when you force players to do something, you kill diversity even more.\n\nFirst, every change forces players to do something because it changes what is rewarded.\n\nSecond, making players interact with each other is good game design. The worst times of jungling have been when afk farming has been the main style. Having someone play without even seeing anyone else for 20 minutes then come out stronger than everyone else is very poor design, and tends to be boring for most people involved.\n\nThird, a major problem with the current problem is lack of diversity because of the way that certain actions are rewarded. The item changes and the increased potential for ganking to be a main income source as opposed to sustained farming actually open up diversity because it means that certain champions will not be rewarded much more for their main style of play than others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2014-11-20T21:17:11.990+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"New jungle has less gold due to the doubled up respawn times, its harder to clear and leaves you more vulnerable.

I'm pretty new to jungle so I find his guidelines very helpful\n\nFor me I'm probably going to stick to Warwick, going to be practicing Elise, maybe playing Rengar, and planning on picking up Pantheon (waiting for the rune sale just to make sure I have enough IP for everything I want). Warwick and Elise have very good sustain (and are champions I own), which is a big concern for me right now (according to Cloth5, Lee Sin even has a tough time clearing early with enough health to gank; this mitigates a huge advantage of Lee Sin since his early ganks are more difficult now). This is also why I'm trying to pick up Pantheon (he can apparently solo dragon at lvl 3; it takes a long time, but if done perfectly he doesn't even take damage. Not that I'm ever going to try a lvl 3 dragon, just using it as an example of his sustain).\n\nAs far as items, I'm tempted to just get Rangers on everyone; perhaps just because it's the most familiar at this point (cooldown is similar to S4 smite, generally it just lets you farm faster and get your items quicker), but I also like having smite up for things like contesting objectives, or smiting important camps (like Raptors, since you get the oracles). Poacher's seems very situational based on what the enemy jungler is, maybe if they're someone who gets very low in their jungle and I'm someone that can 1v1 skirmish really well (ie. I'm Pantheon vs Evelynn), I can punish them, but it takes a lot of map awareness that I haven't really internalized yet (knowing where they can and can't be, when I want to punish, etc). Also you can sort of counter jungle pretty well with Rangers, due to the short cooldown.\n\nThe other two smites are interesting. Skirmisher's runs into an interesting dilemma, where it seems very useful on AA based junglers, but AA based junglers are typically going to build into Devourer and want to be able to farm quickly for their stacks, thus Ranger's is the better option. NB3 goes Skirmisher's on Warwick, on one hand Warwick gets a ton of use out of it because of his ult and being AA reliant, not to mention he doesn't really need the sustain that Ranger's offers, but on the other hand WW's clear speed isn't great. Stalker's might be interesting for champions like Shyvana/Olaf/Skarner (I think) who have trouble with being kited (and also have really good clears/don't need smite for their own jungle) when they're going for ganks, but champions who already had a ton of utility (ie. Elise, Amumu), it isn't as necessary besides making it a little easier to hit skillshots. Another point of consideration for these two smites is that it's really risky if you're going to contest objectives; if you use it in combat, your cooldown for actually using smite on a monster or minion is very very long, which means it's harder to contest dragons and such, which is why I feel like Ranger's is the safest option for most junglers, unless you have really good foresight and manage timers a lot better than I do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kýu","date":"2014-11-20T21:28:42.594+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel EXTREMELY underlevel'd even if i only farm, if i try ganking lanes i ultimately end up too far behind to gank anymore without dying and am forced to go back to farming, remaining behind.\n\nI dont like sitting in the jungle farming all game, its boring.

This jungle is no joking matter.\n\nSome notes:\n\nRaptors seem a little over tuned. I realize this camp has been too easy for a while, but honestly, do they have to absolutely truck you as hard as they do? Compared to the other camps, this one is just suicide, especially for the non-sustain junglers.\n\nYou succeeded in essentially eliminating early ganks. Level 3 ganks aren't possible in any normalized reality without being extremely at risk of dying. This is going to really have a big impact on the roster of junglers across the board, because Lee Sin and others can't snowball off of super early ganks. They have to back, and their clear times in the jungle really aren't great. \n\nPlaying Amumu and Skarner in jungle already, I can say that these are much better picks than the common S4 picks. With Lee Sin and company you either end up with a Level 3 Lee Sin ganking after his back with the laners at level 3/4, or you end up with them waiting and ganking at level 4 or 5 with half health after the rest of a full clear (and after one back already). With Skarner and Amumu (and others), you can gank with 75% or higher health after a back and at level 4 or 5. That's a pretty big advantage.\n\n\nIt's not a bad thing... We are likely to see a landslide shift in who succeeds in this jungle. At least, that's my prediction. Any of the champions without defensive abilities and/or sustain, and have low base stats, are not going to do that great in this jungle. But that's what is going to happen with the changes required to meet the goals in diversity that Riot has been trying for, accentuating the weaknesses of junglers (who may not have even been intended to jungle), and the strengths of others who were (Warwick, Fiddle, Nunu, Skarner, Amumu, etc.).","replies":[{"poster":"Vore Monster","date":"2014-11-20T19:21:19.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't wait to play more of my {{champion:72}}  baby.

A side effect of making the jungle so difficult is that if the jungler falls behind, it's very unlikely that they will catch up. The reason for this is that the clear times of the new jungle (and respawn timers) don't really allow for you to just power farm the jungle.\n\nIn any case, it's more obvious now when a jungler has played poorly, and much more obvious when a jungler has played well.

They have good base stats, do well with defensive runes and masteries (and are generally built this way to begin with), and have good AoE kits and defensive steroids (in two of the cases at least).\n\nFirst hand I can say both Amumu and Skarner will be very strong IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"The McSmashy","date":"2014-11-20T21:00:22.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm Skarner is baller in new jungle.

I'll weight in with a very good general concept as a D4 Jungle main.\n\n1. Does your jungler have a very good lvl 2 that lets them gank if they want?\n  If yes, then they will do just fine and will thrive in the new jungle.\n\n2. Does your jungler scale with lvl's and need lvls before they really come on line?\n If yes, then you are going to have a rough time in the jungle for much longer than you are used to.\n\n3. Can your jungler scale well with items?\n If yes, then the new jungle items no longer drag down your build and if you get rolling you can in fact still carry from the jungle.\n\nPower lvl'ing junglers are no longer a thing as far as I can tell. Unless your ganks on solo lanes get kills you will be roughly 1 to 2 lvls behind the enemy solo lanes at the second buff mark. \n\nHOWEVER, the new jungle items are SO much strong when fighting enemy champs it makes up for some of this and once the game gets rolling if you get enough gold for a decent build after the jungle item... you can really scale great.\n\nNow everything I just said is off of like one day of playing... but,\n\n1. I find that the new jungle force farm junglers to do something else early other than just farm... but rewards then later...\n\n2. Early impact junglers, the ones that can gank lvl 2, are still a thing and are really going to shine.\n\n3. The more pure tank junglers, that can't gank early, and don't have fast clears, have been almost completely pushed out of the jungle.\n\n**Early impact** = J4, Shaco, Lee, Fid, Panth\n\n**Farm Heavy** = WW, Ud\n\n**Tanks** = Amumu, Nunu, Rammus, Sion.\n\nThe above 11 junglers should be the main focus for most people for the time being. they will be impacting games massively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LGC Jairen","date":"2014-11-20T21:54:28.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while i am not my groups main jungler.

After a few games with these changes, I feel like top laners are now more than ever forced to take tp. That first dragon buff stack seems to be more important than most of the other buff from dragon aside from the 5th stack in terms of effect on fights. Say top lane is relatively equal, but the other team obtained the first dragon stack, top lane match up would shift towards the side with the dragon stack despite no effort or involvement of the top lane in getting that bonus (easily a free 360 gold value [long sword] for the first stack per person) and they do not need to back to use that bonus. As such, a top laner would be forced to have tp to deter such a change in match up due to other side of the map. While I think dragon should be a rewarding objective, the bonus damage should be later in the stack. The order of the buff should be re-examined.  Because right now, if I had a choice between taking top lane or tping/walking down to contest dragon, dragon will be favored in a landslide just for the gold value of the first buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porta Nova","date":"2014-11-20T20:06:25.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't gotten a chance to jungle yet, but dragons are seeming to be soooooo important now.
