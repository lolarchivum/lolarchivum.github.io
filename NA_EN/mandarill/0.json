How about instead of complaining about the champ, you try playing her in a ranked match above gold and see that, surprise surprise, its actually not as easy as it looks.  A shit riven will be destroyed by almost any matchup top that isn't just a complete counterpick to the enemy laner, and obviously, that can be said about literally any top lane matchup.  A decent Renekton, Darius, Garen, Camille, Nasus, Fiora, Irelia, hell, even a decent Yasuo, will beat a decent Riven.  I would be willing to say that the majority of Riven mains above gold almost play her almost exclusively, and are very dedicated to the champion.  So it probably makes a lot of sense that say, a really good Riven who has played the matchup 50+ times, will beat a pretty good Darius player who probably does not exclusively play Darius.  In reality, Riven herself isn't the one who needs the nerf, its just that the people who are williing to play her above a certain elo are extremely dedicated to the champion, and are able to practice and learn the matchups and combos extremely well.","replies":[{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2019-03-03T02:12:14.583+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well obviously you can't just pick up and play her.

Most champions like Darius, Garen, and Nasus are given way more limited kits.\n\nDedication is one thing, but a Garen or Darius main never achieves the same level of success as a Riven main because their champions have very clear limitations. Riven's innate potential to carry a game especially in higher elos is higher than that of most champions, especially the ones that you've listed outside Yasuo.
