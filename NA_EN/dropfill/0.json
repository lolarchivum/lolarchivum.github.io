This champion is horrible.\" IMO every champion should have easily-identified weaknesses. Otherwise, why wouldn't you pick the champion? It'd be a no-brainer. For example, I can take any of the top played champions from the recent World Championship and make a case for them being terrible.\n\nZilean: This is a mid-lane mage with no lategame. Only has one damage skill. And if we're in \"league of late-game AD Carries\" why would I want to pick this champion? If I revive an ADC with Chronoshift, he just dies right again anyway. IDK what the point of this champion is. I'd much rather play something like Jayce who does more damage, scales harder, gives an AoE speed boost instead of single target, and actually has self-peel, unlike Zilean.\n\nAlistar top: Wow, a \"tank\" champion whose only tank stats come from my ultimate? What if our opponents try to fight us more than every 2 minutes? This champion's useless. I have to go into melee range to CC, but then I just die right after. And I have to build damage as a top laner. How else can I threaten the back line? Such a useless champion design. I'd rather just be Maokai who has a really short ultimate cooldown, more damaging abilities, and way better healing during a fight and in lane.\n\nLee Sin: Wow, absolutely no late game. With how much champions like Thresh and Janna are being played, there's just no way I can land Q-Q-Ward-W-R without my opponent Flashing, simply dashing away (Lucian, Tristana, etc.), or the support just peeling me off. Add the fact that I have to go Lizard Elder, yet still don't actually deal that much damage, means I can't be a tank either. How is this champion supposed to team fight?\n\nAnd the list goes on. Janna has a weak laning phase and no sustain. Twitch has no escapes. Tristana has no mid-game. Lucian's ultimate is easily blocked by tanks.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that every champion has STRENGTHS, too. There were two different periods in League competitive history where Miss Fortune was a top 3 AD Carry. One was right after her release where here base stats and laning power were so strong, you just wanted to crush lane. She had all the same weaknesses: No self-peel, no in-combat mobility... And yet she had this other strength of lane dominance that made her not only worth playing, but the premiere pick. The second was in early Season Three I believe when Miss Fortune+Amumu was the comp to beat. Area of Effect team fighting. That's another strength of hers. And we saw at the World Championship people went back to champions like Rumble. We know teamfighting is still really important. But no one decided to try MF/Amumu for whatever reason, so she's \"weak.\"\n\nAlso keep in mind that every champion has synergies and anti-synergies. We live in one of two worlds:\n1. Champion select, item builds, counter-picks, etc. are entirely irrelevant.\n2. Teammate and opponent champions are important and have a direct impact on champions' success.\n\nI think it's pretty likely we live in World #2. This means that Miss Fortune's (for example) power is in fact tied to the types of teammates and enemies she goes up against. There have been multiple times in the past where her environment made her sought-after (early laning was important, people really wanted team fight power). And it's really easy to bring that back: Just choose to play for team fights, dragons, etc. And with League of Legends being a team game, it's not too hard to say, \"Hey, let's play Miss Fortune+Amumu.\" That's a world where she thrives.\n\nThe final thought I want to share in on the metagame. By definition the metagame is what everyone ELSE is playing. You don't have to pick Lee Sin, Lucian, and Kha'Zix just because everyone else is. The weird thing is, while competitive players pick their own small champion pools and play within their defined metagame, there are twice as many champions out there that are actually MORE successful in the game that WE are all playing. And other players don't have to define what we play.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-11-13T05:38:45.901+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit the character limit, wanted to follow up.\n\nEven within the current metagame (omg how could you be immobile?

Look at win rate without looking at pick rate is misleading. Ashe has a very very low pick rate. This mean she is only played by players that have superior knowledge and mechanic of the champ even for their tier and/or that she is picked only when the enemy team has absolute nothing counter her, which end up being a very rare situation. \nThe weaknesses in her kit are evident and have been pointed out in this thread. More champs that are objectively stronger than her will have a lower kit because they are picked more and because most of the player will stay at about their level and thus having a 50% win rate on average, these champs will end up having a lower win rate than the actual one of Ashe that will tend to be around 50%, and this will not tell anything on the strength of their respective kits","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-11-13T05:41:20.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Tristana's supposedly weak game.

The damage it does is far from good. The MAXIMUM amount of damage it does is , at rank 3, 1000 ( 160% ) plus 48% of your AD. If MF has like 400 of AD ( pretty rare but ok ), she will do to someone in melee range something like 1200 of physical damage.\nThis is trash, seriously.

I just play a lot of MF (and some Varus/Ashe as well), so thought I'd jump in. Here's how I think about it:\n\nLooking at some other numbers, that 1200 number seems about in line with things like Graves, Draven, Caitlyn, Lucian, and Jinx. It's just that each champ has different ways to maximize the damage output of their ult.\n\n* Lucian, for instance, can do a max of 2145 (+825% bonus AD) (+330% AP). So at the 400 AD example, that's about 5500 damage. But he only damages one target at a time.\n\n* Miss Fortune can do that 1200 damage to all 5 enemies (and in one fewer second), so her theoretical max actually goes up to 6000 damage in your example - more than Lucian's!\n\nWhat varies is the set up cost of getting full effectiveness. Lucian's is likely going to do more damage in a 1-on-1, but Miss Fortune's hits harder on a team that gets Amumu ulted*. I think that's at the core of why these champs might feel weak. There's more work involved from the team to get full value out of a Varus/MF/Ashe pick. This will probably be true for Kalista too.\n\nThe question in my mind is this: are the payoffs for that work are worth the investment? I tend to think so, and I'll play these champs when presented with a comp I think they work in. And when I don't get a comp I like for them, then I turn to a more self-sufficient ADC like Lucian or Ezreal.\n\n\\*Or ulted by Jarvan, Malphite, Zyra, Sona, Leona, Braum, Sejuani.... really, lots of ways to set up a solid MF ult!","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-11-12T02:24:39.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider opportunity cost: The damage you loose by channeling your ultimate instead of auto attacking.\nGraves or Jinx waste less than a splitt second while MFs ulti requires a full channel to deal the damage you listed (note that enemies can also run / Flash out of it more easily)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2014-11-12T03:52:45.068+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair point.

Often that's to soften as the other team engages (make sure you're far enough back!), or as they run away. My default is also to generally hold the ultimate, until a great opportunity presents itself.\n\nOne of the things I've tried to pay more attention to lately is the different ways fights unfold, and how I need to react to them. With MF, I'm really looking for the enemy team to be in one area. The most obvious is the wombo-combo lockdown, but other ones include:\n\n* All running into a fight\n* All running out of a fight\n* All fighting in one area (typically around an objective)\n\nOne option is unloading on a team that is diving/tanking one of my towers. Another option is to clean up post-fight, as they run away. And there's the ever-enjoyable, Pentakill-granting \"hey, thanks for all grouping up in Baron pit!\" ultimate.\n\nMF just really likes her enemies to be close to one another, and to move along straight lines. That way, she can line up Double-Ups and Bullet Time. Ulting from the far back line is usually pretty good, because you should have your passive to then get you into the fight and clean up.

Because Bullet Time doesn't do reduced damage to multiple targets, the best-case scenario gets pretty nuts. It's kept in check by requiring some degree of set up and/or risk.\n\nOne of the things I actually like about it being on MF is that she doesn't have that tactical, in-combat mobility, so you aren't giving that up to use the ult. When playing MF, you want to be thinking a lot about where you are and where the fight is moving, and Bullet Time actually works in that thought space.\n\nWhat she does have though is global mobility, thanks to Strut. This allows her to get to safe spaces and channel from out of a fight, then run in and clean up. I'll often run to a sidelane, get it to start slow pushing, then come back to the objective we're trying to take/defend. Ult across the fight, and Strut on in. That's map-wide pressure other ADCs can't really bring.\n\nSo, I actually haven't really felt that it's too unfair, but it does force you to think and play differently.

He feels really slow when in fact he isn't that much different from his fellow ADC's. For instance, his walking animation makes him feel like he can't chase or run away.\n\nIn terms of balance, I feel his *Passive steroid is too unreliable*. It's a little too conditional. In lane, it comes into play when you're pushing, okay. But in a team-fight? Unless you prepare an easily killed unit nearby to kill right away, you're fighting without an attack steroid besides that bit of on-hit magic damage until an enemy is already dead. \n\n{{champion:21}} : I like how she feels, and I always really want to play her, except, I will never ever play her in a game where I have a stake, because imo...\n\n*-550\n-zero mobility\n-zero self-peel*\n\n**\nI don't want all 3 of those issues fixed.** HOWEVER...I feel that an ADC shouldn't have all 3 of those issues at the same time as well.

Reduce it's radius and slow, but remove it's cast time perhaps? Or make her E apply an additional effect of preventing the use of gap-closers that aren't blink-types?\n\nIn my personal opinion after playing MF on and off again. She always feels a little too situational. And in situations she can thrive, I find that playing someone with more mobility or more range just gives me a better advantage than whatever MF could give me anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2014-11-12T02:18:53.430+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always max Q over W. Since the changes in 4.5 (I think?), maxing W only affects mana cost and the attack speed it grants. The ramping magic damage passive is actually affected by her Ult's level. Every point you put into Bullet Time gives you one more max stack of W, so you get the benefits to ult power you described regardless of W's level (as long as you have at least 1 point, of course).\n\nThat said, I have seen some guides suggest W over Q. The thinking is that increased attack speed lets you capitalize on the stacking passive better, and follow up on ults better. I haven't mathed out how it compares to Q max though, so can't say for sure.\n\nI play her more as more of a brawly/bursty character, rather than a traditional sustained DPS, so Q max also fits my playstyle better. I like to go for some CDR (early Brutalizer, sometimes even Essence Reaver), and often pick up a Trinity Force, so the auto-Q-auto pattern is pretty key. It gets down to a 3 second cooldown at max rank, before CDR!\n\nAlso, I don't think Q is much of a DPS loss, except maybe at *really* high attack speeds or crit values. Max rank Q does 80 (+85% AD), so you'd need over 500 AD for auto+Q to do less to a target than 2 autos (and you can cancel the winddown of the auto with the Q, so it's pretty much an instant double-shot). Though, like above, I haven't actually mathed this out to compare... maybe I'll do that tonight, now that it's on my mind.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2014-11-12T01:14:27.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've gotta help me out when it comes to picking Ashe.

At one point, he said something to the effect of \"if we 'nerfed' Ashe by making her ult range only 2000 units, her win rate would go up 5%.\"\n\nThat might be slight hyperbole, but the point of \"just use your ult at close range for a guaranteed stun, and go win the fight\" really stuck with me. I don't always follow this advice, but hey.\n\nBut anyways, Ashe is a pretty situational pick for me. I usually look for three things:\n\n1. Does the opposing team have kiteable enemies?\n2. Does my team have enough damage to justify me going a \"utility carry\"?\n3. Do I like the lane matchup?\n\nUsually this means I'm taking her later in the pick order. These are hard questions to answer early, and if I'm committing to an ADC blind I'll usually go for Lucian or Ezreal. Or MF, but that's due to comfort mostly. =)\n\nI picked Ashe twice recently in ranked play (for context, I ended in Gold 3 on that account). Not sure if you'll find this interesting or useful, but here were the champ selects at the time, and my thought processes going into those picks:\n\n----------------\n\n**Game 1** (Blue team; Tristana banned)\nBlue team picks:\n\n* Sona\n* Vi, Ryze\n* Akali, Ashe\n\nPurple team picks:\n\n* Irelia, Rengar\n* Lux, Caitlyn\n* (Final pick was Thresh)\n\nI thought about grabbing MF or Lucian here, but ultimately didn't (see below). To the questions above:\n\n1. Not terribly kiteable (Lux and Cait can just fight at range), but outside of Rengar's stealth engage, still straightforward enough on their part.\n2. Akali and Ryze should be pretty strong. I also liked the ability to combo w/ Vi's ult to get Akali rolling with kills.\n3. This is the biggest reason I picked Ashe. I'm not comfortable playing MF or Lucian into Caitlyn, so I usually pick Ashe (or Varus) into her to cut down on the range difference.\n\nWe lost this game. I ended with a score of 15/8/9 (24/34 kill participation), and was the clear damage threat. Unfortunately, I was counting on either Akali or Ryze (or both) to really get rolling too, which didn't happen. Also, their Lux went 19/4/13, so that was a big problem.\n\nI'm not convinced Ashe was the right call here, but they rolled hard enough it probably wouldn't have mattered who I picked. Maybe I could've done more with Lucian, and maybe Ezreal would've been smarter at the time I picked, but not sure.\n\n----------------\n\n**Game 2** (Purple team; Lucian + Tristana banned)\nBlue team picks:\n\n* Vi\n* Nidalee, Miss Fortune\n* (Final picks were Gnar, Janna)\n\nPurple team picks:\n\n* Amumu, Syndra\n* Zed, Ashe\n* (Final pick was Thresh)\n\nI was actually going to go Miss Fortune here, since we had Amumu and Lucian/Tristana were banned, but then they took her. So to those questions above:\n\n1. MF is kiteable, Nidalee kinda. Vi isn't really, since her ult is a hard engage, but it also puts her in a really obvious spot.\n2. Zed + Syndra is pretty strong damage. I knew I could ult after Vi's engages to help set them up. Between me and Amumu (and Thresh, ultimately) we could definitely get, and keep, the assassins going.\n3. I like the lane matchup too. Volley can keep MF at bay, and I can counter-ult her. Plus Ashe has a slight range advantage.\n\nWe won this one, thanks in large part to Zed (14/5/4) and Syndra (9/2/9). I had more assists than kills, which is about what I expected.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2014-11-12T05:00:51.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CertaintyT does have a point about the Ashe ult.\n\nI even tried max cd ashe (although I built Muramana which doesn't really help her due to her low mana pool) and I had my ult every 48 or so seconds.

So I don't play much blind pick, outside of team builder, but that's usually just to get comfortable on a specific champ.\n\nBlind pick is hard, because you're giving up your right to know what you're up against when you pick your champ. I think that if you play blind pick, you have to accept that sometimes you're just going to get really terrible matchups. I was trying to practice Vayne the other day, and went against a double assassin bot lane. It did NOT go well for me... but that's just blind pick sometimes. \n\nThat said, you DO know what your team is picking. So you can decide during champ select if Ashe fits (or look for a team comp where she does, if you're using Teambuilder). Similar to before, some things I'd look for:\n\n* Do we have other strong damage threats? A couple of melee carry or assassin who will benefit from permaslow?\n* Do we have other CC to follow up on an arrow? Alternately, something I can follow up with an arrow?\n* Will our team be able to peel for me? Or is this a dive heavy team that will leave me exposed in the backline?\n\nThen, during loading screen I'm asking myself similar questions about the other team. How do they get me? How can my team respond? Am I looking to force plays with my ult, or save myself with it? How are fights going to break out, and where do I want to be?\n\nPart of it is also accepting that you're always at risk of just getting blown up by Flash-Vi ult with Yasuo followup. You can't really stop that, though you can position in a way to discourage it. But ADCs are squishy and vulnerable, and that's part of the fantasy you buy into when you play one, Ashe or otherwise.\n\nSpecifics vary depending on the game. In the case you mentioned, I'm probably trying to stay back so I'm not the target of Vi's ult. Ideally a teammate engages and I follow up with an arrow. But either way, once the fight breaks out, Volley does AoE damage and slows, and should buy you time to reposition. If you didn't engage with ult, you have that too in a pinch - ideally to stop Akali/Yasuo from going off.\n\nA lot of success with Ashe specifically comes from being comfortable kiting and positioning, which takes practice. Some of this is pre-fight positioning too; making sure that you are both safe yet threatening when a fight does break out. That stuff will also just make you a better ADC player overall, in my opinion.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-11-12T01:04:09.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">The question in my mind is this: are the payoffs for that work are worth the investment?

Part of the problem might be that there are some Champs that work just like that, so more \"niche\" champs aren´t just as appealing for many people. \nIt´s a matter of Champ a working at 90% in 100% of circumstances, while champ be is at 70% 80% of the time and at 130% 20% of the time...it just doesn´t add up if you´re feeling weak 4/5 of your games just to get these awesome moments every once in a while every 5th game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-11-11T23:57:08.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't talk about MF as someone who \"mains\" her, but I can talk about her confusing kit:\n\n• \"Double Up\" deals physical damage that scales off AP\n• \"Impure Shots\" gives MF faster attacks that add a percentage of bonus AD as magic damage.\n• \"Make It Rain,\" the only straightforward item on her kit, deals magic damage that scales of AP\n• \"Bullet Time\" adds potential stacks to Impure shots (which is magic damage that scales of AD) and deals physical damage that  scales off AP.\n\nNow, how in the hell am I *supposed* to build MF with a kit like that?

Her passive also allows her to rotate between lanes/objectives faster than any other ADC.\n\nYes, a single minion stops it, but understanding how minions aggro champs is a core part to being a good playing in LoL. It's very possible to avoid getting touched if you play right. For later in the game, the new Bloodthirster's shield also gives her protection.
