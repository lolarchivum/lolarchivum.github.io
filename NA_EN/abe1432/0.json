I&#039;ve been stuck in Bronze for a while, and can&#039;t seem to get out. Yes, I&#039;ll admit, that some games are MY FAULT, but at times, my teammates can feed a lot, and cause one champion to carry the whole game. It sucks, and I know I&#039;m not the only one who is going through this.\r\n\r\nIve seen guides telling me to WARD, PING MIA, BE POSITIVE, DONT FLAME. \r\n\r\nI do exactly all of that, yet I manage to lose my games. I do fairly well, if you check out some of my games, but an example, I went 7-6 WW, with a 1-13 flaming Thresh on my team. Yes, 6 deaths is a lot, but they sure fed the laner. I am also experiencing AP ADCs, feeding the enemy ADC, which is also a factor of why I lose games. \r\n\r\nExecution is also one of them. I give ganks, and my team never seems to follow up.\r\n\r\nIs there any champion that I should play to hard carry a game? Specifically, any champions who can shut down a fed laner? Or is this how the game is going to work?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing Yi, WW, and planning on playing Nasus top, because I feel like he can hard carry.\r\n\r\nPlease any support will work. *note, I am not going to blame the reason Im in Bronze ALL on my teammates. I honestly deserve to be in Bronze atm, but a main factor of why I&#039;m not out yet is because of flaming and trolling teammates. But yes, I do suck, but games where I do good, I just cant manage to carry a team.\r\n\r\nI know that people say &quot;keep playing, eventually you&#039;ll get better&quot; that just doesnt seem to be working for me. Ill go on winning streaks, to constant losing streaks.","replies":[{"poster":"PrismalDawn","date":"2017-03-16T06:05:20.601+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Step 1: Realize it is your fault, even when it is not, it is your fault. It is always your fault.\n\nStep 2: Realize that because it is your fault everything will have to rely on you.\n\nStep 3: Because everything relies on you, pick a champion that is well rounded. I.e: Kill potential/ some sort of tankiness/ good pressure on the map/ can take objectives easily or even solo them.\n\nStep 4: Narrow your champion choices to about 3 or 4 per role. \n\nStep 5: Stay out of bot lane.\n\nStep 6: Realize that the only good roles in the game are jungle (and the solo lanes, anything but bot lane really), you seem to almost have that in grasp.\n\nNow, I see you are playing Master YI building blue smite building pure damage. Master Yi is actually pretty fucking powerful in the wrong hands. Because of his kit, he can get away with building 2 damage items (BOTRK and a Red Smite attack speed item, dont even know the name sorry lol) and going into tank. Finish your jungle item as soon as you can, run attack speed quints and reds, armor yellows, MR blues and some cooldown if you want. RED SMITE also I like ghost, lower cooldown than flash and using that and your ult no one will ever catch you or outrun you.\n\nHis ult is pretty fun to abuse, you can build mercs to lower the duration of CC and just use your ult to forget about slows. If their team has no cc and auto attacked based (Nasus top, Yasuo mid, Xin Jungle, Useless Bot lane...) you are better off building ninja tabis. Remember, the longer you can sustain a fight the better. YOU NEED TO CARRY NOT YOUR TEAM.\n\nIn this game, it is you vs the world. Your team will be bad, the enemy team will be good. \nWhen you get a kill, take that lead and run with it. Don't back, don't hesitate to take what is yours. If you kill someone in lane, push the wave out and put as much damage as you can on the tower, this will force someone to come.\n\nThere is more but that is a start.\n\nHere, look at this timeline. \n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2447706236/212780684?tab=overview\n\nI like to play braindead champions when I feel like playing a relaxing game, but this game went completely south real fast.\nMy mid and bot lane were pretty much trash and had a legendary fizz and pantheon running about. I did not care, I know what master yi can do given the time. So what I did, is I became the mid laner and jungler. I built Mercs for the shitton of cc they had, finished my two items and went solid tank. Even got a Quadra. \n\nHow did I do it?\nEvery kill I got, I got something more for it in return. I was lucky the enemy team was stupid and only fished for kills. Fizz and pantheon would roam bot, get kills and leave. Their team didn't even get a tower until minute 18, by then I already had 2. Take ANY lead you can, and run with it.\n\nIm going to play Yi right now. I'm bored.","replies":[{"poster":"Abe1432","date":"2017-03-16T06:23:22.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, you hard carried that team. I'll use this timeline as a guide for sure! How often did you gank? Because I'll admit, at times I dont gank until I reach 6.. which is something I probably should change.","replies":[{"poster":"PrismalDawn","date":"2017-03-16T07:12:00.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good question! \nHonestly, as a jungler like yi, amumu, wukong, your main priority is to get to 6.\n(Just lost the game as yi btw, feel free to look at that, some games you just have to settle are unwinnable. That lucian build, 2-11 ori mid who I have more cs than..oh well.)\n\nThough your priority is to get to 6, your main priority as a jungler is to control the map. Ganking helps, but there is no need to force one. I ONLY gank IF\n1: The enemy laner is past the halfway point of the lane.\n2: I am unseen.\nBONUS: If your teammate is someone with hard cc, CAMP THEM. Nasus is my favorite as a jungle to have on my team. All he has to do is press w and that is an instakill. \nMalphite only had to press q and we got the kill. \nWhen you gank, top, go behind the baron pit into the tri bush and behing that giant wall.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DQ3DWev.jpg\n\nNotice, when I gank mid I stay AS CLOSE AS TO THE WALL as possible. Why? Because wards can't see that far. Hump the wall. There is a chance that there might be a ward in that small bush, just clear it and either wait a second to see if they notice, or just leave if they do.\n\nAnother thing! If you are about to gank a lane and you see the enemy fall back right away, just leave. Don't wait in the bush, dont jack off in it, they know you are there just leave. Just by doing that you helped out your teammate by relieving some pressure off of them, and \"indirect gank\" if you want.\n\nWhen you do gank, you might want to activate ghost a little before they see you and WAIT until they use their abilities to get away to use yours. Yi for example, if you gank successfully WAIT until they flash or use a mobile ability to use your Q, now they are fucked. Red buff helps to slow them remember that. \n\nBefore you attempt the gank, SPAM PING ON YOUR WAY. If your teammate is smart they will engage a mini fight and will likely draw a response from the enemy. If you take my path to ganking, they will not see you until it is too late and they have cd's to wait for. \n\nSuccessful ganks include: \nBurning summoners. (FREE MONEY FOR THE NEXT 5 MINUTES)\nMaking the enemy back. (FREE MINION TAX)\nBringing forth the enemy jungle from their jungle. (FREE MOVEMENT TRACKING NOW [also possible chance to counter jungle them since they have a lane to cover now])\nBONUS: YOU GOT A KILL! (or assist) (FREE INSTANT MONEY)\n\nNotice, a kill is a bonus, it is not required. \n\nSummary: \n1. Take ghost to close the gap without using your abilities to close a gap.\n2. Wait until they use their abilities (or summoners) to use yours and fuck em.\n3. Taking a longer route to gank bring out a better success rate.\n4. Camp those immobiles with no flash. \n5. Camp those with heavy cc, EVEN BETTER IF IT IS POINT AND CLICK. (Pantheon, Nasus, Malphite, Leona, Lulu, Ryze...ect..)\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.\n\nEdit: Camp those you have heavy cc ON YOUR TEAM.\nEdit 2: Bot lane is the hardest to gank btw (wards everywhere!) But if you spam ping your team and activate ghost, you can always meet them at a safe point in the lane to get kills. I honestly don't like to waste time in bot lane unless my team has some heavy engage because it triggers a tunnel vision in everyone for a good 5 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-03-17T04:29:55.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once hard carried a game as yi where I had 34 kills; 84% kill participation.

Do not \"stay out of bot\". Always look for opportunities to gank. If bot lane is being shoved and there's a pink in the closest bush, then try and gank.

What is your main role? Jungle? Top?\n\nI am a top lane main, and what helped me climb all the way to Gold V was simply learning how to snowball a lead once you got it. Specific Topics:\n\nWave Management- Learn this skill, it is incredibly helpful. If you lane, it will help you to deny your opponent cs as well as boost your lead in XP and gold and also to set  up ganks. Outside of lane, it helps you to keep pressure in lanes when you are not there so you can be with your team.\n\nDeep Warding- In the early game especially, if you get an EZ opportunity, get a deeper ward where you can spot enemy jungler movements. Helps to know what objectives to fight for, where you can gank/counter gank.\n\nEducate yourself- Watch youtube videos on your favorite champions, start with only like 1-3. No more than that at first. Learn their strengths, their weaknesses, power spikes, etc.\n\nLast but not least: BE AGGRESSIVE AS ELO HELL: Seriously, you can't get lower than bronze, so take this opportunity to push your limits hard. Learn what you are capable of, Try for that 1v4 dragon/baron steal with smite. If you have a lead, fight the 1v2. You have to test your limits so that when you get out of bronze you at least have some kind of understanding of them.\n\nBonus: Be decisive. Make a decision and go for it. Don't look back. Know what you are going to buy in the shop before you get there. Wasting time is the #1 issue in bronze play (from my experience).\n\nGood luck out there on the RIFT!","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-03-16T06:17:17.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super BONUS:\n\nMy suggested champs for each role- (can carry hard/snowball, and are not that difficult to learn)\n\nTOP: {{champion:122}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:80}} \n\nJUNGLE: {{champion:102}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:104}} \n\nMID: {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:99}} \n\nBOT: {{champion:22}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:21}} \n\nSUP: {{champion:12}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:25}}","replies":[{"poster":"Abe1432","date":"2017-03-16T06:19:52.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could Nasus be a suggested champ for top lane as well?

This works best when you main one, maybe two champs. Every champion has different limits on what they can do and when.

What I did is found one champ I liked and played the living crap out of it.  For me that was Katarina.  She snowballed well and I'd kill mid a few times and then roam bot and get them ahead.  League is all about teamwork.  Find a champion who you can play well and main them. I like champions that can push down towers and snowball like crazy.  At the moment, Yasuo is my main.  I'm climbing slowly, but I try not to let the games where I make mistakes or my team feeds get me down.  IN PARTICULAR if you start losing, e.g. you lose two games in a row.... take a break! Go eat some ice cream, then come back.  You'll do better and your loss streaks will become smaller.  If you want to get really good, think about every time you die in a match and figure out why it happened.  By doing that you can learn how not to die and from then on you're a little bit better.  Goodluck! Feel free to add me if you ever want a duo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kidsruinlol","date":"2017-03-16T06:39:24.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze is all about the 1v9.
