If occasional threads that have 3 and below upvotes and are usually downvoted and never make it to the front page to get any relevancy ruined it for you then that's just ridiculous.

Don't know where this ilusion was conjured, but everytime I see someone saying \"When URF isn't there, people want it, when it's there, people complain about it\" I question whether these people passed elementary school mathemathics. In past year or two, no, there certainly wasn't big tide of people bitching about URF. Now and then someone wants URF back (like this ONE thread appearing after MONTHS or WEEKS of silence about it), when URF is around, I cannot see single relevant thread about how it's bad and unbalanced.

Certain exceptions existed last weekend like Rengar and Kha, but I blame their recent updates rather than the gamemode. About the only champs that just aren't viable in Ascension are most marksmen, since they're given no time to CS before being rushed into a hectic teamfight and no one signed up to be a support and peel for them.\n\nMeanwhile, the discrepancy between top tier picks and average picks in URF is so high it makes Snoop Dog jealous. You get a team of average URF champs together against a team that picks Eve, and you're fucked. The only way to fight broken URF champs is to have one yourself. That's why ARURF didn't fix much, teams were getting janky champs while their opponents were pulling out Ezreal and Wukong. The chances for success are heavily stacked right from champ select.\n\nThe biggest problem is that URF is so rarely used that Riot doesn't have to balance it. They don't give a damn that top tier picks are so gamebreaking because the mode is only around for a handful of days the entire year. If URF came more frequently, Riot would have to try to balance that shit. What are they going to do, pre-ban all the broken champs? That's a good chunk of the roster gone. Try to balance champs just for URF? The balance team is struggling with SR as it is now. Buff the weaker champs? What are you going to do, give them more CDR? Let them start three levels ahead? Change the minimap to pictures of their favorite champs in bathing suits so that players have something to look at during the constant grey screens?\n\nAfter a handful of games, URF stops being fun because you have the same champs kicking your ass all the time. Ascension doesn't have that problem; most of the time, anyway. That's why modes like Ascension and Hexakill come around so often, players can actually play a lot of their favorite champs in them without getting stomped into the ground. Meanwhile, if you're not exclusively picking top tier champs in URF, you're not going to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-11-20T16:08:30.362+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">Change the minimap to pictures of their favorite champs in bathing suits so that players have something to look at during the constant grey screens?\n\n{{champion:111}} \"What?

RGM was supposed to fix this, allow modes to be more frequent and yet maintain its uniqueness. They achieved that by limiting them to merely four days. This all was designed directly for URF so that it can come out more times per year. Yet it turned into Ascension all the year, sometimes One for All and Hexakill, rarely Nexus Siege and LotPK.\n\nDon't understand what was the point of cutting URF into four days when it came only like... twice? Thrice? Basically URF this year was there for nearly the same amount or slightly more than last years, just separated. Yet this system was supposed to bring it back more frequently and only limit it to four days so that it doesn't get boring for several weeks. Instead once people'll miss it again, it'll return in small doses.\n\nSo this argument of yours was fine last years, not this year, with Random weekly modes that came from the idea on Boards to bring URF more frequently just for fewer days.

Players respond well to these types of modes, since it removes a lot of the more frustrating or slow features of League like CSing and role calling. (I personally suspect the popularity of modes like Poro King and Ascension stems in no small part from no one being forced to be support)\n\nBMB was more of a mode to test new item ideas than anything else. The ability to buff and upgrade your own minions was neat _on paper_, but quickly became lame as it meant comebacks were difficult and snowballing was all important.
