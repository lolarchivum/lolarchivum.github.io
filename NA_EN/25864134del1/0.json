I&#039;ll be the first one to admit that I am a toxic player who is easily capable of starting to insult people (calling them trash, mostly) when they make serious gameplay mistakes or personally attack me. Fine, I deserve a punishment. But does it have to be a 2 week ban and a perma ban sometime later? I know my temper won&#039;t change. Eventually someone will once again trigger me to the point where I get multiple reports and an autoban. But I never troll in any other way. I always (99% of time, at least) play to the best of my ability, never intentionally feed or ruin game in other way. So wouldn&#039;t a permanent chat ban/restriction will be a more fitting punishment for me? I would eagerly mute myself if there were such an option, most people communicate with pings nowadays anyway, words are no longer essential for efficient gameplay. I understand that I deserve a punishment, but I do strongly feel that this is the wrong one... You don&#039;t give a life sentence to a person who screams profanities on a street, after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-04-26T18:20:18.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as it's been 11 months since this thread was created, I am locking it.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n or [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-05-22T18:26:48.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"14-day ban out of nowhere sounds like you were using slurs, which Riot explicitly has a zero-tolerance policy regarding.

In the future just know that you have to actually play games in order for the system to determine whether your behavior has changed or not, and this is intended so that griefers and would-be griefers can't just simply stop playing for an extended period of time and hope/expect that the system forgets about their behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"25864134DEL1","date":"2017-05-22T21:53:33.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the info, didn't know that.
