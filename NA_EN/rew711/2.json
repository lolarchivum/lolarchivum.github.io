What does reducing its cooldown enable that you couldn't already do and that you should be able to or need to do?\n\nThe cooldown is just a big part of the ultimate feeling so unsatisfying as a whole. While a character like Eve should never have a gamechanging ultimate, when you have what is already a mediocre ultimate on an early game cooldown reserved for the truly insane ults like Paranoia, it makes the character feel so unfairly treated.\n\nI absolutely understand the necessity for Evelynn to have a long cooldown on her early game ultimates because her ganks are so difficult to prevent and her passive as a whole provides a LOT of early game power, but Agony's Embrace honestly is weak to the point that it's a relatively poor power spike for her ganks when it IS up. A very moderate nuke that falls off hard if the gank victims are at all far away from full health with a mediocre slow and a shield that in a ganking scenario is essentially useless is just... honestly not threatening. And when you add in how little she can use it, it's just so bizarre. Quite frankly her ganks pre-6 are more threatening than her post-6 ganks, but there's no barrier to her chain ganking at that point of the game, yet when people hit 6 (and generally get better at peeling off ganks), Evelynn has a random gate (the giant ult cooldown) that means she can only keep up with the power of the laners once every three minutes. That feels very off and doesn't really address her power curve in the right way IMO.\n\nIt's one of the big parts of her kit that makes me think she needs a rework. I've never heard of a single person who thought it was a powerful or fun ultimate to use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-08-12T22:58:28.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about others, but I rarely use her ultimate for the slow.

It has no value as an explanation given that you could destroy her entire kit and give the same speech practically verbatim for that as well.\n\n>Do you guys generally think it should be on a shorter cooldown? Does it feel too long to succeed as Eve? What does reducing its cooldown enable that you couldn't already do and that you should be able to or need to do?\n\n1- Yes. Look at Lee's kit and ultra short cooldowns it has in addition to Lee being manaless. And before you say \"BUT EVELYNN IS INVISIBLE!\" she is not invisible, she can only bypass green wards, not stalk people like Twitch and Shaco... Lee can also easily bypass green wards through his multiple low cooldown manaless dashes. Also look at the raw power that Lee's ultimate has, as an AoE stun, single target stun and single target snare with huge AD scaling along with shorter cooldown than Evelynn's ultimate. Where the balancing point here? either Evelynn needs buffs or Lee Sin needs nerfs.\n\n2- No, I can succeed with Evelynn even with an ultra high cooldown on the ultimate, but only through great effort which is not as required with other champions.\n\n3- The ability to assassinate or otherwise engage in a team fight without being massively crippled if another engage occurs swiftly after that one. Basically it is a matter of decision making where either decision is bad because of the long cooldown. Again, it has one of the longest cooldowns for the level of power it has. \n\nThe cooldown for Evelynn's ult has been nerfed before and it was just as , unjustified during those instances. I understand that the post I'm responding to is 5 months old but the point is just as valid.\n\nEvelynn takes nerfs over and over with the argument always being \"BUT SHES INVIS!!!\", how about you take that same level of \"SMASH FIRST, NEVER ASK QUESTIONS\" to Lee  , Zed, Yasuo , Thresh or Riven?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shmannigan","date":"2016-01-05T05:17:14.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OKAY. So. I've been playing A TON of Eve this past week. She's probably my new favorite champ. Rumble's Rumble, but.. Idk. Anyway. I've been thinking about this a lot, and loving Eve as much as I do i think that the CD on her ult is reasonable to an extent. With attack/move speed in her kit and the ability to proc sheen/rylai's endlessly with her low Q cooldown I think that it makes sense to have her ult on a high cooldown. I'm not a great jungler so I lane with her top/mid mostly. But I can figure out that a skilled jungler with this ult on a low cooldown would be a monster. Like stupid monster. Like Eve perma banned monster. So personally, I think Eve is already competitively viable, there are just better options for junglers, who would be the ones using her in pro games. But if you guys over at Rito would like to see her played on the LCS level I would say a SLIGHTLY lower ultimate cooldown would be best. I'll leave it to you guys to decide how much lower that would be.

Evelynn doesn&#039;t have much, and that&#039;s her only real burst, can we lower it to about 70 or at most 65 by max level?\n\nno, lets just remove that garbarge ultimate altogether and replace it with something that can actually kill targets.","replies":[{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2015-08-12T08:20:59.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hallows Evelynn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=InIZL5Op,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-08-12T03:06:28.585+0000)replace it with something that can actually kill targets.\n\nWell luckily, it just so happens she has 2 other abilities that are able do just that! :D Not to mention a Sonic mode on her w. :DDD\n\n\nBut seriously replace her ultimate with something relevant to her popular play style. Current one is pretty much trash.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2015-08-12T04:27:32.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So her ult CD is 150/120/90\n\n150 is a bit much for an ult like that but it dramatically drops as you get into the game, much more than other ults.  Considering it temporarily makes her a tank and sets up fights on its own and she can roam around the map at her leisure as long as she doesn't get caught, it seems like a fair power curve.  Though personally if she needed any buff at most I'd make it 120/105/90 instead just so its more in line with other ults early, though just her gank pressure alone pulls from the power budget there.  Its a tough call balance wise, I don't blame Riot for not messing with her much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-08-12T03:51:06.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I mean, it is relatively powerful when it's used properly. The more champs it hits, the bigger the shield she gets is; it works really well when she's already somewhat fed and she is easily strong enough to kill two-three targets, she just needs that slight amount of sustain for it.
