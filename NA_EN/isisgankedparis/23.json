If you flash mid-pull animation then you will be brought back because while Flash is instant and that's cool and all, that means it does not override the targetting mechanism of Darius' cast timed pull because Flash already got you where you needed to go. After that, Darius is still casting, and so at the very end of the cast, you go to the location marked for you since you didn't have an overlapping cast time that would continue after Darius' to get you out of there, like, say, Ezreal can.
