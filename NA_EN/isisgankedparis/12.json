The real difference is that no matter how much armor or magic resist is accumulated, those won't reduce the damage... and yet many other defensive effects claim True Damage as an exception. True Damage hardly needs this buff. It should be reducible by debuffing the enemy champion, as often they have the option of buffing it.\n\nIn other words:\n\nArmor / MR is countered by Armor Pen / Magic Pen\nPhysical / Magical damage is countered by Armor / MR\nTrue Damage buffing (Ahri/Olaf/Cho scaling) is countered by debuffing damage\n\nIt hardly needs spelled out, as the gimmick should never have been introduced in the first place, but True Damage needs no such buff, especially in a game where HP is getting harder and harder to come by.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-03-16T15:10:43.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Scaling =/= increasing damage.\n\nScaling = FUCKING SCALING.\n\nIncreasing or decreasing damage, by this definition, is anything that alters the printed damage of the ability.

What? It scales, and the damage increases. 100 damage becomes 120. Tell Irelia about how scaling makes no difference. She couldn't if she tried. And, this is much more than you can say for armor/MR on the other side. Printed damage is still damage, and more damage than without the scaling. Damage with absolutely no method of mitigation, other than of course very few damage decreasing abilities. Few champs get True Damage, and few champs get to decrease it. And towers.\n\nWith HP being hard to stack much in the game anymore, it's even more abusive. Whether or not True Damage is consistent, it does not need such a buff anyway. Champs like Vayne would have basically no threat from lategame destruction, and Cho can combo chomp anything with ease, which wouldn't be hard to survive on Cho, anyways, as his ultimate is one of the few remaining HP bastions. Even Olaf can wear down an enemy while taking damage, and sneak in a quick execution strike with full power, unlike the rest of his kit, or anyone's kit that doesn't contain true damage. Towers are meant to be a pain to everyone equally, and leaving True Damage out of it would only reinforce the joke that tower defense is.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-03-18T17:28:33.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No: Nobody gets to decrease it.

It was not a balance change.\n\nAnd again, Increasing/Decreasing damage is unrelated to scaling. For example, lets say we've got an ability that says \"You deal 20% bonus damage to the target.\" Your physical damage would be increased by 20%. Your magic damage would be increased by 20%. Your true damage WOULD NOT be increased by 20%. Because True damage always deals the printed damage. If you have an ability that deals 10 true damage, it deals 10 true damage. If you have an ability that deals true damage based on 10% of your AP, you will deal true damage equal to 10% of your AP. If your AP increases, that isn't a \"Damage increase\" by the rules of the game. Yes, the damage is increased, but learn to separate game terms and common vernacular. Tanks don't have 200mm cannons in League either.
