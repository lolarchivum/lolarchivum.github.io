Abyssal was basically a cheaper deathcap that not only gave you 60 ap, but also increased all your magic damage by 10%, giving you more power than it's stats would indicate.

Additionally why you rush it is because when mid lane roams, you get more use out of the aura, plus you won't have deathcap ready by the time team fights start, but you definitely will have abyssal ready, which gives you and your team more damage by buying just one cheap item.\n\nYou are right though, people on the boards are stupid and you are proving it by trying to argue this point.
