However, 6 bans aren&#039;t enough. I end up done with banning phase unsatisfied because I know there will still be someone who is really strong that is super annoying to play against. Why didn&#039;t you give 1 ban to each player? 10 bans in total. I mean, in the old champion select, it looked like there was room for two more champion icons to be in the banned area. Almost like you intended to add more bans.\n\nEdit: I hadn't thought of this until you guys brought it up. Yes, this would make it so you would need to have 20 champions to play draft. This is because there is the super super super rare possiblity that of the 10 bans, they're all champions that you own or are on free week, then all the rest of the champions picked are the only ones that you have and you're last pick. If you have any less than 20 champions and this occurs, you're screwed. Also, this game has 120+ champions. 6 bans aren't enough.\n\nEdit: To those who are saying that 6 bans are plenty, here are what the bans for my games normally look like.\nMy Team:               |  Enemy Team:\nDr. Mundo              |  Garen      \nDarius                     |   Gangplank\nBlitzcrank                |   Poppy\n\nThere are still more champions that are super strong right at the moment and can easily carry games. I'd love to be able to have 2 more bans for my team so we could ban things like Nidalee and Tahm Kench. Then the other team has 2 more bans as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharyn","date":"2016-01-21T21:05:23.765+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"the point of banning isn't to get rid of every one that I could potentially be annoying to play against or to get rid of all of the Fotm champs. \nEven if riot gave us 10 champs to ban, it wouldn't fix much.
