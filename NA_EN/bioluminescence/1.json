And it's even worse when you come back to lane and get immediately tower dove 2v1.. but it's those ass-hats that think they know what's going on and call you a feeder that brings in the tilt.\n\nLet me paint a little picture for you. Mid lane, Varus vs. Zed. You almost 1v1 zed, get him down to 32 health and ping for the jungler since zed isn't recalling. 3-5 minutes later when Zed has recovered almost to full the jungler comes and stops you from recalling with a barrage of pings... so you go out and bait, and you start fighting, and the jungler is still sitting in the brush, 15 seconds of fighting later you're dead and your jungler still has not moved from the brush. Afterwards, the jungler comes out and proceeds to taunt the Zed who just killed me. Zed levels up and immediately ults rengar for an easy kill...\n\nNow that in and of itself is pretty bad, because I now have a 2-0 zed to go up against, and I was winning the lane prior to the 'gank'. I kind of felt like I got baited by my own jungler, which was the case whether he meant it to be or not. Anyway, we all come back to lane and I'm poking like Varus does... so I run out of mana. I happen to see rengar heading for blue so I ping and walk over... and this is at around 8 minutes now, he smites it to make sure he takes the buff.\n\nSo here's the tilting part for me. I'm like, \"so you're not only going to feed my enemy laner, but you won't let me have blue buff?\" he says, \"nope\". And then brand support from the bot lane tells me I'm in a losing matchup so I should not get blue all game... lol. I ended up telling everyone open mid and hanging out at the fountain for a good 5 minutes, I was downright irate. Possibly even more so at brand for being the jackass who talks like he knows something than the jungler. My team started just raging and ragging on me even more and more... talking about me in all chat.\n\nTelling me i'm a little baby and talking badly about me in /all chat, and then when I mention I'm actually a 31 year old man they jump on that and start ragging on me for being 31 I guess. Telling me I live in my parents basement, yadda yadda, blah blah... It's not at all the bad games that get to me... it's people like that.\n\nHonestly though, with my team trying to set up my lane for failure (through berating me and denying me blue buff, and feeding my laner) I felt like I should not have to try and help those assholes win the game. The kicker is them trying to buddy up to the enemy team and get them to report me when the game was over. I actually got a notice about being reported when the game finished...\n\nAlso almost forgot Rengar told Zed in all chat he wouldn't be anywhere near mid the rest of the game so he could just go ham on me.... and all they do is laugh when I say I'm reporting them. Where's the justice in this situation? My reports on them probably went unnoticed, but because they managed to have 3 people report me I get a notice about it and they probably got nothing. I've put a ton of money into this game... and I feel like jack squat is being done about little ass-hats like the ones I've mentioned here.\n\nNevermind the remedy for getting off tilt, you can stop it at the source. I don't feel like my reports are taken seriously... and obviously neither do these people who act like the worlds biggest asses and laugh in your face when you say you're reporting them. Just because some little ass-hat got his duo que friend to report me doesn't mean I did anything wrong, and just because I'm the only one reporting the guy who was a giant ass to me doesn't mean he doesn't deserve punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2016-01-12T13:39:58.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I'm not sure I've seen a more true post in the last year than this one.  I've reported people who wished death on myself, my family, and in rather graphic ways and saw their accounts playing days later.  I reported a few individuals who used various types of hate speech, and yet there they were still playing days later.  \n\nI think you might be the only one who gets it, de-tilting isn't the solution but removing the source of the tilt is.  I mean, I got reported once because I told a jungler that they didn't have a clue what they were doing and they went 0/15.  Yet, I got reported for abuse?  It was abuse having to play that game.  Oh, and don't dare tell those people who wish you die of (trendy disease name here) anything or else you get reported for that and they seem to get off scot free.\n\nWhen I talk to a lot of people they all tell me they think League is the most toxic community of any PVP game they play, and some of them said they were on here and then left when they encountered all the ridiculous comments.  I normally do not play games like this, I got asked to join with some friends and did so and turned out rather well overall, but I think its time for some big changes.  Changes like ensuring people who duo queue as a fake bronze/silver when they are actually plat or diamond to level up their friends lose ALL their ranked rewards on both accounts, same for their buddy, effectively punishing ranked smurfs.  Changing matchmaking so you don't have to fight people 2-3 tiers higher than you, which isn't supposed to happen anyway.  I also have serious questions about why people I put on the block list can queue in and play on the same team as me after being reported and blocked... seriously, like I want to play with them again?  \n\nI think the main source of a lot of salt is that no matter how well you do, if one or two people on the team screw up you lose.  Why not have a ranked 1vs1 or 2vs2 mode?  Pull out some of the selfish players and make them actually back up their tough talk and put a rank on it!  Unfortunately, I have no faith any of this would happen.  It would be fun, though, to get the super selfish players out of the team mode and into a \"1vs1 me bro!\" mode.","replies":[{"poster":"CheapBoxOWine","date":"2016-01-12T15:19:49.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's scary to me that you stalk the people you hate...","replies":[{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2016-01-13T14:43:49.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't.

If I'm playing a champion that I'm trying to learn, I switch back to my main in that role. If I'm playing one of my mains, I always find my way back to Morgana support. She is the one champion that I know I can win any matchup. I also can do the same thing on Cho'gath top. If you're a requeue player when you're on tilt, I highly suggest having pillars you can always fall back to and know you'll play well.","replies":[]}]}
