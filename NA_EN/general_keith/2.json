That might work if this were a literal subtitle, or perhaps spoken narration for visually impaired viewers (\"a Void Burrower attacks\"), but it's a very literal way to refer to the Champion, and strikes me as strange-sounding.\n\nI'm reminded of Orianna being changed from \"The Clockwork Girl\" to \"The Lady of Clockwork\" due to some alleged IP concern. (I think?) I thought that was a weak change. (As one friend observed to me, even \"The Lady Clockwork\" would have a better sound to it.)\n\nI recall reading that there are two main schools of thought in Riot about Champion titles: some think they should be sort of poetic and abstract, while others thing they should be very literal. The example given was Skarner, as \"the Crystal Vanguard\"; one Rioter said that if it had been up to them, he'd be called \"the Crystal Scorpion\".\n\nPersonally, I prefer the more descriptive titles, as I think you do as well. For instance, I think it's cooler to have Garen known as \"the Might of Demacia\" than \"the Demacian Warrior\" or \"the Armored Knight\" or something.","replies":[{"poster":"General Keith","date":"2014-12-12T19:38:13.216+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CupcakeTrap,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=R0QAbvqb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-12T19:25:17.223+0000)\n> \"subtitle\"\n> \n> https://backtothethames.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/inigomontoya.jpg\n\nWhoah whoah whoah whoah.

Still, for what it's worth, I think \"title\" sounds more natural than \"subtitle\", given the frequent use of the latter to refer to movie subtitles.\n\nFor example, consider \"King George, Defender of the Faith\". You could say that \"King\" or \"King George\" is his title, and call \"Defender of the Faith\" his subtitle, but I believe it's much more common to call \"Defender of the Faith\" a title.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackMagicWilson","date":"2014-12-14T07:53:57.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be much more accurate if you said 'epithet' instead of \"subtitle\".
