I'll include everything that's been tried so far and we can bounce ideas around.\n\nRed Post from the past stated:** Porocles (NA) ** - 3 days ago\nThis is an issue impacting quite a few players right now, and updates are being provided on the service status page. In the meantime, this workaround should resolve the issue:\n\nGo to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" with notepad\nFind the line:\n\ngameflow-patcher-lock:\n\nDelete this whole line\nSave the file, restart your LoL Client - and you should be able to log in again.\n\nIf you received a leaverbuster as a result, hit us p in a support ticket. I can't make guarantees about having it removed, but we prefer review each case individually!\n\nThis is not working and we still have yet to receive a new red post regarding the issue.\n\nUpdate: Did a full repair and it failed. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681668 is where it sent me. Everything there checked out fine. I had just restarted before I initiated repair.\nUpdate 2: Cleared everything in the LeagueClientSettings and even deleted the file entirely and still same issue.\nMy LeagueClientSettings now read like this:\n\ninstall:\n    gameflow-patcher-lock: null\n    globals:\n        locale: \"en_US\"\n        region: \"NA\"\n    last-valid-login-splash:\n        theme: \"vs\"\n        version: \"1.17\"\n    licensesAgreedTo:\n        BAB01EBF2B9BD188EB8076017D6808B5: null\n    opt-in-has-migrated-v2: true\n    opt-in-migration-attempts-remaining-v3: 2\n    rso-auth:\n        install-identifier: \"9ee74c2d8057484581de93b644aacdef\"\n    telemetry:\n        installation_id: \"vpeGVw==\"\n\nUpdate 3: Reinstalling has been shown to not be a fix. You will be unable to automatically patch. Manual patching still being looked into. -Thanks to Dr Death\n\nUpdate 4: Tried pasting in a friend's code from LeagueClientSettings, as he was able to log in, and tried again. The file still reverts back to the stunted form on client relaunch. Restarting and Shutting Down and rebooting computer still no changes. Will try full repair once more while brainstorming continues.\n\nUpdate 5: Making changes to LeagueClientSettings and turning it into read only as well as keeping the file open during relaunch still prove to not work. Also changing null to true in the code does not fix either. -Thanks Noooob\n\nUpdate 6: Hextech Repair tool ran with following options: \nRun Ping Test\nSync System Clock\nGather System and LoL Logs\nAutomatically Assign (DNS)\nAdd Firewall Exceptions (Enables firewall)\nDisable Firewall\n \nNot Successful in fixing issue. Trying With:\nForce repatch\n\nNot Successful in fixing issue.\n\nUpdate 7: \nUsed Hextech repair tool to Reinstall and once that was not successful I tried Clean Uninstall also selected. This was also not successful in resolving the issue. \n\nAlso have the reinstall issue where the LoL website only offers the legacy client download instead of the new alpha download.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 HlGH","date":"2017-06-18T11:11:50.166+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I HAVE SOLVED THIS ISSUE.

The recommended fix. I noticed that the \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" file was being reverted after restarting the client.\n\n2. Closing all instances of League (Task Manager), saving the \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" file while there are no instances of League (or any child background processes), and then reopening the client. The file reverted again.\n\n3. Shutting down my computer, waiting for 30 seconds, powering it back on, and then modifying the \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" before accessing anything else. The file reverted again.\n\n4. Changing the \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" filename to \"LeagueClientSettings2.yaml\" and restarting the client. The \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" was recreated with the \"gameflow-patcher-lock: null\" line.\n\n5. Changing the \"gameflow-patcher-lock: null\" line to various other inputs such as \"false\", \"true\", and a series of numbers, and setting the file to Read Only.\n\n6. Idling in the client. Some users reported that their issue was resolved after idling in the client for 5-15 minutes. I idled in the client for approximately 2 hours, with no changes.\n\n7. Changing the Server my client was pointed at. This was a suggested fix in the parent \"KNOWN ISSUE\" board. I noticed an odd issue- I was getting stuck when pointed at the OCE server. My client said it needed to patch, but would get stuck in a permanent loop of trying to connect to the patching server when doing so (trying to reopen the client forced me to restart into the patcher after 10 seconds). I had to manually re-enter North America as my server in the \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" to get out of the loop. The settings successfully reverted back to NA, but I was still locked out of the account.\n\n8. Initiating a Full Repair. The full repair failed, so I checked my hard drive to ensure there was enough space and retried it a second time. It failed again (likely because of the server connectivity issue).\n\n9. Uninstalling and reinstalling. The local files were removed quickly and the installer worked fast, but whenever I attempt to open the League Client (old icon), the application (PVP.net Patcher Kernel) starts to idle. Allowing the system to continue the process results in an \"HTTP Error: Failed to connect to RADS server\".\n\n10. Fixing the connection to the RADS server using old methods. First I changed to public DNS servers, and then I tried to access a fresh copy of the RADS Kernel executable file. I am unable to connect to l3cdn.riotgames.com to download any files (though I have not attempted it in so long that I am not sure it is still a working domain).\n\n11. Manual patching. As far as I know, all manual patching was and still is done through the l3cdn.riotgames.com domain. I cannot access that domain or download any files off of it.\n\nI think this is genuinely a patching server connectivity issue. People who are getting locked out of league have not received the fix that Riot pushed out at 10:40 AM on 17 June 2017, and are unable to access the server to fix it. I have no idea what's causing it and since it is server side, there is likely no fix that can be provided besides what already has.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Death","date":"2017-06-18T07:54:59.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick note- I don't think it is a problem that the legacy client is downloaded from the Riot website- the problem is that the patcher that usually initiates from the Legacy Client shortcut (as it has since they disabled the legacy client) is unable to connect to a server to get the new client and up-to-date patches.\n\nI submitted a trouble ticket with basically this post verbatim, as well as all of the logs created by the Hextech Repair Tool.
