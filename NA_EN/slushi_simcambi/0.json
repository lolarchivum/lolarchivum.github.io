I want you to imagine {{champion:122}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:420}}  champs like that with damage reduction vs champs + a damage amp that works on turrets.

These are now super important objectives, and not just \"w.e\" objectives. \n\nIf you're not ganking at level 2/3 you're doing it wrong.  Kindred won't be ganking all that quick because her new Q change is slow as fucking dick, and the faster junglers will already be getting first bloodin mid/bot/top before you're even done with your blue buff and then getting them snowballed for dragon/baby baron within the next minute or two.\n\nTop with baby baron requires absolute pressure up there, otherwise they'll win 1v1 trades incredibly hard which makes it so you can't pressure bot or mid which will then indirectly be snowballed out of control because the enemy jungler will rotate and snowball them as well.\n\nAll these little things matter because it's what determines the mid game. Kindred is also intentionally designed as a feast or famine champion based on how well she performed before mid game. They simply removed her mid game, and also deleted her late game at the same time.\n\n\nI know you really don't ever have to deal with these types of thoughts, but in my mmr I do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-05-03T06:50:54.530+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=casedeath,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nEsPOO6P,comment-id=000300000002000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-03T06:45:00.138+0000)\n\n> I know you really don&#x27;t ever have to deal with these types of thoughts, but in my mmr I do.\n\nClassy.\n\nI'd like to point out that Kindred MIGHT be getting nerfed for a reason.

IF she didn't have slightly higher base armor the amount of damage she'd take would make it impossible to do her job well. \n\nTryndamere has higher base health than usual because he's at his prime fighting at lower levels of health, but also takes time to wind up. If he had low base health his kd would go from 1/8 avg to 1/16 and accomplish jack.\n\nHe's already heavily reliant on level 2 cheese  and barely survives that as is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2016-05-03T06:31:58.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same reason Sion has higher base AD at all points in the game: Sion builds armor but doesn't build much AD.
