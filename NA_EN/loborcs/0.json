With this said, let&#039;s go. \n\nSo you&#039;ll probably know it by now (at least if you are a lore fanatic as crazy for the map as me) but Riot is sending wooden pieces of the map to some of the loremaster youtubers out there:\n\nFor now we have 2 pieces: \n\n* One for Necrit: https://twitter.com/Necrit94/status/1020283431639568384\n \n* One for Nero Wolf: https://www.facebook.com/NeroWolf66/posts/1845212495518111\n\nNecrit&#039;s one seems to be Ionia but I don&#039;t think we can talk too much about that for now because we don&#039;t have a lot of references... but what about the other one? \n\nNeroWolf&#039;s one is veeeery interesting \n\n**WARNING 2:** First time I post images so I&#039;m not sure if i&#039;m doing it well. \n\nWhy? Because [**we already knew some things**](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/piltover/medarda-heirloom) about parts of this map. \n\nLook at this. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/uhhnPO1.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/O3qN4VR.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aKUB3Pi.jpg\n\nSeems clear now? \n\nIf not look at this \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HXDipEb.jpg\n\nSo now we know how does** the eastern side of the Southern Continent** looks like.\n\n_Can I go a bit further? Maybe? _\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n**Everything from here is just pure speculation** that may have sense in the future or may not have it at all \n\nSo... Let&#039;s do this. \n\nFrom the icon map + the Medarda&#039;s map we can see this: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/A2i0Yng.jpg\n\nNow we know that all the coast seems to be a bit less than the total width of the Southern Continent (from East to West) \n\nMedarda&#039;s ships take (according to the map)** around 18 - 20 days to cross from Kalamanda in the West to Mudtown in the East. **\nBut... how fast a merchant ship of Pilltover can be? We don&#039;t know. \nBut we know how fast were the ships of [the Portugal and Spanish trade empires in the XV - XVI centuries ](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~vaucher/History/Ships_Discovery/)\n\nThe average was 4 knots for 90-100 miles in a day. Maybe we can take even 5 knots and 120 miles. So what happens if you take that 120 miles a day and you translate that into kilometers?\n\nYou have between 3500 and 4000 kilometers and that &#039;s close to the Mediterranean Sea width. So we can say it: Southern Continent at least in it&#039;s north side is almost the same size as Northern Africa.\n\nSo Shurima Empire in it&#039;s apogee was big. I do not want to speculate a lot here without knowing more about the real dimensons of the Southern continent but Shuriman Empire may have been [around the maximum size of the Roman Empire ](https://visualunit.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/roman_empire.png)\n\nWhat do you think about this? Seems promising for me. \n\nThanks @Riot! But we want more. We want everything!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-07-20T22:43:15.214+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"I _like_ you.

I decided about my example according to 2 factors:\n\nThere's also the factor that the map is an heirloom, and, while some things have been crossed out, the time-to-travel has *not*. This indicates that it is likely a family heirloom passed from generation to generation, and so likely matches older ship technology rather than newer -- technology still in use, or the times would have been updated. Additionally, we have never seen any sort of tech-enhanced ship in any of the Bilgewater art, and Bilgewater is a place one would expect to see such a thing if it were at all common, as it would make an amazing prize.\n\nMy suspicion is that -- while such a ship likely does exist -- they are highly expensive, few, and extremely far between. The sort of thing a Zaunite chem-baron might have one of, for example, rather than the sort of thing a trade family would own. Why have one super fancy ship when, for the same price, you could buy six normal ships and expand your reach and cargo capacity more?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-07-21T01:03:30.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Caitlyn is the one that made me bring up the mid-20th century.  I think we can agree she's the lowest tier of the Piltover tech champions.  i mean, technically Janna is Piltover now.  But she's magic god thing.  So whatever.\n\nBut Caitlyn is using a rifled sniper with a three lens magnifying scope.  That's strictly WWII tech.  \n\nWhich can probably just be explained away with the good old fashion: writers have no sense of scale.
