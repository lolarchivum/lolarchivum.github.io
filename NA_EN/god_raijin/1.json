Obviously, this could end up shifting the meta toward mostly playing champions that have knockups etc, so basically it would make the most sense to either nerf knock-ups across the board, or...just make knock ups affected by tenacity.....like they should be at this point in league's stage of development, because there is so many of them.\n\nAt the end of the day, Knock up or not, I'm personally in the boat that ALL hard CC is too powerful.

Most champions have a slow and a knock-up whereas older champions had a cavalcade of CC. Some had snares, blinds, roots, etc.\n\nEmpowering tenacity will not solve much, nor will nerfing \"hard cc\" that's not displacements. All it will do is make that 25/75 split turn into 5/95.
