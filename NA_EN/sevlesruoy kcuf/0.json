The enhanced attack lasts 5 seconds after being seen by an enemy champion.\n\n1. AD reduced to 50 from 55.\n\n2. Lethality decreased to 15 from 18.\n\n3. Nightstalker damage changed to 25 - 250 (based on level) from 30 - 200 (based on level).\n\n4. Slow percentage decreased to 75% from 99%.\n\n4. Slow duration increased to 0.5 seconds from 0.25 seconds.\n\n5. Blackout passive: Removed.\n\n5. Gold cost decreased to 2700 gold from 2900 gold.\n\nBasically, less damage early on so you don't get 100-0 once the enemy has Duskblade and you get snowballed on, little bit less armor pen so squishies can actually buy armor that matters and removing the free Sweeping Lens (Duskblade will still tell if you're in a bush that's warded so you can still pick up a Sweeping Lens and use it it in conjunction with that).\n\nTo compensate, you get more utility in a slow that lasts longer (albeit, it's total slow is reduced by a little bit), little bit more damage on the passive late game so you can fulfill your job and assassinate the backline, and you can get it just a little bit cheaper.\n\n> \n> What i mean by ward camo is making it so, during the shield duration of edge of night, wards dont see you but players can.

Don't need to sacrifice anything.\n\n1. They get AD, which, not only increases their auto attack damage but also makes their spells (which have incredible ratios) deal even more damage.\n\n2. They get armor pen, which, makes them deal even more damage.\n\n3. They get cdr, which allows them to spam their shit more often.\n\n4. They get EVEN MORE damage, if the previous wasn't enough.\n\n5. They get minor cc so enemies can't just escape them.\n\n6. They get a free Sweeping Lens.\n\nAll of this for less gold than anyone else.\n\nYes, it's going to get outscaled in the late game, but games are getting shorter and shorter so this late game doesn't happen half the time.\n\nWith the massive damage on Electrocute (which is getting nerfed, I know) and Ignite, early snowballs are incredibly important, moreso than scaling, and Duskblade does everything to increase early snowballs.\n\n> You bring it up to a &quot;proper&quot; price point of 3200g, you end up with an additional BF sword added to the recipe and 80+AD. \n\nHow does a 300 price increase warrant a 40 AD buff?\n\n> \n> _______________________________________________________\n> I iterate again, the damage proc (and in your argument... the stats of the item itself) of dusk blade is fine and balanced. What makes it overly strong is the blackout passive, which is a result of riots ongoing war on vision.
