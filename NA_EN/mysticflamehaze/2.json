With the number of double/triple crits that I see happen in LoL I have a hard time believing this is the case.

Marksmen, however, get the item for the stats more than the passive and will continue to do the bulk of their damage via consistent autos, even if the passive cooldown is increased.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-12T20:45:42.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":":P marksmen buy assassin items because assassin items give them more attack damage, but they cant buy 6 assassin items without sacrificing their role so really if you take all of the assassin items and remove penetration and attack damage and movement speed  and start over new there'd still be players who value assassin items over marksman items on a ranged champion. league is set up to where anyone can buy anything in the game and i like that about it\n\nsmite for example is so nit-picky about what a player can and cannot buy that it could be played by lee sin in the dark without turtle beaches. that game separates every character into magic or physical and ranged or melee. then from there you can buy only items of your 2 classes.\n\nleague on the other hand doesnt do that and im glad it doesnt because that stifles creativity and makes every game feel the same.\n\nchampions are created in league so far with just ranged vs melee to determine their items. with hydra and runaans being the only locked item besides smite sticks that build from machete.\n\ni think the real problem is that while this one item is made specifically for assassin's the fact is that this game promotes free will and as long as an item has more damage than another item with 6 item slots to fill it's going to show up on players builds. a really good way to fix this issue would be to offer items that marksmen would rather buy over this item. currently many of the stats in game dont feel as powerful as \"deleting\" an enemy with a single basic attack or Q. if the stats on our masteries could somehow end up on items like putting fervor on a new item that grants 20% attack speed or something and we lowered base attack speed on all items overall so that 2.5 was harder to hit for marksmen we could start dropping base numbers on a lot of items and marksmen physical damage scalings to make attack speed and critical be more important on their builds. then assassin's could buy their high damage items and marksmen could buy their high attack speed items and some of the players who like hybrid assassin marksmen would pick from both trees.\n\ni'll give you a chart of items and stats and show you what i mean. this is going to seem like a wall of text but i hope it helps me express my views.\n\n\nwhat marksmen are expected to want - attack speed, critical, attack damage, movement speed.\nwhat assassins are expected to want - damage, penetration, cooldown reduction, movement speed.\n\nsee the problem? let me elaborate.\n\nattack speed {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3078}} \n\ncritical {{item:3508}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3185}} \n\nattack damage {{item:3153}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3104}} {{item:3004}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3185}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} \n\nmovement {{item:3504}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3137}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3512}} \n\nnow just looking at those items minus boots in movement - we can see what would be on a marksman's to buy list. if an item shows up more than once it's probably got more chance of being on multiple builds. do you see an item that shows up more than once?

I think the general itemization goals of the classes are:\n\n**Marksman**\n\n* Goal: Deal the most amount of sustained damage possible (primarily through autoattacking)\n* _Stats to aim for_\n * Attack Damage, Attack Speed, Critical Chance/Damage (because they all multiply together for increased DPS) \n * Armor Penetration (usually % as Marksmen are often only able to safely attack tanks first, and are best suited to taking them down due to their sustained damage, but flat is fine or better if no one is stacking armor)\n* _Stats that are useful but not required_\n * Lifesteal (to last longer, does not directly increase damage)\n * Movespeed (helps positioning/kiting and general map movement, etc)\n\n**Assassin**\n\n* Goal: Take out a single, priority target quickly (primarily through a combo of skills with a few auto attacks and skills that let them get away)\n* _Stats to aim for_\n * Attack Damage\n * flat Armor Penetration.\n* _Stats that are useful but not required_\n * Cooldown Reduction (Getting more combos off is useful, but your _primary_ goal is to kill in one combo.)\n * Movement Speed (You will generally be trying to flank, but move speed is always useful for map movement, etc)\n\nWith those in mind, you can see why the normal builds are _supposed to be_ something like (in no particular order):\n\n**Marksmen**\n\n* One or both of {{item:3031}} {{item:3508}} \n* One or occasionally two of {{item:3087}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3094}} \n* {{item:3006}} \n* One of {{item:3033}} {{item:3036}} or one of the flat penetration items if there is not much armor being built.\n* One or occasionally two of {{item:3153}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3139}} \n\nIf a further defensive item is needed, it can fill the last slot.  Otherwise expect two of one of the above.  Obviously, this is a generalization that applies to Marksmen with little to no ability damage.  The flat armor penetration comes in where there starts to be a higher percentage of non-scaling ability damage compared to basic attack damage.\n\nTo your point about wanting to build flat damage items, I think there are a lot of factors to consider.  In theory, the 2.5 AS 100 AD and 1.0 AS 250 AD builds have the same DPS, but the issue is how reliably you can get each of those attacks off.  In reality, AS has very non-linear effects on your damage, where you either get another attack off or you don't.  Also, team comps must be considered.  If you have to be too wary of an assassin or mage, you will have less opportunity to get attacks off, so you need to make each one count.  Big damage numbers are also funner to see, regardless of if they give the optimal DPS.  Crit as a stat has a reliability issue until you can build a lot of it, which makes it a weaker stat early.\n\n**Assassin**\n(I don't play assassins, so I could be way off, but these are what I would expect.)\n\n* Boots of choice. I expect {{item:3009}} or {{item:3117}} but could see a defensive boot, if needed\n* Some combination of {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3812}} \n* Defensive or semi-defensive items, if needed.\n\nThere are alternative builds where assassins take {{item:3031}} and/or {{item:3508}} for the extra burst from the criticals, but these are risky, because your burst now partly relies on RNG, and less effective since the removal of crit from Ghostblade.\n\nPersonally, I think truly ranged assassins, as opposed to the similar burst mages, would be a bad idea and thus do not need to be considered in this discussion.  I feel most assassins (AP and AD) are too safe already, but that's less itemization and more kit and probably my general distaste for playing against them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
