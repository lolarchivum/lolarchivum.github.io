This was for balancing they said, you get to be \"THE HEALER\" for those tradeoffs. So Soraka brings to the table: a heal, a delayed hard cc, and a global ult to help out in other lanes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Senna gets all that, AND her shroud, AND damage, AND carry potential, AND a specific AD-Supp item, AND free stats....\r\n\r\nWhat exactly was the point of hitting on my poor healgoat so hard when in turn you give Senna a free pass? Right now I have the most success with taking her to toplane and then abusing the power of a spammable range slow combined with sustain as well as the fact that E is an instant damage cast that's hard to avoid. I literally have to pick THE HEALER-CHAMPION for everything in her kit that's NOT HEALING. Meanwhile Senna...\r\n\r\nAnd it feels even more like she was just made to spite support mains for the fact that her entire kit completly lacks internal synergy. NONE of her abilities actually work with each other in a relevant way. It's just a pile of \"how much bullshit can we randomly stack on this champion and oh wait and let's give her enough extra-healing on the side that she can out-perform a Soraka during lane-phase\". Look even the most basic champions have at least SOME sort of internal plays going on, from the typical \"hit your skillshot then follow up\" to \"weave your basic attacks right between abilities\" depending what sort of champ it is. Meanwhile Senna does... nothing of that sort. You can click your Q wherever, none of your kit actually cares if you hit that E or not, and none of your skills is in any way connected to the cloud. \r\n\r\nAnd to top it all off: the clunky attack animation that just feels REALLY weird combined with the fact that she just does not fulfill the \"I got the BIG GUN!\" fantasy that comes with such weaponary. You should have just made her a mage, sort of a cross between Ezreal, Veigar, and Xerath... but like this? Just bad design. Turns out that \"needs to dou lane with lucian and have references to him and thresh\" is NOT a solid basis for actual good design who could have known?! Next time base your goals on actual gameplay and don't take a lazy shortcut because then THIS happens.\r\n\r\nTl,dr for Senna: looks good visually, fails miserable mechanically - and that failure has to be grossly overcompensated with free stats and other nonsense that's just insulting to everyone who actually plays a \"normal\" champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2019-12-01T02:37:42.019+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm close to 1 mill points on Soraka and have been playing her since season 5, and I agree with most of what you said.\n\nI'd be fine with Senna if she didn't do as much damage. I love the utility Senna brings to the table. I don't want that touched. I want her damage nerfed.\n\nSenna's heals aren't as good as Soraka's, but that's a stupid defense because _nobody's_ heals are better than Soraka's. Her whole champion identity is healing, so I would HOPE that nobody's heals are better than Soraka's. For the love of God, don't give the design team any more bad ideas you guys.\n\nThe issue is that Senna's heals aren't far off from Soraka's, while she's doing an insane amount of damage.\n\nIt's the same problem as with Yuumi. You can't completely erase a champion classes' weaknesses. It just doesn't work out.\n\nEnchanters are vulnerable and don't do a lot of damage. That's their trade off for having high levels of utility. When you give them no interaction like with Yuumi, they're broken. When you give them damage like with Senna, they're broken.\n\nIt's not a difficult concept to understand but one Riot seems to always be pushing against lately. They don't know how to create enchanters anymore.\n\nIn my opinion Senna can be saved. She doesn't need to be permanerfed like Yuumi or permabanned like Pyke. If they just tone down her damage, she could do fine, but then that takes us into the bigger issue that we're all kneecapped as supports now thanks to the items changes that were created because of mage supremacy developing bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2019-12-01T14:40:26.647+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baby Ghoul,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YL6bpilf,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-12-01T02:37:42.019+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n> It's the same problem as with Yuumi.

Don't believe me lets do the math?\n\nLets take Sona for example\n\n\nSona- Heals with W, costs 80 mana and heals 30 rank one, and shields for 25. The heal can hit 2 targets (One has to be sona) and the shield is realisitcally only going to hit her and her adc in the early game).  This means that with rank 1 W sona can produce a 'net health difference' of 55 on any one target, if shes in a 2v2 she can make a 'net health difference' of up to 110 (assuming all damage is distributed evenly breaking both shields which is highly unlikely) \n\nNow lets look at Senna... \n\nSenna does 40 HP and healing and 50 damage to whoever her E is hit by. Much like Sona her Q will always hit herself. This means that Senna can make a 'nethealth' difference' of 90 in a 1v1 where its just her and another target, in a 2v2 setting Senna can make a net health difference of either (90, 130, 180) depending on if her both members of the enemy botlane are hit and her ADC (Unlikely) or if she hits her ADC and the enemy ADC (Not unreasonable in coordinated play).  \n\nNow knowing this it may seems that sona and senna are roughly = in a 2v2, afterall 130-110 isn't awful especially when the 110 is more reliable. Well no, because Senna gets q level 1 and Sona can't even take her W till level 2. This means Senna will have either her W for a AOE root, or her E for stealthing, movespeed, or general utility. Additionally the Senna W does the same damage at rank 1 as Sona Q at rank 2.  Because she can take it early and has so many other power outlets in her kit its clear that Senna's Q is better. \n\n\nThis clearly ignores some factors, mainly Sona's powercord and her Q hitting two targets and the onhit damage from the auto it provides. However its kind of difficult to calculate the value of Senna's passive considering A) all the stats it gives and B) the actual value of the % health damage changes from champion to champion and based on starting item choices because its max HP damage. That being said the lowest CD in Sona's kit is 8 second and the fastest is 10s, she must cast 3 spells for a powercord so unless she has one prepped and is casting another the quickest she can use her passive early is 8 seconds around 10 seconds (if she uses her Q W and E) or 18 seconds (if she goes Q W Q). Senna's passive is on target CD so she can use it once on the AD and support and refreshes every 4 seconds. ADDITIONALLY Sona has to choose to use her passive for damage or utility where Senna utility is freely given to her in her W and E along WITH her damage on the Q and passive.  Even at level 6 i'd say AOE CC and global map pressure with nearly GP like levels of agency are about even.\n\nThis kinda devolved into an analysis of Sona VS Senna as a whole more than just there W's but I think the points fairly well explained. Senna is objectively stronger, theres FAR more power in her kit especially early game and unlike Sona theres very little if any trade off for it.  If I had to suggest a fix I'd turn her passive damage into % current hp, and change her Q healing on herself. Make Senna's Q heal her for a % of healing done to allied champions.  if She q's you in a trade and ONLY you she doesn't heal period. If she q's her ADC for 40 HP she heals 20.  I think it'd make her alot healthier to play against and more skill expressive.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-12-01T14:50:05.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuthianDelphi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YL6bpilf,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2019-12-01T03:50:54.119+0000)\n>\n> Senna Q is just barely worse than nami W and much safer to use, compared to the other enchanters who can heal in lane its objectively better. Don't believe me lets do the math?\n> \n> Lets take Sona for example\n> \n> \n> Sona- Heals with W, costs 80 mana and heals 30 rank one, and shields for 25. The heal can hit 2 targets (One has to be sona) and the shield is realisitcally only going to hit her and her adc in the early game).  This means that with rank 1 W sona can produce a 'net health difference' of 55 on any one target, if shes in a 2v2 she can make a 'net health difference' of up to 110 (assuming all damage is distributed evenly breaking both shields which is highly unlikely) \n> \n> Now lets look at Senna... \n> \n> Senna does 40 HP and healing and 50 damage to whoever her E is hit by. Much like Sona her Q will always hit herself. This means that Senna can make a 'nethealth' difference' of 90 in a 1v1 where its just her and another target, in a 2v2 setting Senna can make a net health difference of either (90, 130, 180) depending on if her both members of the enemy botlane are hit and her ADC (Unlikely) or if she hits her ADC and the enemy ADC (Not unreasonable in coordinated play).  \n> \n> Now knowing this it may seems that sona and senna are roughly = in a 2v2, afterall 130-110 isn't awful especially when the 110 is more reliable. Well no, because Senna gets q level 1 and Sona can't even take her W till level 2. This means Senna will have either her W for a AOE root, or her E for stealthing, movespeed, or general utility. Additionally the Senna W does the same damage at rank 1 as Sona Q at rank 2.  Because she can take it early and has so many other power outlets in her kit its clear that Senna's Q is better. \n> \n> \n> This clearly ignores some factors, mainly Sona's powercord and her Q hitting two targets and the onhit damage from the auto it provides.

Senna is better in reality because her power budget is budgeted well, where as sona has been repeatedly nerfed to keep her auras. Sona has needed a full rework and redirection for years.\n\nThat being said, sona is still the better healer, as her heals are a much lower CD and raw power than sennas. Sennas heal is theoretically better in a world where she constantly hits 4 team members and gets to auto every time she can, but thats not realistic.","replies":[{"poster":"LuthianDelphi","date":"2019-12-01T15:16:48.172+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Q is actually better than Sona W provided They’re both hitting their adc. That’s true at early ranks atleast, Sona also can’t spam W in pi lane w/o going oom and if the issue with her power budget is auras then there’s obvious work arounds.

The 2013 rework did deliver on this, but the numbers were so poorly executed. Then Riot broke her arms and legs in Season 6, and that was Soraka's downfall.\n\nSoraka needs buffs, and power budget re-adjustment, to keep her in line with Senna and future enchanters. The game has changed and the standards for powerful and viable champions have changed since Soraka was last tweaked in a meaningful way. \n\n___\n\n**What i would do is:**\n\nRevert her Q to its Season 5 state, but preserve the low mana cost and increase the AP ratio. Her Q will also heal her from jungle monsters. Successful center hit will reduce the cooldown of Q by 50%.\n\nRemove the heal-over-time mechanic and convert it into a flat heal. Both self heal from Q and allied heal from W. Or, add mana regeneration to it, as she was the first and only champion to be able to give Mana to allies.\n\nRemove the damage on her E, and instead make it act as a damage amplification zone. Meaning, all enemies standing in the zone will take increased damage from Soraka and her allies. The damage amp zone will presist after the root takes effect.\n\nAnd finally, add a bonus passive: Soraka converts a % of her AP into Health.\n\n___\n\nThis rework will cement Soraka's place as the Healer Mage DPS of the game, and will give her new, clear and viable playstyles, while still preserving her identity and  everything Soraka mains like about her. She will no longer be just a one sided one dimensional bot lane slave. And perhaps, if my list of changes go trough, she will once again be a viable solo laner and maybe even jungler.\nOne can only hope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnubisDeathtouch","date":"2019-12-02T07:26:10.375+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be slightly off topic, but it is another annoying advantage that Senna has over every other champ in her general class:\nI just discovered that Senna's gun bypasses windwall.
