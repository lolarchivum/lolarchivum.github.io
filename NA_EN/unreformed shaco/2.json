It's a knock back unless he hits that person into another person in which they get knocked up. This is a healthy mechanic which only happens if you are a skillful Lee player or they just happen to line or group up in which should not be happening just like you are playing against any other wombo champion except lee kick is easier to not get womboed by. \n\nYou say they get knocked up/root etc \"AGAIN\", but you only get knocked up once. He doesn't cc the same champion twice.\n\nHis kit only allows for an easy slow early game but when teamfighting comes around, if he ward hops into your team to slow he is taking a lot of free damage. The slow isn't huge. It's a 20% slow level 1 and max level it is 60%. The slow lasts 4 seconds but decays over the 4 seconds. That's not that big of a slow.\n\nThe only reason crit isn't optimal now is because lethality is broken. Lee sin isn't broken. Just because lee sin may be annoying to you doesn't mean he's broken.
