First of all, in 6.13 I need to predict where enemy will be in next 0.85s in order to land W, moreover, my enemy has even more time of awarness, cse I must land E first.\n> In 6.14 I need to predict where enemy will be in next 0.85 + time of vector casting(aka click and drag which is like 0.35-0.45 sec I guess in skilled hands) which bring us enormous 1.2-1.3s of prediction. \n> And here even more. With vector cast, casting spell OUTSIDE of MAX range force champ to go into it(max range) to cast spell, while casting it same way with double cast make champ to cast it IMMEDIATTLY at MAX range... Obviously, that change mess up a lot of combos, cse you accidentally cancel your W cast with E or Q\n\nBut I guess I'll explain it more. Again.\n\nOne current problem is the fact that the target reticle doesn't match what the skill does. It's clear that this is a result of laziness.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that the skill doesn't give the player the option to knock people vertically upwards anymore, which restricts the freedom. If you're wondering why you would want to do that, read what people have to say in the other topic. \n\nAnother problem is that it doesn't mesh with Taliyah's playstyle. She's a roaming movement speed-based mage that has to move all the time. The time it takes you to click and then drag is already too much time wasted when you're trying to hit someone like Hecarim. The old W lets you select an area of the ground and whether or not you wanted to, you can push, pull, or shove to the side. There is a huge difference and I noticed right off the bat. \n\nHonestly, the change just isn't good because it's so lazily implemented. I'm not saying Vector Casting is bad, but Taliyah's W needs a completely different casting control scheme at this point because it doesn't fit Taliyah at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-07-14T22:15:21.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It's clear that this is a result of laziness.\n\nLaziness and having a different set of priorities than you think they should are NOT the same thing.

It sucks, yup. Want a hug? I'm down for giving the people who got used to it hugs (virtual hugs but still), seriously. There's real and justified frustration and pain there, absolutely.

The post you quote is actually one of my major problems - it definitely does not take me anywhere near .25~.35 seconds to vector cast Taliyah's W. It's instant. With smart cast with indicator on you can literally press W and flick your mouse and release W and you're done - MAYBE, just maybe .1 second longer than normally casting a spell, but it's not challenging at all to cast the spell faster once you're familiar with the paradigm.\n\nNot liking a change because it feels wrong or is different from what you experienced before is fine, but there are people all over the threads claiming she's ruined and dead and she's gonna lose 10% more winrate and..,\n\nTo be clear, I don't mind that there are people unhappy about vector cast - lots of changes happen in this game every day that I disagree with. But most of the posts supporting the other side use logic and \"math\" that is completely made up.

I have plenty of practice with his vector casting and it's one of the quickest and easiest skills to cast to me, specifically beuacse im used to it.\nWhen Taliyah came out and I tested her on PBE, I was shocked and confused that her W didn't already have vector casting, because, at least in my opinion, that would be the simplest way to throw someone. I actually stopped playing her because I couldn't get the W to do what i wanted to, and I repeatedly tried to cast it like Viktor's E.\n \nObviously i had no practice with Taliyah's original W, so i was bad at it. If you really do enjoy playing Taliyah, you'll just have to get more practice with the casting and you'll eventually see its quick and fluid, perfect to be running and jumping around with. No vertical knockup will definitely be missed, but it just may be worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jynweithek","date":"2016-07-15T17:05:03.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing, though: Unlike Viktor and Rumble, Taliyah's W has a delay before actually knocking people away, part of this being visible to the enemy. Vector casting makes sense on an almost instant damaging spell that travels in a line, but not on a time-sensitive, ground-targeted circle with a delay. The fact that the casting doesn't start until you release W as opposed to before where it started on press-down, means that another layer of prediction is involved of the Taliyah player on top of the already existing delay. It makes it worse in clutch situations(by a lot), which also means it's a worse ability now in higher levels of play. Other than that, Viktor or Rumble hardly ever need to cast their spells in max range, while Taliyah needs to more often, especially if you've internalized the range.\n\nAlso, the lock-out removal essentially makes her a bad Viktor clone with a burst-mage profile, an unreliable combo and semi-global non-damaging ult. Before, landing her E>W required planning, zoning and outplaying/outsmarting your opponent because it was so telegraphed, so the interaction was very engaging and offered counterplay for the opponent. Now you rely more on dumb luck, because if you land the W you land everything else, and her W is unreliable/easily dodged.\n\nIt's not only a question of having to learn a new way of casting(which I think many Taliyah players won't mind) it's that it's now inferior when mastered compared to the old one when mastered. It's also not about which casting is better overall, it's that the old W casting was a better fit for a spell like that, because it's a spell that's different from Viktors and Rumbles spells, even if they can be cast in the same way. If you want to try a simulation of how it feels for a Taliyah main to cast the new W, try playing a champion with skillshots you know very well(except for Viktor and Rumble), and enable quick-cast with indicator on all spells.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-07-14T22:00:38.987+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, I was very vocal about not changing to vector cast, and I still don't like it, but the reasoning made sense if you actually read Zenon's post. Vector is, strictly speaking, a faster input method, since it requires one button press and a mouse movement, instead of two button presses and a mouse movement. The reason they changed to vector was to complement the fact that Taliyah no longer had a lockout on her other spells, and, while it is not absolutely necessary (you can still hit WEW in the delay time), it's just faster.\n\nPersonally vector cast still makes no intuitive sense to me, so I still can't play it. On the plus side, if I ever invest enough time to learn it, I'll be able to play Viktor and Rumble as well, who are two champions I've always wanted to play but never could because of vector casting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-07-14T22:00:19.349+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pretty much this. \n\nIntroducing an entirely new casting paradigm over the already-existing cast-and-release method of vector casting was a mistake.
