My problem is that it completely screws *me* over as a player. I go onto league with a specific champion and lane in mind. That is what I want to and intend to play. *Only that*. Teambuilder was my dream come true in it's complete and utter entirety. I could work on and practice a specific champion day in and day out forever without having to deal with the problems of blind pick. Now with the new queue, all I want to do is that. I queued multiple times in the past hour or two and only got my *primary role* maybe twice out of 5-7 queues. I don't even necessarily want Teambuilder back, I just want a ***100% guarantee*** that I will get my champion and role every time. Teambuilder did that, and that's all I ever wanted in league. Now it's tossed out and I'm at a loss. I don't care if I would have longer queue times. *I have that right now. Except I have no assurance that I will get what I want.* I don't play league first and foremost for the team. I play for myself. I don't enter a queue thinking \"How can I help my team?\". I enter thinking \"I want to play X champion in Y position.\" This new queue makes that impossible. I am new to Ahri. All I want to play right now is Ahri mid, so I can practice and get better at her. Making me split my chances between two roles makes practicing a champion, especially if that champion only has one truly effective role, almost if not entirely unreachable.\n\nPlease Riot, bring back Teambuilder. If that can't happen, put a \"single role only\" function into the current queue system, or something similar. I can't understand why the Normal, *casual* queue system has to force you into two roles.

A slight modification for it for normal blinds will allow for a near perfect rendition of the teambuilder experience, the difference being a need for the ability to leave the team before matchmaking without forcing everyone back into queue.  The way to do this is to set it to not find an opposing team until the team is fully built in blind mode.   Also for team building you'd need to be able to select only one role and champ, then done.\n\nThose changes make this champ select work just like the teambuilder and you still get to keep the cleaner interface.  By replacing both teambuilder and blind picks with a modified version of this the different queues no longer struggle against each other thus making each one longer.  It also doesn't put the power to kick a member in the hands of one person, instead if several people don't like a specific champ that joins their team they can just leave it it shuffles new players into those spots as needed.  Performing offmeta team builds just requires the coordination of the groupies, not hard, just different.\n\nSo, keep up the great work Riot, now that we have this done can we get the reworks on Taric, Yorick, and Urgot done soon?

He said sure i main ahri mid, so no problem, ill adapt to the team. Was real cool, never had a team actaully work together in champ select.\n\nThen in game, our lanes had a rough start, but once i started ganking at 6-7 minutes, i made everyones life easier, the only guy who had a problem was lee top vs the teemo, who was destroying him with the Kha camp, but in return, i stole all Khas camps, Dragons, and bot and mids turrets. \n\nAll n all, we had a great game, i finished strong, got my lanes fed up, and most importantly, no one yelled at each other, we all helped each other.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-01-16T18:26:13.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had tons of games like this before this queue came out. 2K games and about 1.7k were like this.
