Unlike previous years, where all the teams were compose it primarily by 5 members, it is clear that SKT is playing with a 6 man unit through all this months, and even on World Championship Easyhoon has been a key member of the team. So, if their victory is achieve, i hope Riot will give this man the opportunity of picking up a champion to have his own celebratory skin on LoL. \r\n\r\nSince this skins are on most of the cases 750 RP range, having an additional one won&#039;t give Riot staff that much work. And it would be a great message about the importance of each member of a competitive team.\r\n\r\nEasyhoon deserves it as much as any other member of SKT, and i hope you do the right thing about it!

Not only do they rely on Bjergsen to carry, they rely on him to make the decisions as well. On a team that's mechanically gifted, that's not a problem (Faker and Marin are both shotcallers for SKT), but when the team built around you isn't up to par, that's just a recipe for disaster.\n\nBjerg is commonly touted as the best player in NA by both NA and EU players.

He is really good, and i really hate it when people overhype because i don't like trashing him. He earned his spot in worlds, almost singlehandedly.

Apart from Bjerg, who really deserved their spots at Worlds? Hai and Incarnation, and maybe Sneaky, along with - arguably - Aphromoo and Doublelift. That's really it, honestly. The entire TSM squad apart from Bjerg really showed their weaknesses, Zion/Pobelter/xmithie showed that, while good, they weren't world-class material, and Balls only got that one Pentakill before becoming largely useless again in the second week. I mean, Zion didn't even do that bad, but he evidently couldn't tango with Smeb, and only did well against FW and PaiN, who aren't exactly the best teams - and even faltering somewhat against Steak (though Steak did really well overall, considering the rest of his team's performances).\n\nAnyway, that's besides the point, really, since Lustboy and Dyrus retired, and Santorin went back to school. So the onus wasn't really on TSM as much as it was their individual decisions. However, their decision to remove Turtle from the main roster? That was a good sign. Showed that the organization knows they have to rebuild TSM from the ground up around Bjergsen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2015-10-27T17:23:17.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Westdoor deserves a mention too; his laning may not be the greatest consistently, but he did give Faker a good beating and his teamfighting is fantastic.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Iccy","date":"2015-10-27T19:33:32.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say Bjersen mainly for the influence he has in NA, I wouldnt but him up in the \"one of the best in world\" category and but he does have success internationally (TSM won IM i belive this year).
