Can you touch up some of the older legendary skins?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":152,"down_votes":2,"body":"I know there&#039;s a lot of legendary skins with very hefty price tags on them (20.00), but some of the older ones aren&#039;t up to par with the new ones. Maybe instead of releasing 750 skins with no particle changing effects and animations, you should revisit some of these classic skins to give them a better feel for the people who have spent lots of their money on them. I was gifted Alien Invader Heimerdinger, and I just ended up feeling disappointed. It changed nothing but the model and the turrets and left me feeling unsatisfied. At lease give us something pretty to look at for such rarities. Some of the &quot;Ugliest&quot; skins in league happen to be legendary, as they don&#039;t have the excuse of being &quot;cheap&quot;. They come off as outdated and ugly to look at.\r\nFor Example: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8svC76Vaqmw/hqdefault.jpg\r\nNobody likes this skin, as it has nothing changed except the base model... and It costs $20.00. Imagine all of the things you could buy for $20.00! Lunch at an expensive restaurant, new clothes, 5 league skins, and In Canada you can buy... well... not much. Anyways, all jokes aside; instead of releasing skin after skin, maybe Riot should revisit some of the Legacy/Legendary skins, and keep them up to date with the current Graphics and price Value. Riot, We are giving you our money; just give us something pretty in return. \r\nhttp://i.qkme.me/3pnhdz.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Rendarkan","date":"2016-06-14T20:57:30.306+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes...

The rest are some of *the* original legendary skins when they were still fleshing out the skin system, so things like minor remodels (Tibbers with rabbit ears, Magnificent TF, Red Baron plane, Ice Toboggan Luge, Alien head and turrets) and special particle effects (Firefighter's water, Lion Dance's fireworks) were enough to earn them an 1820 price tag. Since those days, skin quality has vastly increased due to Riot's technology, their increased personnel, and their better funding, so naturally, older skins won't seem up to par anymore. That being said, most of the very antiquated skins that do not have anything fancier than remodels are retired.\n You must understand that when these skins were first coming out, a \"skin\" was usually a very light retexture of a champion, so anything more required a lot more effort on a game company that was still up and coming. Furthermore, Riot's stance on skin pricing is generally set in stone. They don't permanently lower skin prices because it devalues the skin for players who back then may have purchased it at full price. So while it sucks that you don't get as much bang for your buck with these skins, they are the epitome of vintage and most are super rare on account of being vaulted. The only ways to get most of these skins that are vaulted is either through a very special event that releases them (champ relaunch, holiday, legacy event), mystery gifting, or Hextech Crafting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2016-06-15T12:48:47.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I7A6X2v2,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=scMWghhk,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-06-14T21:26:19.902+0000)\n>\n> Here is the list of those &quot;legendary&quot; skins, all of them released between 2010 and 2011.\n> \n> CORPORATE {{champion:36}} \n> RED BARON{{champion:42}} \n> GENTLEMAN {{champion:31}} \n> NUNU BOT {{champion:20}} \n> BROLAF {{champion:2}} \n> ANNIE IN WONDERLAND{{champion:1}} \n> MAGNIFICENT{{champion:4}} \n> FIREFIGHTER{{champion:18}} \n> ALIEN INVADER {{champion:74}} \n> LION DANCE {{champion:96}} \n> Ice Toboggan {{champion:42}} \n> \n> ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ none of those skins worth 1820 RP...\n> \n> Those skins must receive an update or a price reduction imo, they CANT compete WITH REAL legendary skins like dragon trainer{{champion:18}} , DUNKMASTER {{champion:122}} or any REAL legendary skins released AFTER 2011.\n\nlion dance isn't legendary.
