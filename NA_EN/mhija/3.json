I'm giving the fighters no prep time and I'm placing it in Piltover, so city environment with cover. fighters start at just out of Vi's vault breaker range.\n\nThe last time these two fought was when Jinx ran Vi around the Piltover Bank and Vi smashed it to pieces. However this was planned by Jinx who probably knew the lay out well. This put Vi at a severe disadvantage. On the other hand Jinx in that fight was basically toying with Vi and didn't have intentions to kill her, just make fun of her.\n\nThis fight really comes down to \"Can Vi land a hit?\" Because those fists should mean lights out for practically anyone especially someone as skinny as jinx. Even if Jinx is strong enough to carry fish-bones and pow-pow, I don't think it helps her endurance taking a hit, her upper body may be great, but she lacks in the bulk department. If Vi can get in to range to deliver her denting blows then Jinx loses handily. Jinx basically needs to cut through armor with her mini guns and rocket launcher. For the sake of this not being a moot point I'm going to assume hextech technology is good enough to be able to generally be able to block bullets so Vi would be able to block pow-pow with her gauntlets and armor. however Jinx's Zap and flame chompers will make life hell for Vi.\n\nThere is also an argument to be made about temperament. If Jinx got the drop on Vi she probably wouldn't take her out instantly, instead preferring to make fun of her and embarrass her first. Vi on the other hand would certainly be willing to crush jinx given the opportunity. So there might be a bit of over-confidence on Jinx's part could play into Vi's favor.\n\nOverall I give this to Vi. She's generally built for pursuing and her hextech equipment should be able to keep her alive long enough to be in close range. Since the fight most likely would take place in Piltover rather than SR I think that she could also utilize cover. I'm not giving the two any prep time here so Jinx would have to rely on the chompers she brought with her and I don't think that would be enough to stop Vi's charge. I do think this is a close fight, guns are powerful and with the right positioning Jinx could easily pin Vi down into an environmental trap or something else to give her the edge, but I feel her over-confidence and need to make fun of Vi will keep her from fighting as smart as she should.\n\nOne final note on the Super Mega Death Rocket. I didn't really consider that in this fight, because I think it would be powerful enough to level a large building and in the case of this fight it would probably end up killing them both before anything else.\n\nTherefore I think that the winner is {{champion:254}} 60:40 {{champion:222}}","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-11-16T01:36:48.592+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"He's Wiz and I'm Boomstick!\"\n\"And it's our job to analyze their weapons, armor, and skills to find out who would win a DEATH BATTLE!\"\n\"But first: a message from our sponsor: Riot Merchandise Chia Pets.\"","replies":[{"poster":"BugLordekaiser","date":"2016-11-16T03:22:58.716+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-11-15T20:11:52.159+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://38.media.tumblr.com/a172f5a87dfe4af3be7d6333d6dbc20d/tumblr_nkwv21UbqS1u9kkmzo1_400.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mhija","date":"2016-11-15T21:39:45.678+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quite the breakdown!

Jinx can poop on Vi in game, and IRL if it goes to both. Here are the reasons below:\n\nREAL LIFE SCENARIO: When you say Jinx's ultimate would kill them both, wouldn't Vi's fist explode if she charged it that much? I mean, it has the force to. If Vi uses HER ultimate, Vi could easily break her legs as well, the smash would be unbearable for any human, being you can break your legs \nfrom falling off a one-story roof. Jinx uses guns, as we all know. Jinx can easily hide and shoot with pow-pow AND fishbones, a _rocket launcher_ can easily kill Vi in one shot in real life terms, nobody can survive a rocket launcher dead-on, armor or not. Also, if Jinx hits her head its game over. Not to mention, if Jinx hits one circuit KAPOW! Bye Vi!! Also, in the lore, Jinx was perfectly capable of surviving on her own alone, (IN ZAUN!!) while being wanted by Vi and Caitlyn, the two SHERIFFS of one of the biggest places known to the LoL community. One bullet can smash bones through a bullet proof vest, let alone three bullets per second, and a rocket launcher. A tank with fatal fists, and a sheriff with a long range sniper (and a point and click ultimate) can't take down a crazy little girl like Jinx. Even in the real law, if a police officer kills a person, they will be arrested for man-slaughter so Jinx pretty much as a win-win IRL.\n\nIN GAME: This would be easy for Jinx. If she has black cleaver or and sort of lifesteal, its a K.O. for Vi. Jinx's reset passive gives her the mobility to DESTROY ANYONE in game. I know Vi's q is super powerful, but if Jinx manages to stay away as she is in the video with her rockets knocking her back, she would poke Vi long distance no problem. Vi's Q is a short range skill shot, while Jinx's w is a little thinner, it is a SUPER long range. If Jinx has the confidence to taunt Vi she has a good amount of self esteem :p. Take into note once again, the two strongest enforcers of Piltover's police cannot catch this little girl even when shes in their own home-town. Vi uses Q, Jinx can counter it with her E or W for the good CC. If Vi uses her E Jinx can throw her E because Vi stands for a little bit while she uses hers. Jinx with her attack speed can shred through Vi no problem.\n\nIn game it depends on skill, but by the facts\n{{champion:222}} 70:30{{champion:254}} (and {{champion:51}} )\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} Jinx main bby &lt;333","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2016-11-15T22:26:19.210+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"How does one pick a favorite child...","replies":[{"poster":"SaroDay","date":"2016-11-15T23:07:49.272+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"VI AND JINX AS SISTERS CONFIRMED???","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2016-11-15T22:54:48.551+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":19,"body":"Vote Jhin","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-11-16T03:42:15.750+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":5,"body":"downvoted to keep post at +4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emojay","date":"2016-11-16T06:25:01.440+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":6,"body":"GREAT!
