I never said toxic. I said Ekko was using an abusive BUILD which forced him into a top pick with other champs that were abusing the same thing until fixed. Fiora, Yi, Yasuo, all abusing the same tank build. They got nerfed, no longer top picks. Ekko is not a contender for a victorious skin by your own standard (which isn't the standard that Riot uses obviously, so your argument is moot there as well). \n\nYou have worked up some imaginary standard that champs get picked for the skin based on their pick rate during season or something. \n\nYou can have 300 upvotes on an opinion here. I was just having a conversation today with a few people on the reddit who think Maokai is a good pick. Basically, I'm saying you speak in hyperbole, are full of shit and don't realize the forum is a very very small vocal portion of the playerbase. Thus, why Riot doesn't bend to the will of the forums whenever they scream for something.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-10-07T09:18:53.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">  Everyone is fucking sick of ekko,\n\n> No, Ekko was a top pick because of an openly abusive build..\n\nThat's what toxic means.

There have been times in the past where champs have been very broken in the past such as season 4 Kassadin and the whole Cinderhulk thing. I will say however; that since those times and maybe actually the juggernauts as well, this game has been cleaner of things that have been genuinely game breaking and unfair to play against. That being said, there will always be an unbalance of quality of champions and certain champs are much harder to balance than others. Such as Vayne, Rengar YASUO, LEBLANC, Xin, and really any other snowballing champs. Those are the kinds of champs that people have a problem with and complain about. Including me, because when one of these champs gets out of hand such as the current vayne who can one shot people later which is you know, pretty stupid. I think that these things need to be dealt with immediately with a giant nerf hammer.","replies":[]}]}
