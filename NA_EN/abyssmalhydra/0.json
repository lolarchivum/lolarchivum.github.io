And as a class what should they excel at?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"I suppose the argument could be made that Juggernauts are a class of characters that vary greatly on the niche they are meant to fill and what they add to a team differs greatly indeed between them, but if skirmishers like {{champion:114}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:24}} are able to enter a lane and bully some of these said Juggernauts and proceed to outscale them then is it really fair to say that juggernauts are a lane-focused class?\r\n\r\nChampions like {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:75}}  have all been around in league since before the concept of a &#039;juggernaut&#039; existed, and from the way each of these champions play  are really very different,  but they lack a specific edge over say someone like {{champion:24}} or {{champion:114}}  aside from being used to counterpick them, which even that doesnt make sense, \r\n\r\nFor example{{champion:122}} &gt; {{champion:114}} / {{champion:24}}  in lane, but {{champion:48}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:420}}  &lt; {{champion:164}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:24}} in most stages of the game, especially when you consider Skirmishers dont trade any tankiness, mobility, or damage really to outshine those other picks, \r\n\r\n\r\nWhich makes me think, what ARE juggernauts exactly? They cant be immobile powerhouses if their damage isnt even that great in comparison, they dont snowball as hard as most skirmishers, they get outscaled by alot of them, and I suppose the only scenario they can really be passed off as &#039;good&#039; in is if they face tanks, but the way their kits work require them to get ahead/fed off those matchups (which isnt normally easy) to be any noticable presence, meanwhile {{champion:114}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:39}} will operate perfectly fine if allowed to free farm/free roam due to them ALSO beating tank matchups. \r\n\r\nEven when you take into consideration Juggernauts build mostly tank, {{item:3071}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3194}}  being a solid go-to build, even when they lack the CC to be an efficient tank, lack the mobility to impact a team fight too heavily, and lack tools like {{item:3078}} and {{item:3748}} to split properly.\r\n\r\nSo im really just trying to ask, what is the purpose behind Juggernauts? And when should they function best, in lane or as late game monsters? They have so many losing matchups and their own design philosophy leaves their gameplay intentionally flawed, as most of these characters have intense scalings and are item reliant yet get outscaled anyways.\r\n\r\nI hope a rioter can say something, maybe Im missing a part of the big picture? but as much as I love {{champion:6}} and {{champion:48}} they will never be as efficient at shredding tanks as {{champion:114}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:164}} despite losing to, being outsplitted, and being outscaled by them even if their kits are designed to make them excel at these things. But it does seem like Trundle at least makes use of himself by adapting into the jungle, would be interesting if more could follow suit.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-06-27T09:40:31.180+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd have to say that it varies, but then again, I also agree that there are clear problems with the way juggernauts scale currently.

The whole aspect of \"Get close to me IF YOU DARE\" makes the knockups/knockbacks hurt juggernauts even more. If there was some way to have juggernauts not be displaced as far or give them some method of getting in and STAYING IN that isn't the diver way of low CD dashes, they'd be much better.

Every source of damage is higher than it should be. This means juggernaut's is higher too, but one of their niches is that their damage is unreliable or requires setting up.

Some don't see play since they operate on the worse end of things, dying before they can reach anyone such as Skarner, pre-buff Mundo and Volibear (basically the ones that can't usually catch their opponent without a Righteous or Predator).\n\nThis is why after Mundo's ult buff he skyrocketed into top tier status.

This includes the firstborn Nasus, who was used as model, the three (four) juggernauts that came with the class introduction update Garen, Darius, Mordekaiser (Skarner) and the champions that were released / reworked thereafter, so Illaoi, Urgot, Yorick and Aatrox. These champions were designed having the juggernaut model in mind. The second is to group up certain champions who are similar but don't belong in other classes. The remaining juggernauts (Udyr, Trundle, Shyvana, Volibear and Mundo) are here because they don't belong anywhere else (besides a bit of vanguard blood here and there) but they kind of resemble juggernauts, and they are not unique enough to justify being specialists. The thing that makes them hard to consider full-fledged juggernauts is the main thing they have in common: they are tanky stat-checkers.

What about requiring two abilities be maxed to approach your full potential on your actual damage skill?\n\nJuggeranuts are mid-game carries.  They are intentionally kept weak during laning phase.  Aside from Darius,  their levels 1-2 are generally pretty poor (illaoi and Yorick at level 1 in particular as they cannot even do anything with key parts of their kit without ranks in multiple skills) and they are some of the most ultimate reliant champions for 1 vs 1s in the entire game.  They typically spike after they get rank 2 ultimate, then after they get the max level scaling on an ability or when it reaches a crucial threshold \n\nFor example, Garen's passive changes massively at level 11, another change is by level 13 for his E, it will out damage simply auto attacking a single target for the duration.

This happens similarly for Garen who maxes Q first and E second (mostly due to it needing level scalings as well in a way that causes it to have exponentially less damage without both levels and skill ranks) despite E being his main damage skill, or Darius who maxes Q, but needs rank 5 of his E for the free armor penetration it provides passively, or somewhat inversely for Urgot who maxes Q to stay relevant in lane, but then cannot afford to max his W for the shield and extra damage/easier passive procs until 13 as well.\n\nBasically, the golden stage of the game for a juggernaut is after they've unlocked the true functionality of their main damaging abilities, which for almost all of them, is right around level 13-14, up until people are reaching 18, full items, and hyper carries and even skirmishers simply out scale them--hard.

'\nI cant comment on Urgot, that champ seems super wonky <.<\n\nI´ve seen Yoricks win in the laning phase by means of sudden all ins, his ghouls hurt a lot if not quickly dealt with.\n\nIllaoi deals a metric ton of damage with her E at any point in the game i´d say having played her, you land that next to a wall with a tentacle around and no one will even dare go near you. \n\nHonestly on Darius? I think his scalings are just balanced around the relative time of the game, his passive is always strong and he only need to be equal in lvls to his opponent for it to be a huge threat.\n\nThe reason he is feast or famine? He can be kited and struggles to do anything at all if he cant reach.......but if he does he is super strong which is why he is played in the botlane right now by people like Faker himself, as a counterpick to other melee there. \n\nDid you watch one of those? One time when faker played it for instance the enemy Yasuo didnt dare go near minions because faker screwed him over each and every time. \n\n\n> Basically, the golden stage of the game for a juggernaut is after they&#x27;ve unlocked the true functionality of their main damaging abilities, which for almost all of them, is right around level 13-14, up until people are reaching 18, full items, and hyper carries and even skirmishers simply out scale them--hard.

Of the midgame and into lategame. .......when she isnt crap.\n\n\nThat is Darius in a nutshell largely to me, but the Juggernaut role is a bit more diverse and i honestly think you´ll have to look at the champs individually more than the role overall.\n\nFor while they share weaknesses their way of working is sufficiently different that some kind of \"overall\" balance change probably wont work.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2018-06-29T10:06:29.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read to here, \"Garen has a level scaling on his E but it.......its really insignificant, 5 up to 10 damage per spin between the lvls of 1-16?\n\nDarius has a bit built into his passive and ulti, however its just set to be right for his lvl so its not really significant?\" then realized you have no idea what you're talking about. \n\nThe amount of times Garen ***SPINS*** changes from ***5 up to 10 times*** in the same duration.

The matchup is mostly skill based with a slight advantage to Darius (he has a 5% lane kill rate advantage on op.gg).

Range isn't one of his strengths and his CD's aren't as long as Burst mages as that would break his sustain.

This is another thing that is Key to a Jugger.\n\nAdditionally Most Skirmishers or Divers, they blow thier damage in a burst and then all they do is AA, or their is mostly AA, they are more single target focused\n\nThe issue is Skirmishers and Diver's sustain/hp, They SHOULDN'T be able out sustain a Jugg if the Jugg gets on them. Thier main forms of defense should come through STONG but short duration defenses, and this is why their sustain needs to be dropped, and also why yasuo's passive shield is an issue.

They don't get to pick their fights, and their dueling is mid-tier between dedicated duelists and non-duelists, but if they get a good flank off and land their combo without being effectively kited, they'll roll over your entire damn team. In many ways they counter hard-engage, since they have the durability to survive the engage and then the damage to slaughter the enemy team once they're in their face.\n\nSkirmishers, on the other hand, are kind of the opposite. They excel at target access (choosing their battles) and at dueling, but in a full blown teamfight, a skirmisher that isn't ahead (or super overtuned) will just be held down have their lunch money taken by a beefy tank + dps. They have some durability, but they're usually dependent on repeated autos/ability use to do their thing, whereas juggernauts tend to have a lot of backloaded burst that will still go off after they're cc'ed as long as they got their first hit(s) off.\n\nSo, for example, a juggernaut is much better to have if the enemy team tries to engage on you when you're fighting dragon/Baron or under your tower, since the fight is on your terms. They complement poke/peel comps by punishing incomplete engage. They'll decide a teamfight if the enemy team doesn't control them. They're more powerful defensively and reactively, since they can punish deathballs super hard.\n\nA skirmisher, on the other hand, is better for a splitpush (or sometimes heavy engage) comp - they'll 1v3 if ahead, but they usually won't decide a teamfight - they'll just make an already decided teamfight worse by instantly sweeping the enemy team. They're better aggressively, and pro-actively, since if they get engaged on they just die, and they're great at punishing a team that's slightly off balance, and caught by surprise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IdveYsUfSK","date":"2018-06-27T16:55:20.151+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Juggernaut is pretty much a class that contains handicapped melee champions that riot doesnt put any effort in reworking their kits other than giving them number adjustments.\nHence their strengths is just to outstat the enemy much more easily.\nBut their current state is so bad that a much superior class of bruisers called slayers which are much more reliable and easy to pull off overshadows them in majority of situations.

Because Riot don't know what to do with the \"frontline\" and as a result have killed off durability. Juggs want nothing more than to be tough enough to merc champs that mess with them  and because they also will cause player retarded screeching when they are viable then they are most of the time left as the semi-viable at best. \n\n\nHere is the deal, there has been a mobility creep and a damage creep, do durability has not been increased at all. Tank items are barely viable and even HP items can't be of use due to not having the resistances needed to back it up and them being nearly useless. In short. Juggs have the damage to keep up but lack the durability and mobility to have a proper place in the meta and have not gained any compensation for it.\n\nSo if Riot want to buff up juggs to becoming balanced then they need to have better durability and utility to compete with the their opponents, Juggs, tanks and even some divers need some buff to durability for them to be able to survive, tone down the game in the game a bit but also increase the defensive might of those champs will make the game more balanced and fun again.

All riot's newby \"roles\" suffer from this kind of poorly-defined vagueness, but Juggernauts seem to be one of the worst at it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-06-28T07:09:03.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said this before... and I will say this again.\n\nRiot's little classifications for champs don't really matter.  Juggernaut, Diver, Skirmisher... etc.  they made these terms up late into the game's life when there were already 100+ champs that existed and had been made before they even CONSIDERED what a juggernaut and a Warden freaking were.  The newer champs follow those roles a little better, but even then, those roles straight-jacket creativity a bit and make it hard to design champions so there aren't really \"typical juggernauts\" or \"standard skirmishers\".  There are a SHIT LOAD of champs muh man... there will likely be more exceptions to the rule and champs that fit it. \n\nThe roles thing was just added as a loosely-applied term to be used by new players to get a VAGUE idea of what a given champ was supposed to do in the game and in fights.  So newbies know that Malphite is supposed to start teamfights not build full AP and pretend he's an assassin and splitpusher.  Or tha Jax is a guy that floats in and floats out picking people up... not a freakin' tank that should be jumping in first and staying there.  \n\nThe roles don't really apply very well... and you shouldn't base your understanding of the champs on them.  Use them as vague baselines for what champions do and then assume that there is a lot more nuance to them if you pick them up and play them full-bore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2018-06-28T06:05:17.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well for one most are much more useful in team fights than especially Fiora.
