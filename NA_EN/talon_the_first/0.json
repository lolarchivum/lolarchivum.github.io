I decided to put the discussion right here too since here is a bigger player base. I would be happy for any comment or vote you could leave. I really like the topic and that is why I wanted to see more opinions about it. Excuse me if my english is not 100% perfect.\r\nBtw in the german boards the &#039;Yes, always&#039; had 50 votes, the &#039;Yes, but not 4 cheaters&#039; had 31 votes, the &#039;Yes, but not 4 flamers&#039; had 6 votes, the &#039;Depending on the circumstances&#039; had 30 votes (including mine), the &#039;Yes, but for payment&#039; had 8 votes, the &#039;No, never&#039; had 38 votes and the &#039;No, only in rare cases&#039; had 11 votes. I left the last option to pick which was &#039;I don&#039;t know&#039; with 5 votes. I find it quite interesting to see that the League of Legends community has such different views of a single topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-07T21:00:27.720+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"Isn't that the point of a 14 day ban?\n\nReform or you end up with a perm ban?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-06-08T09:43:59.869+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is, but 14 days is a fairly short amount of time. It really does take some introspection and growth as a human to not be toxic, and it usually doesnt happen in 2 weeks. In 2 weeks, you havent even had enough time to cool off from getting banned in the first place.\n\nI like the way that Incarnati0n (Jensen) and IWillDominate's toxicity was handled - a 1 year ban. I personally like 6 months as another tier too - its long enough to hurt, but not long enough to create a new account and grind everything back (unless you pay a ton of money for it). That gives you a real reason to want the account back, and enough time to actually think about what happened. \n\nRIght now, I think it goes 10 day chat, 25 day chat, 14 day ban, then perma. I'm for adding further restrictions - I'd like to see a 1 week ban, 2 week, 1 month, 6 month, then 1 year. If you run through all those (so almost 1 year and 8 months of being banned), you probably deserve a perma. Going from 2 weeks to perma is pretty harsh.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-08T13:47:26.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how many warnings will it take before someone decides it's not all about them?","replies":[{"poster":"kms irl","date":"2017-06-09T22:11:51.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are assuming a 100% accurate report system.

Its not as simple as, \"someone **decides** it's not all about them.\" Being able to control your emotions is not something you decide on a whim.

This wasn't behavior in one or two games, but a traceable pattern that goes back a few months. Intentionally feeding, blowing summoner spells at random times, buying multiple boots, multiple tears, teleporting into base and running back and forth and of course, the non-stop pinging that you would do to your team mates. In fact, when you get really upset it looks like you just decide to ping all the time stopping only for the forced cooldown period and then starting back up again. Even when asked to stop you continue to do it for no real tactical reason. Perhaps to force an early surrender so you can get to the next game since you know that pings are not currently mutable?\n\nSeems like a lot more than just spam pinging.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kamadon","date":"2017-06-07T21:05:24.524+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think the whole tribunal System should be reworked.
