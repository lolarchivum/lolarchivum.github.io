If each champion is only eligible for 1 box per season, rather than 1 box per month, then the key fragment drop rates are more understandable.  I don't mind Hextech Crafting being difficult.  I just don't want to end up with a ridiculous number of unopened boxes by the end of the season.  I still do have some concerns, since I doubt that I can get even 1 or 2 key fragments on average per week at the current rate.  I will wait and see before providing more feedback however.\n\nLike a lot of other players, I am getting a lot more box drops than key fragment drops.  Since each box requires 3x key fragments to open, this feels pretty lame.  The key fragments are so rare that I expect myself to be buried in pointless, rotting boxes within a few months.  Something needs to be done.  In my experience, keys need to be 11x more common to reach the number required to open boxes at their current rate.  That seems awfully excessive.\n\nKey fragment drops need to be drastically increased.  Making key fragments a 100% drop from the first win of the day would be great for honest players who aren't willing to resort to botting to grind the ~100 games per key at the current insane rate...  \n\nMaking boxes S and S+ only would also be a good idea.  S- is probably a little bit too easy to achieve to deserve a box drop in all honesty.\n\nI don&#039;t think key and box drop rates need to always balance out, but being skewed so that keys are more than 11x too scarce is beyond ridiculous.\n\nSummary:\n1. Increase key drop rates drastically or reward them for first-win-of-the-day\n2. Stop rewarding boxes for S- rank","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2016-03-30T00:34:11.025+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"You'll be changing your opinion on the S- once you've gotten boxes on your 30+ best champions and need to acquire an S rank on yet another one.\n\nAs for keys: Be aware that the system has only been out for 2 weeks, and yet you could theoretically have 6 boxes so far since you started with 4 available. Going forward, in 2 weeks you would only be able to get 2 additional boxes. Theoretically you should be comparing your current key count to 2 boxes, which if you've received 6 key fragments already you're on track (this is exactly my case, I have 5/6 boxes but only 6 key fragments). \n\nObviously when the system is new and you have all champions available boxes are easier (and I do find key fragments to be too rare), but as the months pass I'd imagine you'll struggle to get all of your available boxes and the keys will eventually pile up.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2016-03-30T01:09:28.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just some context here, I've also obtained 6 boxes so far, but I've only obtained 4 key fragments.  \n\nSome of my impressions may be based on incorrect information however.

So it will definitely get harder as the season progresses.\n\nAlso, boxes are for each S rank, win or lose. Keys are only possible on wins.\n\nWhat that means is, if you're a player who tends to either do really well or really poorly, you'll get those S's easily and get boxes, but you'll also lose a lot and not get keys. If you're playing consistently pretty well but not dominating, you'll have a tough time getting boxes but you should be able to get a lot of wins and improve your chances at keys.\n\nI think we'll have to wait at least 3 months or so to really start forming opinions on drop rates and the like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-03-30T22:13:19.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the decreasing key drop ratio that resets monthly.","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2016-05-15T17:46:50.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may be wrong on this since I'm assuming it from my own experience, but I feel that different ques have seperate drop rates.
