Most games have much lighter punishments to no punishments at all for leaving matches.

And support board has not helped me once in this case. Trust me, I have tried it numerous times. If it would be just my network, the case would be easy, but it is really frequent in games seeing ally or enemy suffering from it. Once I was told to send message to actual Riot dev, but the idiot uses white lists and thus my European email was rejected by white list system. (Computer scientists has long time ago proven that white lists are really really bad idea, but it is really frequently used in USA). \n\nTaking into account how most big companies treat Europe, it is quite likely only affects Europe. IT is also possible that the poor quality of support staff is only European issue. The sad part is Europeans have no other option due American total ignorance of reality. Trump is just pinnacle of this attitude problem. President Truman and Johnsson were good examples of it in the past. \n\n> I have a little knowledge of networking, but probably not as much as you.
