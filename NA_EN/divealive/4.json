This would eliminate the issue with wiffs on terrain angles and allow for a higher skill ceiling.\n\nThe only \"issue\" I could see with this would be largely a balancing thing.

You can only get damaged once on an ability that does flat damage.\n\nThe only reason I gave an either/or is because it is ultimately up to Riot to balance the ability, and most likely if it is a pass through ability it will have a limit to how many times it could proc on a single target (if it is designed to do so) and the damage per pass would be lower, but can stack up fairly high, again, at a limit. If it is deemed to be a single target and not pass through, then it would be more likely for the damage stacking to be a result on how many times it has bounced before making contact with that target, and the total damage would, again, be capped. Also, your statement about being damaged once per ability is false.\n {{champion:103}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:112}} \nAll examples of champions who have abilities that can deal two phases of damage to the same target with a single projectile or skillshot.
