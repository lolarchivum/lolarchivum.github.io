You lowered the growth factor from 3.9 to 3.0, which is a reduction of over 20%. The nerf especially hurts when you consider that FH has become a lot less optimal, both due to going over the CdR cap and due to him scaling worse on mana, and that Zhonya's isn't optimal, either - sustained damage mages do not really like that item's active. \n\nIf it has to do with him getting the passive shield, imo it would be more logical to nerf his innate HP instead of his innate armor. Both a shield and the ult's Spellvamp synergize better with resistances, after all - could that fact exerbated the effect of the armor nerf?\n\nDespite him getting a skillshot, Ryze is still a close-range mage at heart, and needs some kind of defense to survive...","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-05-11T23:52:14.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering why they took out so much of his armor as well.

His new passive is great and I think his over-all kit is more rewarding and skillful (timing is much more important, still very facerolly, but a bit less). His only current problem is that his early game is pretty terrible, especially against popular mages and top laners. His Q could use some better damage, maybe lift the scaling per point spent off of it? Or have the level 1 one be higher? Who knows. But yeah, I feel like people are just trying to faceroll with him and aren't realizing this isn't the old Ryze. You have to time your spells properly and if you get the right combo off you'll deal a lot of damage.

Now that the newness wore off, every top laner knows how and when to strike Ryze. They keep a little away of the minions, generally on the side, either left and right, and strike once we spent our charges. Because they mostly have gap closers, they just win easily. We just went from having absolutely no farm to have like 24 seconds of farm (we need to have at least 2 stacks to be dangerous and keep 3 spells always up for the combo stack - you use q to farm and all the other 2 and R to the end to become the powerhouse).\n\nHowever here's what's currently keeping Ryze on the lowest levels of picking:\n- No sustain - we have no way to refund on mana - we are reliant on items to give us that - and we are reliant heavily on our active abilities to do anything - which ends up consuming a lot of mana.\n- No gap closer/escape alternative - we have nothing that will make us jump walls, skip anywhere, get anyone, nothing. Only our ultimate increases our movement you can be rooted, stunned, etc etc\n- All In strategy - Because we can't control stacks, it's an all in strategy... We can't lose the stacks momentum because once their gone, we have no strategy left, nothing to play on. We need to push back. So in every time, in the game - early, mid or late - once we lose stack control, we have to push back, get our stacks back to 3 so we can put it up. \n\nAnyone who knows Ryze know how easy it is to counter him. If Ryze has no mana, it's a Scuttle Crab. If he has no stacks, go in - he can only root you, at best, which will take like 1 second or less to fade off - and you win the fight.\n\nA mediocre riven can either win the trade or just pull off oh so easily. Irelia, maokai, rumble, fiora, tryndamere, etc, any toplaner has both escape mechanisms or highly counters to Ryze. The only rule of thumb to win against Ryze is: stay away from the minions and keep an eye on his stacks. Once you know this, everything else is easy.\n\nI like the mechanism they gave Ryze, as he can farm better now, but if he is caught anywhere else is lane or any other tower, you are toast.\n\nI would love to take Ryze as a jungler, support or even ADC. This is my champ and I just love him so much. Alas I know that's not possible, but I also know that I am very very limited to what I can do.  As a Top laner, I can't really roam that much, as I am heavily dependant on the farm to keep myself afloat. I can't gap close so even if I roam, my window of helping out is reserved to large mistakes made by the enemy team member, and I really can't sustain myself as my mana regen/refund is crawling unless I have blue buff.\n\n\n\nI really would like to hear from other Ryze players and this is obviously my own (flawed?) perspective of the changes to Ryze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2015-05-13T01:35:55.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main problem with Ryze right now is his Q.\n\nWith the combination of range, windup and missile speed, it's too hard to hit anyone so isn't right on top of you, they can simply walk backwards and it won't hit them.\n\nI'm not saying it needs to become spammable poke, but it really lost a while lot of reliability in the remake...

In lategame he just tried to snack the enemy ADC. His lategame was comparable with Nasus' and Vaynes lategame. \n\nI understand that Riot wanted to create more ways to to play as Ryze but also ways to play versus Ryze.\nThe new passive is nice, but I think turning his Q into a fairly slow short ranged skillshot wasn't the right way to do it. This change hit the hardest. He nearly lost all his dueling power. First you have to charge up (what your opponent will notice), then you have to walk through/around the minions (what your opponent will also notice) and then - finally - you can try to hit your enemy. Oh wait - he pedicted your plan and is out of range/in the minions. Trading without being able to hit Qs isn't worth it. But with his Q being a skillshot it is nearly impossible to hit because you can't reposition as Ryze fast enough. It is not like he is LeBlanc, jumping in, throw a Q and jump back (and you don't even have to worry about missing your spell). \n\nSecond thing is - in lategame he is just stupid - even more stupid than before. Where Non-Ryze players always thought that Ryze players smash their keyboards (which isn't true: you had to add a Q in between each spell and even had to wait a little CD to come off - it was not hitting your keys in a random order), well, now it is! It is nearly impossible to put your spells in a specific order, because you have so little CDs your finger can't react - it isn't challenging anymore. Although his low CDs it feels like it ages to burst an enemy down, because half of your Qs don't hit because of minions and/or Champions inbetween. You can't smash all your buttons and walk around obstacles simultaneosly. And god bless people who don't use smartcast - they will persumably break all their fingers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-05-12T16:55:48.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna go with straight up weak.  Anytime I see a Ryze against me in lane I show zero respect, hell last game I had one in top lane against my Jax and I just took Q level 1 and jumped right on top of him as soon as he tried to hit a minion took him to 50% HP while he only took me to 80%, and most of that came from minion damage.\n\nOnly way Ryze is doing much anymore is if he happens to get a match-up that heavily favors him, IE no way for them to jump on him or they don't out range him, or people just don't bully him like they can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fertsa","date":"2015-05-11T22:54:20.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The statement that new ryze is amazing but just has a high skill cap is surprisingly unpopular.\nI spent a long time on the pbe learning to control the timing of ryze's new passive before he got updated and i personally love how it plays.\nI can explode enemy squishies and tanks alike given the right opportunity.\nand there is where i think people don't like it, \"opportunity\", as in planning, positioning, getting your enemies exactly where you want them before you can be productive.\nEvery person i've gotten into an in-depth conversation about ryze's update tell me they play champions that have extremely high burst only restricted by if they can get in range of their target and that's it, not \"is my passive going to be up when i get there?\" \"will they still be standing in the minion wave?\" \"will they have backup with hard cc?\" and all the other problems that ryze now actually has to worry about.","replies":[{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-05-12T07:11:05.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the problem.

Here are some different options I think might help him:\n\n- Remove CDR from his ulti, replace with bonus tenacity while his ulti is activated\n- Change cast animations so he can move while casting\n- Increase the AoE on his E slightly\n- Give him a small MS increase with each stack of his passive\n- Some way to return mana if he hits/uses spells well\n- During window of power or ulti, Q is not stopped and damages all enemies hit\n- E does bonus damage if AoE hits no other targets\n- Full snare duration on level 1 of W","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-05-13T02:48:52.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the only thing that would be reasonable would be increasing the AOE on his E, but that would accompany changing how many max targets it can hit, lowering it to 4 or 5. This would also probably accompany a slight increase in damage as compensation, but then again it might not. A lot of your other suggestions overload him in my opinion. (maybe giving some return mana wouldn't be too bad I guess; it would have to be situational).\n\nGiving his W full duration at level 1 would make him so oppressive. Ryze's E has always been about hitting multiple targets and shouldn't be rewarded for catching someone away from other units (though I think 200 range is really low for the bounce). MS increase would be too much on top of his Ult MS buff. Removing the CDR with his Ult would restrict his build as he still wants to get high amounts of this stat and he would be forced to take Frozen Heart again and he would still struggle to max CDR. Changing the cast animations so he could move while casting would make him WAY too sticky with the lockdown ability of his W. Right now, he has to stop slightly to cast W for 1.75 seconds of a point and click root that will be up again in less than 3 seconds if you are using your passive well, giving an enemy 1 second of freedom to get away from Ryze. Making Ryze able to hit W while running means that any champion without a potent dash or Flash available would never get away from a good Ryze player. \n\nWhat most people are having trouble with on Ryze is his early laning phase. I really don't know what can be done, but I would think they could start with giving him his armor back, as this was nerfed with his rework. I would be very cautious of overbuffing Ryze at this point though, because I think he might be very strong if played well. That's just my opinion. Don't take my word on it. Good luck out there.

It's very cost efficient. It's just no longer core on him. It used to be that you HAD to build Frozen Heart on Ryze because it was the best item for him to get max CDR. That meant that he had 3 core items and one of them was an armor only item, making him much weaker against high magic damage comps. Before there was basically one Ryze build: {{item:3040}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3102}} this could vary by one item depending on the team comp but this was pretty much the staple Ryze build. \n\nNow there are much more options because he doesn't need Frozen Heart anymore. His E now does %MR reduction instead of Flat, making Void Staff less core (but still a very strong item). His build has just been opened up more. You can still use Frozen Heart as the stats it provides and the passive are all very strong on Ryze. Going over the CDR cap is not always a bad thing if you benefit heavily from the stats an item provides.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-05-12T02:25:37.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't buff him, I think he's reasonably strong and people haven't figured him out yet. The last thing you want to do is buff him and it turns out he was really strong and all your buffs did was push him over the edge. What this leads to is harsh nerfs that probably weren't necessary in the first place had you not buffed him. I think you need to give it time. His skill cap was just raised by an insane amount, people are just beginning to understand him now.","replies":[]}]}
