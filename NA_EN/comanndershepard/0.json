If the majority of Runes were free, you might be able to actually make a more expansive and dynamically interesting system because people would actually have the room and the time to try out all sorts of new combinations. Right now they can't afford to do so because they need to just buy the most efficient ones.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is removing all Defensive runes and leaving just Offensive and Utility runes and making Masteries a lot more about Utility rather than Damage, Tankiness or just flat stats in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Arctíc Monkey","date":"2014-11-17T14:19:49.864+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"One of the reason league is so fun is because you can change the base stats of champs, going into defensive runes allows tanks to scale nicely and be relevant. removing the variation would lead to the league of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-11-17T15:57:20.557+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> One of the reason league is so fun is because you can change the base stats of champs, going into defensive runes allows tanks to scale nicely and be relevant. removing the variation would lead to the league of damage.\n\nThe only problem with that is that there isn't any actual diversity in runes when you allow Defensive ones. There is only diversity when its actually inefficient to run defensive runes in those slots, which is why you see a lot of ADCs pick up CDR or AS instead of MR on Blue. Yellow is a whole different problem entirely since its almost always just Armor and Health. \n\nIn all honesty, Runes and Masteries should be focused entirely on playstyle changes like the canceled Dawngate was going towards. They should not be focused on raw stats unless its specifically for a playstyle and even then the stats should be lessened. You shouldn't be picking Runes so you can \"scale nicely\" when your stats should already be able to do that by themselves in conjunction with items. The fact that most characters can't even handle minions and monsters on their own without a fully efficient rune page is ridiculous to me. \n\nPages should be \"I want to be a skirmisher, duelist etc.,\" not \"I want Armor, AD, more Armor and CDR\"","replies":[{"poster":"Zephyr909","date":"2014-11-17T20:46:15.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the argument against expensive runes. For example, I just finished getting a full set of Hybrid Pen Marks for my Akali page. For those of you who don't know, a full set of Marks is 9 count. How much did that cost? 7,380 IP. Which is more than the most expensive champion. I really don't want to spend that much on a QUARTER of my rune page, it takes way too much time. It took me about 3 months to finish the Hybrid Pen Marks.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sovenance","date":"2014-11-17T14:45:35.144+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last pre-season you guys were teasing a runes cleanup moving utility into glyphs and defensive stats to seals, offensive to marks and then have the quints represent meaningful playstyle choices IIRC - for instance people sometimes run AP glyphs right now which is a confusing design as you're forced to choose between offensive stats (AP), defensive stats (magic resist) or utility stats (CDR) glyphs meanwhile mana regen seals are more efficient than glyphs and so on. I may have missed out on some information, but all I remember was someone stating it would be too much change at once. If this is still something you would like to do, is it at all possible that it would happen before preseason 2016? I for one was very intrigued by the prospect of having clearer decisions to make with the runes and really have them impact my play, because right now it feels like a core set of runes are just best on every champion and building pages to cater to your own playstyle puts you at a slight disadvantage in effectiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2014-11-17T17:52:39.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Last pre-season you guys were teasing a runes cleanup\n\nThis.

Unless you really want to be offensive, utility or tanky then there isn't total need for some of these masteries.
