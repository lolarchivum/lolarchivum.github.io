I really doubt Riot are stupid enough to kill off a champion that *has just been updated*. On top of throwing away all the work, they'd be stealing money from those who have bought stuff. It'd be utter anarchy with the uproar! What I'd love to see is Gangplank being teh first champion to get a second VU in such a short time. Making his original + skins a bit more battered or even Sion-like. Even better, just add a new skin; \"Sea Cursed Gangplank\" or something and make it a legendary! Would be cool if Riot had planned for this and was just waiting for some Player-pushed event to occur (more GP icons, more Graves than TF or something) and would have had 2 skins for GP in the barrel; one as him being \"crowned\" king of Bilgewater and the other as I-Am-Pirate-Sion!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stardust Man","date":"2015-07-29T23:29:46.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot this is bullshit i picked the gangplank path and i cant play him NOW I WASTED MY ICON DANGIT ;(","replies":[{"poster":"EbbSpider","date":"2015-07-29T23:37:08.669+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you and everyone else who chose the GP path is upset, as am I, but let's not get angry over this.

So there is a chance that GP is still alive and now under a debt thanks to the River King. Theory 2: The Summoners at the League of Legends have been informed that one of the Champions, {{champion:41}} Gangplank, is deceased, they then decide to disable him from all matches. Knowing the world of League and the fact that Riot cannot completely get rid of a champion (after all their hard work), the summoners will find a way to get him back in action, dead or alive, his body will probably be taken by the summoners to then later \"Dissect\" him, manage to extract his mind snatching it back from oblivion (like {{champion:268}} Azir) and resume is existence within the League, why do they need his mind? Cause thats how summoners summon and command their champions for battle (From what I remember from reading the lore). So expect him to be back, hopefully not as a ghost as a lot of people are saying, I cant imagine GP as a ghost for the rest of his League career. Plus previous champions have been in a life or death situation, like {{champion:15}} Sivir in Shurima: Rise of the Ascended and in the current story {{champion:104}} Graves and {{champion:4}} Twisted Fate. So remain calm, there will be a saviour in this story too. {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quelib","date":"2015-07-30T00:13:29.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I literally bought him played him once then he died...aw crap this sucks","replies":[]},{"poster":"CooleTeeps","date":"2015-07-29T23:43:23.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I only skimmed through Act 3 so this may be slightly inaccurate)\n\nMiss Fortune destroyed GP's ship, but I'm pretty sure a master pirate like GP could have survived that.
