I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.21 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-721-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a QA Analyst on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s the last patch before preseason! As such, this patch is smaller than normal and features a slight tweaks to a number of champions. We&#039;re making adjustments to Galio, Sejuani, Rammus, Udyr, Urgot, and more. Additionally, we&#039;re knocking Ardent Censer down a peg and helping out Frozen Heart and Tear of the Goddess.  Ask us questions about the patch, or anything else you&#039;re interested for that matter. We&#039;d love to talk with you guys. :)\r\n\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\r\nChristy &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson\r\nChris &quot;Auberaun&quot; Roberts\r\nNick &quot;Endstep&quot; Frijia\r\nNabi &quot;Novalas&quot; Barak\r\nSigmundur &quot;GangIeri&quot; Helgason","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2017-10-24T20:59:57.201+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"first","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-10-24T21:00:43.511+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"this isn't 2007 youtube get outta here","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2017-10-24T21:01:12.697+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"lul you're just 200 and late.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-10-24T21:01:40.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Novalas,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=zzhiQJFF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-24T20:59:57.201+0000)\n>\n> first\n\nwhile totally off topic, do riot members have a 21 char cap on name to include riot_ in the name?","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2017-10-24T21:02:56.166+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, still a 16 character limit.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-10-24T21:25:56.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as we're talking about rioter names... presumably the majority of rioters had league accounts before becoming rioters, so when hired did you just get to take your existing account(s) and stick riot_ in front, or do you get special riot accounts made independent of your personal account(s)?\n\nRelated, when a rioter leaves riot for whatever reason, do they get to keep the account and just be renamed to exclude the riot_ part, or do riot accounts have magic features (e.g. infinite RP/IP or something) that means they stay in company hands?","replies":[{"poster":"Novalas","date":"2017-10-24T21:38:17.343+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think some people make new accounts and others just change their account name.

It's not like all champions can (or should) have the same amount of waveclear, and obviously it's mostly dependent upon what the rest of the kit is, their strengths, weaknesses, etc. In Galio's case, he's a melee without a reliable trading pattern against ranged champions who has very punishable cooldowns. Without some amount of ranged waveclear he'd just get shut out of the game at any point where he fell behind, plus having high damage on the persistent part of the Q means he can have less poke (since champions can just walk away from the Q tornado) and more all-in pressure since he can use his cc to keep people inside the tornado. Galio is also making a conscious choice when he uses Q to clear backline - without it, he has no ranged abilities and has to commit his body to cs the melees and any ranged creeps he didn't kill, or to fight his lane opponent. \n\nIt's also worth noting that Galio is not really a tank. On live (before this patch drops), he's played most effectively as full tank, but after this patch he should be more akin to an AP bruiser, though on the tankier side of those.","replies":[{"poster":"Landorin","date":"2017-10-25T02:35:37.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, doesn't everything you just said about Galio apply to Fizz as well? Yet he doesn't have any ranged waveclear at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-10-25T05:09:23.804+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a complicated question that I probably won't answer as well as a designer could, but I'll give it a go.\n\nHere's the short answer - a lot of the same things are true of both kits, but Fizz is a very different type of champion with different needs and different areas of power. Fizz has an enormous spike at level 6 in most matchups that gives him substantial kill threat on his lane. Galio, on the other hand, only has three abilities and no ultimate in a 1v1 - so a similar question to yours would be why can't Galio use his ult on himself to fight people 1v1? Same reason why Fizz doesn't have ranged waveclear - they're different champions with different strengths and weaknesses. \n\nThe long answer to this question is complex and in some ways has to do with the play pattern of both champions. Fizz is an assassin, and Galio is somewhere between a bruiser and a tank. Even beyond that, Fizz is an extremely snowbally roamer who also has a lot of kill threat 1v1 in many matchups. Galio has relatively lower snowballing potential (though it is higher this patch with better AP ratios) and also has substantially lower kill threat 1v1. Galio typically plays through his sidelanes or jungler, even when he's ahead, whereas Fizz's success cases typically involve him being enabled by his sidelaners or jungler and then playing through his own lane or setting up his own plays afterwards. \n\nOkay, now what does that have to do with waveclear? Well, if Galio is less frequent/reliable/powerful (not sure how to properly phrase it - Galio generally can do less per game time) at initiating plays himself and has less options than Fizz to make an impact on the game, how is he compensated for that? One way is ranged waveclear.\n\nAnother way to frame it is, \"what does Fizz look like with ranged waveclear?\" He starts to be a lot more like Zed or Diana - more difficult to deny early on, more reliable, and as such the power in the rest of the kit (most likely E and/or R) has to be drained to support this new ability Fizz has. Part of why Fizz is allowed to have an untargetability that's also a double dash on a basic ability (one of the most powerful basic abilities in the game) is because he doesn't have ranged waveclear and generally falls behind in early lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-25T02:18:38.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What changed that made / allowed you guys to post so much more in the patch chat 7.20 compared to the other previous patch chats?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-10-25T04:41:22.103+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a combination of factors, but the main one is more playtesters are on the team now, so more people have free time to respond on Patch Chat.

I guess there has been many years since any of the servers (most notably EU West and North America) faced any real crises. I guess i'll just have to share your optimism and enjoy the new runes instead.\n\nWhile we're on gameplay perspectives - how do you think the reforging of the runes will affect the playerbase, in terms of skill level and competitive play? Some of us have highly specialized rune pages that are not possible to replicate in the new system.* \n\nDo you think a lot of mid/high rank players will fall due to the new runes? Or will we perhaps get even more players in the higher ranks due to the increased focus on personal skill/playstyles as opposed to \"generic all-rounder rune pages\" that we've had for all these years?\n\n######*example: i have a rune page with 24 armor and 8 attack damage to help me deal with heavy AD champions like Riven, Renekton and Pantheon when in an unfavourable matchup. I feel like the new runes will not allow this anymore - so if i pick, say, Camille top and get counterpicked by Riven, my early game will be extremely vulnerable with the new runes as opposed to the old ones.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-10-24T21:09:10.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is there a possibility of increasing Azir's Q AP Ratio to compensate for the missing base damage?

Inexperienced Azir players were winning almost 50% of their games, which is out of line considering how difficult he is to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2017-10-24T21:39:08.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Since ardent has been nerfed, does this mean the mage supports will be able to come back and not be a complete hindrance to their teams?  \nThese past few patches have been really really harsh on Zyra, she struggles in the midlane so she was forced botlane then she got pushed out of botlane by the enchanting supports.  Basically im a Zyra main hoping i can pick her again without feeling like im just making the game harder for my team. \n(although im super hopeful for some Zyra changes to buff up her midlane a bit without touching her supporting too much)","replies":[{"poster":"RiotMadnessHeroo","date":"2017-10-24T22:24:52.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'd expect these champions to be a lot more viable after the Ardent nerfs. Doran's Shield is still a thing though, so I'll be interested to keep an eye out for how viable bot mages are in general. Runes Reforged will surely have a large effect bot as well, and I personally think it will make the strengths and weaknesses of Support mages sharper. You will deal more damage with Arcane Comet/Scorch than you do on live, but enemies also have the ability to specialize in lane sustain more via their runes than they could previously.

In terms of total harass over the course of a lane, Comet/Scorch might do more damage. \n\nWhat matters more is that lower pen means high EHP on the ADC and support, higher EH from all sources of healing, and higher EH from shields. If the strength of a support mage is bursting the carry, how does anything on PBE improve on live?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotMadnessHeroo","date":"2017-10-27T02:31:01.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On live if you're an AD against a Brand/Zyra you would just always take flat MR blues. The net MR of their flat MR blues versus your Mpen Reds was in their favor by 4.3 MR (12.1 MR from 9x MR blues versus 7.8 Mpen from your 9x Reds). We are not touching champions MR in our base stat adjustments, so enemy AD's you face in lane will baseline have 4.3 less MR than they do currently on live. They can bridge this gap by taking Mirror Shell and most likely Second Wind paired with it, but they are giving up their entire splash and 2/6 of their pre-game rune choices to do this, whereas before AD's weren't really paying a significant penalty for running those MR Blues. \n\nSo in total your baseline harass against AD's should be more potent in lane, but if they specifically rune against your harass it will likely be a little weaker. This is at an opportunity cost for them of both an offensive splash and taking Mirror Shell over Iron Skin meaning they'll be more vulnerable to your AD's harass. Add on things like Arcane Comet and Scorch and I think there's a strong case mage supports will be stronger, although there are counteracting factors like the loss of 2% damage from the Sorcery mastery.\n\nI do think the responses to mage supports are fairly powerful though, and it will be important that we hit a spot where Second Wind/Mirror Shell + DSHield doesn't neuter these champions win condition entirely. It's also worth noting that most supports will have baseline less max HP as well due to the loss of flat HP yellows/quints, so they will be more susceptible to all-ins from Melee Supports unless splashing for Celestial Body in Inspiration, which does neuter their harass to some degree.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-10-24T22:41:48.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also do you think nerfing Ardent again was the move?

On the other hand it was completely dominating support builds, support picks and even the ADC (Going targons) and I think something drastic was appropriate.\n\nRight now, I don't feel particularly great about building Mikhail's (I miss the healing on cleanse ;_;) since it's pretty situational and unless I'm against a very high/impactful CC team I wouldn't really want to take it. I would expect this item to be more common purchase earlier, but I still think Redemption despite early nerfs would be the go-to as it has such a high teamfight/skrimish impact and at the time you finish it, it isn't all too nerfed compared to the previous version.  Athene's scales on mana regeneration, meaning that you would have to get a few mana regen items for this to unlock its fullest potential but it's pretty cheap at 2100 so I'm curious to see where this item ends up.","replies":[]}]}]}
