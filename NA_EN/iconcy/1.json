No idea. I'm just saying this because when Graves came out, one of his selling points was exactly how \"niche\" he was. A short-ranged ADC with huge burst, just a short bit of mobility and a conditional steroid. He was supposed to sacrifice DPS and safety distance for burst. And if our 2012 niche has become the 2015 jack-of-all-trades... 'tis weird, it's all I'm saying...\n\nBut if I had to think about it...\n\nHecarim - Has tankiness, a big burst of mobility, constant DPS, healing, staying power and displacing CC (Terrify)\n\nLee Sin - He can fit about every comp exactly because how good he is at everything. Depending on the balance state of the game, \"master of none\" may not mandatorily follow Lee Sin after \"jack of all trades\"\n\nElise - Again, just about everything one would need without being particularly good at anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-03-05T10:43:09.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea, that's the best way to describe him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-03-05T06:46:17.606+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally don't mind Graves, his short range usually puts him in CC range if he wants to get max damage from his Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2015-03-05T08:05:46.183+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"umm its not even half way through season 5 and you are tired of him?

You can be losing by 30 cs but land a hook/tibbers/zenith blade/whatever into jinx traps/Graves combo and you get a kill regardless of how far behind you are, esp in lower elos. Whats the point in playing Lucian/Sona and poking people 500 times to kill them, winning by 30-40 cs, only for that guy to land zenith blade out of 100 and graves/jinx kills/cc/kills you anyways? \n\nI think bot lane is more stagnant than it has been in a long time. You cant play any immobile adcs besides jinx, or you are just screwing yourself. You can win, but its going to be 500x harder than just playing graves/jinx with leona/thresh/blitz/annie/morg. Next you can play Cait and Trist for safety/pushing.

I don't know what previous seasons were like, since I'm relatively new, but in its current state, you could easily play this game for years and never realize it has 100+ champions.\n\nOf course, it would help if you didn't get punished/ostracized for selecting off-broadway champions. Try finding a game in team builder while playing Urgot or Azir or any of the multitude of \"less than\" champions, and it's pretty easy to see why people just keep selecting Jinx and Darius.","replies":[{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-03-05T12:35:48.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Darius is not a good champion and you will stop seeing him picked after you reach the MMR where ADC's can effectively kite.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-03-05T18:04:12.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx is also really common.
