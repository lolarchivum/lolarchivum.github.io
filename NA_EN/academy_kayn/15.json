Zed and Malzahar are actually pretty similar in the way that they both need to be very conscious of how much damage their abilities deal, and how their opponent is positioning, because both of them are largely about punishing their opponents' mistakes.\n\nThe flaw in that particular Zed's logic, however, lies in his failure to understand that Malzahar's Ult is one of the few remaining abilities in the game where using it can actually completely fuck you over, and as such, is never used without reasonable forethought by anyone who plays the champion. Compare this to Zed's Ult, where he can just shadow out if he used it at the wrong time. Malzahar is mechanically far simpler than Zed, but due to his inherent risk factor, I'd say Malz is about equally difficult to play (and it only gets harder the higher you climb in rank).","replies":[{"poster":"SlushieDee","date":"2015-04-10T18:58:00.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You Q so they can't flash out of the rest of the combo, you W and E for the DoT, and then you Ult.

However, in the lower elo ranks it doesn't take much to win as a Zed. This is for a few reasons: people don't know what to do against a Zed (harass while his w is on cooldown or poke when he goes to last hit a minion), people get the mindset of \"Zed2OP\" that they get too scared to do anything against him or don't think clearly when they do try something, and lastly, they don't realize that if you save your cc for when zed would want to go to a shadow, he won't be able to take it. Also, standing in between zed and his shadow, or if he ults you, dont run away from his initial position if you feel you will still die, this will make it easier for your jungler, top, or bot to stay on him without worrying about him using ult to escape. \n\nThe reason people such as Faker and Bjergsen are so good on Zed is because they realize the mindsets others have around a zed and take advantage of it. The realize the natural instinct is to run the **** away when he ults rather than move towards the initial position if allies are near. Also, they will incorporate things such as flash, shadows, and the movement speed boost from Yommu's and Blade of the Ruined King in order to dodge all skillshots thrown at him. Watch closely, their reaction times are on point, they will last second flash a skill while placing themself near the target to do damage, and rather than attacking while BoTRK active is in use, they use that short duration of burst to move from attacks. Things like this is what allow those two to all-in and pull out barely alive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Natural Harmonia","date":"2015-04-10T01:51:23.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you talk about mechanically challenging champions you have to include Yasuo, Shaco, Lee Sin, and Azir in the list.

No. His ult requires a knockup, and if your team isn't built to help you, it's a slow skill-shot you need to charge in order to use. Also rather squishy with a full damage build, his MR does not scale with level, leaving him weak to mages.\n3. {{champion:268}}: Position position position. A smart Azir can destroy entire teams, but a dumb one is just a squishy mage throwing sand around.\n4. {{champion:121}}: He used to be \"Press Q for Elo\", now you need to be smart and isolate your targets. Otherwise, you're a really squishy bug without damage.\n5. {{champion:67}}: The stuff a good Vayne can pull it is stupid.
