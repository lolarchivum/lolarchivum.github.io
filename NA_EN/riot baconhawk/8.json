If it was a drop-down list, then we can actually put that hamburger thing on *every* page for easier access as well.\n* Think we can implement a \"Red tracker\" kind of thing?\n* No way to access \"boards profile\" and the like.

The one that's three little beige bars? Another potentially OCD thing, but I feel like it should be moved to the top left of the page.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8NrKt94.png\n\nAlternatively, instead of having all the sidebar navigation at the bottom of the page, you can have it so we can scroll left in order to see all those links. But that's not really necessary, just something to contemplate.\n\nAlso there seems to be a lot of wrong thread loading for me. I tend to sift through threads before the page is completely and 100% loaded, which is probably the reason. It seems like its fairly easy for it to pick a thread above or below the one I actually wanted to poke at. There seems to be a few little things that load just after the rest of the page to cause things to shift around just enough for me to miss the actual link for what I want to view, if that makes sense... Namely the navbar, as well as the new post notifications on threads.\n\nAnother  thing, I think the font might be a little too big for posts as well.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C3dnj8l.png\n\nThat's as zoomed out as I can get, btw. I imagine this looks fine on larger screened phones, but on mine I kinda wish I could zoom out just a little bit more. Might need to do some aspect ratio adjusting for us people who like to live in the past and use Galaxy s3's still. d=\n\nAnd I am also, unfortunately, going to have to express my annoyance with the default forced read only mobile nonsense. Its cool and great for maybe an opt in testing sort of thing, but as some one who also likes to post while on a phone it gets a little annoying to have to switch to the main site on every page. I'm sincerely hoping this was a temporary dealy and not something we need to stick through till you guys implement posting features. .__.\n\nI can do without the upvotes and such just yet(though wouldn't mind having them) but the lack of posting makes it hard to enjoy the feature to its fullest potential. \n\nI do understand that testing and receiving feedback is a necessary process for stuff like this, but I would also recommend having the option to keep the desktop page and leave the read only stuff for opting in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"blkKalameet","date":"2015-07-18T00:51:44.905+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks ok so far.

I tested this slightly on the PBE Boards, and it was so nice not to constantly be clicking on the wrong thing!\n\nSome things I'm noticing are conspicuously missing, even from a Read-Only mode:\n\n* **No threads have Rioter replies**. Or, to be more accurate, no threads *show* that a Rioter has replied. I'd suggest moving the icon to be above the # of Comments counter.\n* **No Upvotes/Downvotes**. Since it's read only, there doesn't need to be a way to interact with them yet, but it would still be nice to see them. My personal thought is that for the Boards Home have the number of up/down votes below the number of comments, and that the mobile version just won't have a way to up/down vote from the Boards Home. For comments, maybe put them after how long ago they were posted?\n\nI realize as I was looking through the mobile site that the \"# new\" is taking up that space. Out of curiosity, does anyone here look at that? I think the most functionality it has for me is reminding me I visited that thread on a different device.\n\nEdit: I've noticed one big problem. Due to not being able to vote/see votes, when I open a thread I almost always try and click the \"Switch to Desktop View\". On many threads (especially longer ones with longer load times), me taping the screen coincides with the page banner loading, shoving the content down and making me press the board name instead, yanking me away from the thread.

(Possibly there is a way, but I have not logged in to the mobile site.)\n\n2. Another thing is the amount of views a thread has received. It is not possible to actually see this fact without changing to \"Full Site\" mode, along with upvotes. Its a pain to actually change between the mobile site and full site, otherwise, it would be useless to actually have a mobile site, if the critical points of a thread is not there.\n\n3. Another thing that could be possible is an actual mobile app, I'm sure it won't be that tough to be made since you have a broad and large group of coders at Riot.
