I've had this Lux painting I made sitting in my hard drive for a while now and I figured I'd toss it up on the boards! I know Lux is far from the highest priority on the Visual Upgrade list, but I think eventually she would really benefit from a Sona/Cassiopeia tier model upgrade, at the very least.\n\nhttp://41.media.tumblr.com/6485553ea52f1e25f77ef57d028e5bba/tumblr_nj0xveWRKt1qk32lpo2_r1_1280.png\n\nClick the link if you want to see a larger size!\n\n I made some tweaks to her current design to make it a little more practical and sleek (to tie in with her espionage related activities in the lore) while still being ceremonial and pretty, and I tried to maintain an inherently Demacian theme to it! Her armor was inspired by the avian insignia on Garen's shoulder plates, as well as the Demacian crest in general.  I wanted it to be like, fashion meets function with a little bit of symbolic propaganda on the side. \n\nAlso started some rough top down concepts, as well\n\nhttp://41.media.tumblr.com/c5ae4800283e4f3d85db2e38e873fa66/tumblr_niz6lhgQAM1qk32lpo3_500.png\n\nI hope you guys like it!

Any time I see anything pop up on the forums referencing skins ideas/retcon/etc. involving her I check it out, and a solid 90% of the time, I despise them. Lux has a very defined identity right now surrounding her extended lore and visuals, and a lot of the ideas that come around depict her as an over-joyful, nonsensical air-head.\n\nThat being said, I can't stress enough how **hard** you hit the nail on the head with this piece of work. It's absolutely phenomenal.\n\nLux is an intelligent, yet sad individual. She covers up her sadness with a joyful disposition. Your work doesn't depict sadness, but it also doesn't depict her as a sexualized, privileged, outgoing fool either. Her clothes are classy, yet functional as you said. Personally, I really like what you did with her hair style as well, it's not just draped over her back, but it's still long and has that braid in it. Overall, I think it makes her look more mature.\n\nI really hope Riot doesn't scrap her [extended lore](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=53939) when they decide how they are going to update her; whether its a Poppy/Sion level (which I doubt, but given the time frame of all the other Champion updates that are currently in queue, you never know what kind of status she'll be considered when the time *does* come) or just a Viktor/Sona level. I can honestly say this is something to be remembered and referenced though. I could really appreciate a VU like this one, it captures everything visually.\n\nKudos!","replies":[{"poster":"Gonsea","date":"2016-02-14T03:08:29.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the lore, I hope they keep it too, it created dept in Lol's world.

Ah, good, I can.\n\nYou took the hammer of creativity and really slammed home the nail of perfection here. Lux is a character that I not only use, but play frequently. Her splash art has always been meh to me, and her character model is clearly older. This is distinguishable by the way it sicks out as opposed to the rest of the environment. Characters with newer models (Rek'Sai, Ekko, etc.) fit in; their models flow with the background, if that makes sense. \n\nNow I've been looking at the comments, and I'm honestly a little disappointed.
