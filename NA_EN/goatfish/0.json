Ranged champions do not receive the slow resistance. Melee champions ignore unit collision for the duration.\n\n-old courage is for surviving a big engage, grasp is for sustaining like a boss, Babel Rush is for maneuverability while inside a fight\n\nthe rest of the adamancy tree:\n\nreinforced armor (-10% critical strike damage), -4% aoe damage (mastery from 2014), legendary guardian (3 armor/mr per enemy champion that's nearby),\novergrowth, adaptive armor (4% bonus to armor or mr- whichever is lower), perseverance (gain stacking tenacity based on how many times you've been hit by crowd control within the last x seconds)\nconditioning (bonus armor/mr after 10 minutes), flat 2 damage reduction from auto attacks and melees get 1/2/3 flat reduction from all damage sources based on level), oppression (-2% damage from enemies who are crowd controlled. doubles to -4% from enemies you cc)\n\nadd some extra stuff in there and tweak some junk around an you got a whole new tree. you just need to replace phase rush and fleet footwork tho. just bring back fervor for the precision tree and think of something for battle mages to put in sorcery","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-01-19T15:54:22.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hate the ones that give you Mr or armor when healing.

Tanks everywhere taking aftershock will have better laning phases (they don't take it regardless though). Tank jglers will have better early ganks/diving, making them better suited for the current meta. I don't think the tank jglers need that, but fair enough.\n\nThe problematic part is when non-tank champions take the keystone, and just win trades because of it, just like the old aftershock.

I've been slowly wittling away my use of resolve even as a {{champion:78}} because the stats and benefits from it are fucking negligable. Conditioning is not a viable replacement for siegemaster, legendary guardian, fearless, and the armor reds and quints from the old system, and the other options in its slot are hot garbage entirely. \n\nNothing else in the tree is even worth mentioning. The slot with demooish offers no survivabiilty whatsoever in any of its options, and the final slot is  % health buff that never will be enough in a game to be worth taking, an extra 40 or so health from heals which mean nothing in fights, and a passive \"health regenerating\" rune which heals less than a single fight using  Ravenous Hunter would over the length of the entire game. \n\nMeanwhile taking sorcery + domination, I get about 100 gold more worth of stats straight out of the gate, arcane comet making trades actually possible, null orb acting as a better MR buff than anything in resolve can, transcendence letting me build full tank and actually have damage scaling,  and a final slot with two extremely good options and one niche one in the form of gathering storm for expected long games. In Domination, taste of blood improves trades and provides better sustain than the entire resolve path on its own,  and ravenous hunter makes prolonged fights actually possible. And that's without even going into the other options in the trees, all of which are better than anything resolve offers.\n\nEven among the keystone, the only one worth taking a second glance at is Aftershock because of how ridiculously overtuned it is, and it's still worse than Courage of the Colossus was in that it merely prevents some damage through extra resistances instead of potentially all damage with a straight up shield. Grasp is completely unusable with how poke, burst, and trade heavy laning top is now, even with it being stronger than its mastery version in a vacuum. \n\nThe new runes are supposed to be stronger than the old masteries, but Resolve's are just straight booty.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bootleg Gay","date":"2018-01-19T10:17:50.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't understand why Grasp of the Undying has a higher damage ratio than it's healing ratio.
