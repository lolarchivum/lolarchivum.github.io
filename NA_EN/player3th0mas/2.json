You'd never hear riot promote it as such, but it is. Can you imagine their next marketing campaign? XD \"DW its just a game. You don't have to be good. Just have fun.\"\n\nAsk any pro player in a pro game (maybe even some important promos) who'd they rather have; a friendly/bad player or a toxic/good player.\n\nTo elaborate a friendly/bad playing im saying you're pretty much 4v6. Like the player is feeding their entire team, building the worst build ever on their champion, and basically drunk. I can mute or ignore people too verbal in chat.

There are following types of players in a particular game:\n\n* Feeding Type (feeds the lane/ bad day, but a team player, winning is priority)\n* Toxic Type (toxic carry type also a team player(meaning he will group if required for winning but will still be flaming randomly on the side), winning is the priority)\n* Feeding + Egoistic Type (feeds the lane, not a team player, winning might not be the priority since he is not ahead)\n* Toxic + Egoistic Type (carry toxic, not a team player, winning might be the priority only through his terms)\n\nPeople are confusing bad(feeding) types with a preconception that they are non egoistic and are always team player but that is not the case. I have seen split pushing Ashe's in my games, who feed their lane 2v2, and keep on split pushing against a Zed in bot while whole team is asking them for help doing baron. Though they might not be intentionally feeding but their intention is not to win either(since in that particular game they are not the one's carrying so its a loss in their eyes)\n\nSimilarly Toxic + Egoistic types are bad for the game too, since they don't group when the team want them to or play as a team. But with them at-least rest of the team can make a decision and group towards their lane for the win, you can not do that with the feeding+egoistic type since they are already behind and they cant dictate objectives like the person who is toxic+egoistic but still carrying.\n\nSo the lesser of two evils is toxic+egoistic compared to  feeding+egoistic\n\nBtw. following is the priority from me: Toxic Type > Feeding Type > Toxic+Egoistic > Feeding + Egoistic. Having an egoistic feeder is most definitely a loss, but having a egoistic toxic payer there is still a chance to win it just is a little hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezilian","date":"2018-02-02T09:53:06.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is talking about toxic player who will bring you a win, no matter what over a lovely scrub who certainly lose your game.
