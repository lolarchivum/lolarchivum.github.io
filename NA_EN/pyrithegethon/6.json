Sometimes having that mage with high control and burst damage is more valuable than a more standard pick, if the enemy doesn't have an answer to it. If durability is a concern, bruiser built mages are still very effective damage wise and survivability.\n\n3. The only thing safer than Morgana is something with a bunch of dash/blink mobility. Karma isn't quite as safe as Morg, but her speed, shield, root/heal, and slow can get her out of most bad spots.\n\n4. All three of those specific mages I listed can top/mid/sup, so are reasonable flex picks to throw the enemy off, so long as your team is willing to be flexible as well. So I kinda like them for when I'm first pick and heavily risking a counter pick.\n\nAll in all, its the same reason people were taking Lulu top/mid for the longest time.
