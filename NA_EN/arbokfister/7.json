Even Riot thinks so, which is why German players are on EUW servers. It's new to me that Germans and Austrians dominate anything but their respective countries.\nAfter WW2 Germans were actually expulsed from the entire East - you can read up on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_%281944%E2%80%9350%29).\n\nI don't know where your German friends are coming from, but at my school you had to take English as first or second additional language and you had to keep it until you were finished with school. It's possible that your friends are much older than I am, and lived for example before the Fall of the Wall in East - Germany. They would not have learned any English there and I guess it would be similar for Russians who grew up/lived during the height of the Cold War.\nAnyways. Modern Education in Germany \"forces\" you to learn English very soon, no matter what school you're visiting.\n\nI don't know anything about French and Spanish education, but I can tell you that there is a well-known prejudice among european players, that French people generally refuse to communicate in any language other than their own.\n\nBut let's be honest. These days you simply have to understand English to do anything at all. Only a fraction of the whole media - movies, books, you name it - is ever translated (and half of those translations are atrocious). To play League of Legends you have to speak English, because even when talking in German we still call this {{item:3153}}  Blade of the ruined King, and not _Klinge des ruinierten Königs_.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pinker 10","date":"2015-08-27T01:17:27.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">NA is one country \n\nWell shit\nSomeone failed geography... and social studies.....\nPossibly even english, what with the massive difference between **countries** and **continents**","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2015-08-27T05:12:28.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pinker 10,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B1wK9bFc,comment-id=000000020000000200000002,timestamp=2015-08-27T01:17:27.992+0000)\n>\n> Well shit\n> Someone failed geography... and social studies.....\n> Possibly even english, what with the massive difference between **countries** and **continents**\n\nYou guys know he meant the USA and not the actual region as a whole.\nQuit looking for a reason to be stupid.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Def Not A Kaiju","date":"2015-08-26T21:43:52.616+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a fellow Illinoisan, my ping went from 75-100 to 12-18.\n\nChicago server op.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-08-26T22:42:39.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when Phreak complained about his 7 ping...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2015-08-26T23:57:32.603+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmm, most of the complaint threads are dudes with 120+ ping, which is as high as east coast had.
