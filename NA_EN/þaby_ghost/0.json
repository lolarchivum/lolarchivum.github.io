I for one would like to see Kassadin (and lucian and Varus for that matter) more as a villian to the SG's...In a way Varus already has that in the Dark Star skin line...If these are in the same universe that is...\nIf you look at Varus, Kassadin and Lucian, they are much more gritty and \"Oh my life is so hard, Angst, Angst, Angst\" which doesn't really fit in with the SG theme. Same goes in a sense for Brand...although he doesn't really fit the bill mostly because he's practically walking magma/fire...\n\nBraum would fit the role of mentor to the SG's just as much as Taric would...Because he, like Taric, has a more loving and optimistic character. And then I'm not talking about putting him (or Taric) in panties and a tutu, but more a heroic wardrobe and aura. this would also go very well with something like Aurelion Sol. Altough not very loving of life per say, he is optimistic and has a lovable character (I find him hilarious at least) and he isn't evil.\n\nGnar would make for an awesome animal sidekick kind of deal :D Just like Fizz btw...\n\nAll in all, I truly think you are missing the point here...We want SG Taric because it fits his character..He's a guardian, an advocate of life and beauty everywhere (not to mention that he literally gets his power from the stars!!!). How does this NOT sound like a star guardian? We don't want him to be a SG because we want him to be gay or associate him with being gay...Same goes for Ezreal, for Soraka, for Lulu, for Miss Fortune, for Braum, for Gnar, for Jayce, for Vi, for Cassiopea, for Ekko, for Karma....I mean too much SG's would be very MEH...but I find these just as fitting as Ezreal tbh...\n\nBesides, Taric NEEDS a new skin...And as Taric main I'd love it to be an ultimate skin...this would offer the perfect opportunity for such a skin ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"StainedViolett","date":"2017-09-01T00:28:08.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not a star guardian urgot.\n\nnuf sed ...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2017-09-01T21:33:51.003+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even better when in his current lore Taric is basically a \"Star Guardian\".
