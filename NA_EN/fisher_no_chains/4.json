Now, in 7.22, Syndra has even more bugs than before and a lot of them are GAMEBREAKING and seem to happen way too often.\r\n\r\n1. **Stutter step bug:** after ulting, Syndra&#039;s model desyncs and she starts moving in a laggy way. This could cost you a death and it&#039;s extremely annoying for people who play with fixed camera. \r\nThis bug has been out for TWELVE patches despite being already fixed in the past (it&#039;s not the first time this bug appears).\r\n2. **Ghost spheres bug:** sometimes, Syndra&#039;s spheres become untargetable for her W and E; this happens almost exclusively after the bug number 1, the stutter step bug.  Basically, after Syndra uses her ultimate, the spheres thrown with her ult and/or created after casting her ultimate start moving randomly around Syndra and can&#039;t be controlled with her other spells. \r\nThis could fuck a whole fight up. Let&#039;s pretend that you want to R someone and then E to have an AoE stun, well it could happen that NOT A SINGLE SPHERE gets knocked back because they&#039;re bugged. You lose a fight, and you could potentially lose a game too.\r\n3. **W recasting bug:** our last &quot;big bug&quot; that happens kinda often after 7.22. After casting W on a minion, it gets released behind Syndra and her W goes on cooldown instantly. \r\nThis is MASSIVE in laning phase because your W becomes unrealiable and could lose you a trade. Happens multiple times during a single game and my last game with Syndra was a W bug shitfest.\r\n\r\n[Here you have a list of some bugs with proof/videos by Overlord Forte.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/2Eu7e5LL-gameplay-syndra-sphere-breaking-and-model-stuttering-bugs-since-710)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I understand that some bugs are hard to fix and take time and effort, but right now picking Syndra puts you at a disadvantage because a lot of things in her kit are bugged and unreliable. Despite all those bug reports, nothing has been done and Riot seems to avoid talking about it.\r\n\r\nPlease, fix at least some of those bugs. I&#039;m tired of having games where sometimes my QE just doesn&#039;t work and fucks my kill up.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-11-19T21:50:34.446+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what she gets for sharing a splash art with King of Clubs Mordekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-11-20T00:33:22.560+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh no is it contagious?","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-11-20T01:38:39.673+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip shaco and ezreal","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-11-20T01:56:37.686+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget TF.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-11-20T05:21:45.158+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT'S ALREADY BEGUN","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-11-20T21:55:28.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco has a few bugs like dying mid ult\n\nEzreal recently had a q bug and he’s already a mosquito for how goddamn annoying he is\n\nTwisted Fate has a weird animation cancel where he stutter steps during his q.
