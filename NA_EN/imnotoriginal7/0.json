I concur.\n\nJumping in to agree 100%. When i was first starting out in League, i would play literally everything as a support because i sucked at farming. One of the things that's fun about playing characters like Annie/Zyra/Lux as supports is BECAUSE they are designed to be mid laners. Sure they aren't as good at supporty stuff as people like Nami, but they do damage and they're like a soft-ish 'kill lane' compared to other standard bot compositions. \n\nZyra has the potential to be a super cool zone control mage much the same way champs like Azir and Orianna work. In fact, you might even say that with her plant minions, Zyra was basically doing the Azir thing long before Azir was. Please retain and support this aspect of who she is - it would suck to see her turned into a utility focused support character and lose her awesome sustained damage profile.","replies":[{"poster":"Lïghtkeeper","date":"2015-08-19T14:49:45.993+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't we all take a moment to realize that support Vel'kox is also more highly picked than mid lane Vel'koz because of his immobility.

I think her passive is decent the way it stands now, but I'm sure something more interesting could be done with it. \n*  More plants! Allow her W to spread its roots after it's been planted for X amount of time and sprout an additional bud randomly within a limited range. Would make her w more interesting instead of just a means to an end and would also give zyra more plants\n* I really would like her to be able to set up a \"base\" of sorts.

In theory, her kit should allow her to fill the role rather nicely, mostly counterganking and farming up for the mid-late game damages, while providing good utility for her team, at the cost of mobility and survivability.

The other AP junglers are mostly assassins like nidalee and diana.\n\nWhile in theory her kit SHOULD allow for good jungling, particularly with the free \"wards\" her W provides, her early clear is just too horrible to get away with unless the enemy jungler is woefully incompetent. Would it be too much to ask for her to get something of a \"nidalee treatment\", with specific interactions with jungle camps to help her early clear (first clear and the ones before getting Runeglaive)?\n\nAlso on the subject of Runeglaive, it REALLY is suboptimal for true mage junglers (hence why no one plays fiddlesticks anymore).
