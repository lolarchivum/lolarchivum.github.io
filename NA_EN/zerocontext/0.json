{"poster":"zerocontext","date":"2017-10-27T22:55:59.681+0000","title":"League Client Strike Team: An Update!","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all -- wanted to give you another update on the League Client Strike Team.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve been busy over the past couple of months working on behind-the-scenes performance improvements (to client startup and core game loop, and in reductions to overall memory footprint) as well as more obvious changes (such as [new filtering and sorting options in Champ Select](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/client/client-features/champ-select-upgrades-incoming), and UI changes to the main nav for some regions using Asian character sets.)  We&rsquo;ve also squashed a bunch of bugs impacting large numbers of players.\r\n\r\nBased on the data that players have shared with us, we&rsquo;re seeing gradual improvements (on average) for players across all regions in the time it takes to load into the client, get through map/mode selection and Champ Select screens, and our overall bug report count. Feedback (which we gather from our surveys) has been trending positively, so that&rsquo;s a decent indicator that we&rsquo;re still focusing on the right things.\r\n\r\nOf course, our work is not yet finished.  For starters, if you&rsquo;re still having issues, we can definitely use your help -- filling out a bug report, ideally sharing [your logs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq12) as well, would be a tremendous aid (for logs, just throwing them on your public file host of choice and sending us the link in your report is probably the easiest way to share them). Filling out a bug report helps us understand the scale and severity of problems; getting the logs saves time and provides clues in helping us better identify what&rsquo;s actually going wrong.\r\n\r\nOne of our other big pushes is going to be around improving performance for players connecting to our platform under challenging network conditions.  Sometimes this situation can cause issues in the League Client -- usually in login, game lobbies and Champ Select -- without impacting in-game performance, due (in part) to how our network is structured.  Thanks to your help (specifically, your bug reports and logs!) we now have a sense of the scale and severity of these issues, which helps us prioritize them.\r\n\r\n**Finally, I wanted to clarify that we are definitely exploring removing the option to toggle off the client while in-game, but haven&rsquo;t committed to a patch in which this will happen.** Our hope is to get the client optimized sufficiently to run in the background without causing FPS drops, which would allow us to keep it on all the time without impacting your play. When we toggle it off and bring it back after each game, it can slow down your post-game experience by having to re-load all postgame content, like Honor and end-of-game chat (as well as potentially enable some other things that I can&rsquo;t talk about yet).  \r\n\r\nBut we don&rsquo;t want to rush this.  So we&rsquo;re going to be validating that we&rsquo;re able to successfully keep the client alive without impacting in-game FPS before we make the change, which we&rsquo;ll communicate out ahead of time.  And of course, we&rsquo;ll be relying on you to let us know if we don&rsquo;t have things working quite right.\r\n\r\nOK, this was another word wall from me.  I get feedback about my writing style constantly and really wanted to change it up this time.  You can see how well that turned out.  Someone suggested I show some visual information to break it up, but tbh all I have to offer are a bunch of charts, or maybe a picture of one of our engineers&rsquo; desks with like, coffee cups and random pieces of paper on it.  Neither sound especially compelling to me but, uh, lmk if that&rsquo;s your kind of thing. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as always, reach out with questions/comments/etc. and please keep the logs and bug reports coming!","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-27T23:08:55.718+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think this is the proper place to ask, but it is client related, just probably not part of the strike team.\n\n* Would it be possible to poke some folks and see if they can implement a self mute feature in game?

Not just a simple bar that will show when you'll level up but it'll act as an indicator to show if people are going to get punished soon. My ideas are as follows:\n * When you level up honor, you start at 50% of the bar, hit 100% you level up, hit 0% you get punished by the behavior system.\n * No actual level numbers, but a % bar only. Maybe only updated after 5-10 games so no secret sauce gets leaked. \n * A notification pops up at around 20% of the bar, saying that their behavior is starting to become unacceptable and they need to watch their actions.\n * If people fake nice, at least they are faking nice instead of flaming.\n  - If people back off from being toxic (and just mute and not chat all game) cos they are trying to not get punished, at least we have a bunch of games with less flame.\n * obviously needs a tooltip to show how/why the progress bar moves forwards or backwards.","replies":[{"poster":"zerocontext","date":"2017-10-28T00:31:42.682+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"This probably wouldn't be changes that our team would take on, but do fall within scope for the team that owns these underlying features.

Having full friends list and going through manually ~250 offline persons to make room a new active player is a chore.\n* The items section seem to load all sets when entering the section thus making remarkable lag. Loading the sets itself after loading the list of sets would reduce loading time.\n* While in champion selection a way to filter out champions that have their chest acquired already or even a indicator witch one has the chest would be nice.\n* Seeing enemy place a ward and leaving it visible after that would make the game even to everyone. We already know that there is a ward, keeping track how long it is going to be there is the tricky part. Using third party program to keep track of them just places us to the era when dragon timers were 3rd party. If that seems too easy to keep track of them, maybe have a mini game there like that someone from your team needs to ping the 'enemy has vision' on the ward before it turns invisible to keep track of it. Do note that I mean visible, not targetable. So no 'free sweepers for everyone!', just a way to keep track on the wards.\n* Option to display the health in numbers middle of the health bar would be nice.\n* There is no way of knowing how much strength a shield has left. If the HPs would be shown in the bar then it could be show in style of something like [ 102+755 ].\n* Pinging an ability sends status of Q, W, E, R when more accurate would be using the ability names. They are given nice names after all and kinda helps those that don't play with default keys. \n* Pinging items with effect like Spoils of War does not tell how many seconds left until it is charged.\n* Death cap is usually lacking lot of the info if the combat has been ceased for couple seconds, yet assists are given while showing no damage would been received from that player and I am not talking about assisting Zed that shields or heals.\n* Damage us usually shown in big clear numbers but heals seem to have dark pack with RNG when they are shown, especially in replays. If an ability or item was used to produce a effect, that result (numbers) should be always shown.\n* If recalling and numerous other things are interrupted when taking damage, being shielded should prevent that as you are not taking damage. Or change the wording 'in combat'.\n\nCouple improvements/issues that kinda fall in the client section.\n\n* The 'total healing/shielding/ect done' values shown in the items while ingame would be nice to see also post game and in match history. Now if i want to see if e.g. Athene could replace the nerfed Ardent in healing boosting You need to manually go trough game replays to get the values.\n* Following the above logic some more data about game extremities/stats would be nice. The 'highest critical' only serves two players in a typical game, the two ADC's. Instead if there would be 'highest damage instance' then it would server 8/10 players. If it would be 'peak performance' it would cower all players in the team as then the best healing/shield could be show there too. I have done some 800HP heals with Soraka without Spirit visage but there is no record of those glory moments.\n* Chat rooms. Yes yes, they were removed because of spam but ingame chat rooms is the best place to find company for playing. Maybe let only same level people see each others or rooms to be divided to under 30 and 30+. And frankly when we used national chat rooms, there was no spam nor problems. The clubs feature does not hit the spot as those people are already friends with those people. IF the clubs would allow unlimited number of people, then they could be used for get-to-gether/gather but even then that newbie should be somehow introduced to that club. Having national channels and maybe even making people auto join them based on IP would make life much easier for grouping up and making new friends, especially when trying to build teams for any kind of eSports.\n* Summoner icons are quite unpersonal and their point is kinda lost by me. Times like now when worlds events are running, everyone in my friends list look almost the same. Hundreds of same icons. If the summoner icon would be build from the icons that a player has collected along the years, then it would be almost unique, like a mosaic. Or when hovering mouse over the summoners icon it would show a hoover where that one selected summoner icon would be surrounded with the eight or 24 most rarest icons he has (one layer around the central icon or two layers).\n\nSome game issues that might belong to another dev thread but I didn't find a suitable one. Consistency and Clarity were some of the big words used couple years back but still there are things like:\n\n* Blighted Quiver does not proc spell vamp and Soul furnace is not getting stacks from Zz. Either it is a long forgotten bug or it should be change to true damage to be consistent with other life steal/vamp. Same way the Soul furnace should grow stronger when the creep score keeps growing.\n* Athenes Blood Charges targeting seems to be random. Using area shields/heals usually spend the charges on a target that does not really need them e.g. spend on tank that is missing as many HPs as the mid laner has HPs left. Also there could be some numbers shown as it feels like that the charges don't benefit from healing amplifiers.\n* The game is even more populated with 'from bonus this and that' making it really hard to predict the final impact on item sets. Seems like it would be more convenient to bind the different bonus to 'champion level*n' and then fraction added from total stat for the final number. That way those building for high stat would benefit for getting the items as would those that aim high on that one stat.\n* Some shields decay, others don't and rate of decay differs. It would be nice that all the shields would have some one second delay in decay or no decay at all or just be consistent. e.g. shielding people from final spark with Locket has lost nice deal of its shield before the actual damage comes. One second delay paired with the decay rate in portion of how frequently the shield can be cast would be nice correlation. Short cooldown in shield, fast decay. Long cooldown, slow decay. Something like Aria of Perseverance having the games shortest rotation of shields with 3,3 seconds would keep its (undamaged) shield strength for the first grace second after it would lose 50% its value in the next half second tick and losing the rest 50% its strength at the next half second tick for total of 1,5 seconds of shielding like it is presently. Same time Stand United has 200 second cooldown so having 60 times longer cooldown granting it something along  only 5% decay per half second tick making it have only half its undamaged shield power left at its current 5 second lasting time. Such decay rate would make it last for almost double the time with 11 seconds but then again it would only have 50% of its shield capacity left at the last half second. Again, if not damaged at all before that half second mark. Decay rate could adjust to the effect creations CD dynamically, at least that's how I would do it and like to see it.\n\nThanks for the awesome 'play again' button feature that gets the same people with same positions. That small thing alone should get you guys a weeks pay. Thank you also for the item sets, they are loved.

If possible though, could I request a change in the shop that I would find (and many others I assume) useful: When purchasing skins the client currently does not show the full splash. Instead it shows a very small icon of the skin's splash instead of the full art. and when you click on more info, it first takes you to the champ info page, which you then have to find the skin you were looking at initially. \nSo could you either make it so that when we click on a skin to purchase, the client displays the entire splash? An easier and still acceptable solution might be that when we click on the more info it takes us directly to the skin's splash from champion info, instead of having to scroll through all the skins.","replies":[]}]}
