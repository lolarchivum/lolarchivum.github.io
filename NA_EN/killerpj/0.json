There was a dev discussion earlier explaining how free movement on demand was bad and movement in certain scenarios is desired, like Yasou's minion dash etc. \n\nCurrently Ahri's Q move speed is a \"fire and forget\" whenever free massive move speed on top of being a great damage/heal. Other champions like Viktor has to have a minion at hand (and spend gold) to boost their move speed.\n\nMy suggestion would be to only add a move speed buff if a target is hit, a small move speed buff for single target and more move speed for multiple targets hit. This would lower her dueling potential a bit when her ult is of cool down (or have to hit the minion wave as well as the lane opponent) while still giving her a reward of move speed for good aim in team fights.\n\nFizz needs to have his E telegraphed better, it's a great movement and invulnerability spell as well as a very high damage spell. The problem is that with his ability to change direction mid air it is almost impossible to avoid the damage. The landing area should be highlighted as soon as it's chosen by the Fizz player (or something like 0,5sec before landing), making it easier to predict and dodge as well as saving potential cc for the landing area.\n\nOther things could potentially be added to this as well for Fizz if he's still oppressive, such as a higher cool down on his E if it doesn't hit a champion (similar to how Gragas belly dash was handled) making it less attractive to use for wave clear and jumping walls, but still rewarding good use in team fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Kuon l","date":"2015-08-08T22:41:38.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LA9NFId7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-08T05:16:50.905+0000)\n>\n> We're putting a bit of power back into Zed and Le Blanc in 5.16, in both cases partial reversions of the previous nerfs, they got hit harder than intended.\n> \n> 5.16 also includes an overall nerf to Ahri's passive (same healing at level 1 and level 16, less healing at the levels in between though).\n> \n> Fizz we're still talking about.

This passive is almost never a issue when another champion tries  1v1 Ahri, and  most poke champs have low mana poke abilities  and will burn through her mana and thus push her out of lane and she wont be able to heal her self too.\n\nOn the Fizz situation I think that Fizz mobility puts him in a dangerous spot because his e is one of his main damage abilities and if he uses it a well organized team or player can out play the FIzz and punish him for his mistakes. With the nerf to his q ability being able to not hit if a enemy dashes away this hurt him plenty and I dont think Fizz should be changed in the current state that he is right now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-08T21:44:43.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you please increase the CD on Fizz's Playful Trickster.

Which is why i personally use flask, because of the original healing nerfs.\n\nWhich means her healing at levels [1/6/11/16] which is [3/8/13/18] is being changed to\nEssence Theft (Passive) healing changed to [3/5/9/18 at level 1/6/11/16] from [2 + (1x Level)]\n\nSo i did some further calculations on her loss of healing if she were to hit 6 enemies(Basically a minion wave).\n\nJust hitting 6 minions for sustain with orb, since she can't W-Q for that spell vamp sustain anymore is adjusted to the following,\n\n* levels [1/6/11/16] - [18/30/54/108] compared to her current healing of\n* levels [1/6/11/16] - [18/48/78/108] Which also means she misses out on 120 passive healing lvl 18.\n\n\nThis is not including the 9% AP scaling healing ratio.\n\nIf the 9% scaling ap ratio is taken away, \n(I'm doing calculations from a build i tend to run on {{champion:103}} with {{item:3165}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3285}}  \nat lvl 16 setting)\njust with AP from runes and items not including masteries, but including the rabbadans boost. 380 Ap(items) + 25 AP(scaling blues) which is boosted to about ~546 AP at lvl 16.\nWhich is essentially a ~49 healing bonus at lvl 16.

He's only strong if you know what you're doing and he only really face rolls in low elo.  If you know how to play fizz and play around him, he's really not a problem.  The problem is that people don't understand you can't just do the same shit over and over again and expect to win.  Low elo people have a tendency to do the exact same combos at the exact same time, which make them really easy to dodge with fizz.  If I'm playing against a lux and she blows her entire spell rotation off right when I q to her every time, then of course I'm gonna e then and all her damage is void.  Instead of realizing this though, most people will just do the same thing and then cry that fizz is OP instead of looking what they did wrong and thinking about their actions.  If you just wait till he blows his e and use your spells then, then he is fucked.  People never acknowledge that maybe their opponents have skill, its always that the other champ is OP.\n\nAhri is in a fairly balanced state as well, she's a mid range mage that trades high damage for mobility.  Sure she has three dashes with her ult and movement speed with her q but look at other mid range mages.  For example look at the raw damage from viktor, he absolutely deletes people and the damage on his beam is sickening.   Ahri has nothing like that, she has trouble 100-0 anyone even in the late game.  Unless you're really fed, you can hit a full combo and not even kill an adc without ignite and an ult charge or two.
