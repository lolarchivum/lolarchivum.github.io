Shit, there are plenty of patches in each season which do this. It's part of the game.\n\nWhat the preseason never changes, nor the patches, is smart play. Knowing jungler routes, level / item power spikes, macro play, rotations, baits, ect ect ect.\n\nThe biggest skill which ALL players lack UPTO the pro scene is macro and game sense. You can translate that kind of understanding into oppressive CS leads, superior objective control, or running an unholy rape train on incompetent laners as a jungler. This preseason did NOT change that, and trying to blame your failures on the preseason is an excuse.\n\nYou just need to buckle down, find a champion which can capitalize on low-skill players (there are a lot; darius is a personal favorite of mine in lower elos), and develop your macro play & game sense.\n\nI say this as someone who has climbed out of silver four times, and the only times I didn't make it to plat were the seasons I played less than 30 ranked games.
