It has become a terrible experience as a season 1 player to continue to receive this toxic behavior from players. I appreciate the steps Riot has and is taking to punish players conduct, but lets be real. We know we need to implement something new, or should I say, something more strict. Now with this statement I know a lot of negative thoughts can develop. Riot is a large company and need to make money, and if we punish players too severely they wont come back. Riot would lose revenue. \r\n\r\nI have a solution. This is where I believe you need to rethink your system for league of legends Honor and Competitive play. My recommendation is to create what I call the &quot;Honorable Queue&quot; in which players who choose to enter are held to a higher standard then current League of Legends. This would be a strictly positive atmosphere only. People who choose to play in the Honor Queue would be volunteering themselves to be held to a higher standard. Players who do not volunteer to join the Queue are not forced to be held to a standard that is not agreed upon with all of the community. Negative behaviors would be punished with bans from the Honorable Queue. You could really lay into strong punishment while still allowing players to play your game even after receiving bans from the Honorable Queue. This system can be enforced by player reports in the Honorable Queue. \r\n\r\nAs a player, I&#039;m tired of not being able to relax and play a calm friendly game of League without get flamed or worse all game. It&#039;s really is OLD. The Tribunal really was a great system back in the day, but I understand the issues it developed and why Riot removed it. Riot&#039;s current system really is not working any better in my opinion. I do feel like I have the first hand game time experience to state this claim. The solution is found by not punishing toxic players, but by rewarding the players who promote a positive environment with a Queue they won&#039;t have to worry about toxic behaviors in. As a player, I don&#039;t want to be rewarded with merchandise. I want my time playing the game to be the reward. I play this game to have fun, and playing a friendly game is a rare treat.\r\n\r\nThis is a big project. To give an idea towards making it possible (lets say a possible first step) would be to make this honorable Queue what ranked is today. All Riot would need to do is up the enforcement for toxic behavior to stronger bans from the Ranked play. I know for a fact that this would be a positive influence for the community who is there to enjoy a competitive friendly game of League of Legends. \r\n\r\nI hope you did not take my conversation as a bash towards Riot as a company in any way. I am just a passionate player who desires to see an environment full of positive players willing to work together and have fun.

The worst flaw I can quickly see is that a change like that would increase queue times. If the split was 50/50 between \"Regular\" and \"Honorable\" queues, the queue times would double (I believe that in some queues that would cause some serious waiting - for me it would only mean about a minute of extra queue time so \"no problem\" for me, but double ten or twenty minutes and that will be too much). It would be even worse if the split between \"Honorable Queue\" and \"Regular Queue\" was for example 10/90 in either way, one queue would have 10 times longer queue times than he has \"now\", while the other would not be in practice affected. Would you stay in the 10 times longer queue or would you move to the other queue to get to the match sooner? I know would move to the faster queue in that scenario - I won't be punished in whatever queue I am in, and I could mute &amp; report the bad guys in whatever queue I would play in. \n\nScenario 1: If the \"Honorable Queue\" was the faster one, that would potentially kill the \"Regular Queue\" and people's accounts who .. misbehave. That in turn would mean that your voluntary \"Honorable Queue\" in practice just turn \"Regular Queue\" to a Prisoner Island in reality. \n\nScenario 2: If the \"Regular Queue\" was faster, the Honorable Queue players would have to wait longer for their match and thus the Honorable Ones would be punished with their much longer queue times. Fair eh? \n\nSorry to say, but I find it quite unlikely this idea would work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyCauseBad","date":"2019-01-07T13:14:43.316+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why dont you make a que that puts you in your honour level?\n\nHonour lvl 0 que - Mostly toxic people, standard is low etc\nHonour lvl 1 que - Some toxic, standard is normal\nHonour lvl 2 que - Mostly friendly normal individuals, standard is normal\nHonour lvl 3 que -  All friendly individuals, standard medium\nHonour lvl 4/5 - Friendly individuals who encourage people, Very high standard","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2019-01-07T20:45:56.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Honour lvl 4/5 - Friendly individuals who encourage people, Very high standard \n\n\nhaha. nice joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-01-11T07:37:08.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, ill probably would be stuck in the Honour lvl 0 Queue forever.

But from my experience between how Normal and Ranked Queues are currently, I see no difference in player behavior. I believe that the honorable queue might have longer queue times and be less tempting to a large group of players unless it really becomes a positive environment for players. If that happens, queue times might drop and player behavior would be better for the most part. League would remain the same it was before in terms of standards in other queues.

I guess we have a misunderstanding. From my point of view, the current standards of League created the environment we have today. I honestly feel that creating a voluntary place for players to play in will not change the game into prisoner Island. Technically it could already be \"Prisoner Island\" in my point of view, just without the \"Island\" part. The players looking to adapt to a positive environment will \"leave\" the standard queue to an extent, but the punishments for toxic players in general still holds. It is not going to become more toxic because you might have fewer players who are pushing for a positive gaming experience in standardized queues. I suppose it could be looked at as having higher odds of toxic players, but that does not necessarily mean they will be toxic. Despite how the current reporting system may feel, it does work, just not to the standard most players would hope for. I also don't believe all toxic players want to be toxic. This change might bring about a positive experience for toxic player reform. It will give players something to strive for if they do want to change. Why put the toxicity into the entire community. The whole idea about creating a positive gaming experience is to minimize the toxicity. It really will come down to how the \"toxic\" players to define how they will behave in this \"Prisoner Island\" and if they choose to misbehave, it is no different than receiving the current league of legends punishments. In the end, toxic behavior is not supported in League of Legends.\n\n(I hope this answers your question/explains my view better)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2019-01-07T06:00:50.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bans and reports would still have the same merit as they do now.

Maybe stop promoting this snowflake mentality and don't give players tools to punish their own team mates. \n\nThere is nothing honorable about being lazy borderline troll and getting triggered, calling people toxic when you are inevitably being called out for it.\nLeague of Legends is a bit like living in Soviet Russia, nobody really works but if you don't like someone you can report them. Not a good environment for a competitive game and it actually promotes lunatic behavior and doesn't help the serious players in any way shape or form.\n\nPlaying well should be the only thing that matters. Period.\nThere already is a system for that, it's called ranked.\n\nWhat happened to \"toxic players lose more games\"? If that would be the case, why do we need an extra system that rewards and punishes behavior that is not even gameplay related? Is losing games not punishing enough? Or is this actually just a lie and toxicity doesn't even correlate with performance? How is toxicity defined anyway? I guess it's rather subjective, the other day I asked somebody to get an important item and immediately he started writing in all chat calling me toxic and asking for reports. That's just a prime example of how the fight against toxicity backfires in really ugly ways.\n\nAnd now this thread basically suggests to turn a competitive game into an interactive group therapy, where everyone is so obsessed with quantifying how people behave, that they simply forget the basics of the game.\n\nThat's honestly the last thing this game needs. \n\nAlso if you are genuinely trying to play well and work with your team, you literally don't have the time to come up with insult or worry about how people behave and who deserves a report. The report calling and excessive flaming usually starts when people have given up anyway.\nWhen you are focused on the game any offensive comment is just a sidenote.\n\nMost likely being offensive doesn't make you lose, but people tend to get offensive when they already lost.\nSo maybe stop acting like this \"toxicity\" is the source of all problems. You didn't lose because your team mates where toxic, your team mates just started flaming because everyone was playing like shit.

First of all, what do i get from it? If it's just a normal queue but stricter, then there is no benefit for me.\n\nSecondly, for some players, it would be stressful. Lemma ask you this, what exactly do you mean by 'higher standards'? If I say 'this is an easy game' would that be punishable? Or would I be required to compliment my teammates every couple of minutes? Personally, that shit would move my focus to sucking my teammates dicks instead to the game.\n\nImagine playing ranked and instead of making sure you dont fuck up in the lane you're checking every single thing you type/ping to make sure you dont offend your teammates. That's not the game I would like to play. This is League, not Babysitting Simulator.\n\nNow I could go to normal queue but there is a posibility that Honorable queue would just weed out 'non-toxic players' leaving only toxic ones, making normal queue even worse.\n\nSo now you have honorable queue which can put pressure on you to not say ANYTHING that might make your teammates offended, or play with toxic shits. Both are mentally draining if you're asking me.\n\nBut let's pretend to go with your idea. How do you think players would behave in that queue? Do you REALLY think every1 would be super nice to each other? Fuck no, players would keep their mouth shut and play, not rly different from normal queue.","replies":[]}]}
