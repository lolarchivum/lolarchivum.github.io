They either have to fix Dynamic Q, or create Solo Q before everyone jumps ship. \n\nThough it does sound like they arn't completely abandoning Solo Players, but rather saying they need more time. Personally, I'm patient, and can wait for riot to make an informed decision, rather than try and rush them.\n\nAnd they are probably right about people falling in love with the new Q.
