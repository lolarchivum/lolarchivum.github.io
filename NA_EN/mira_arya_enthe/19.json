We have so many beautiful realms in Runeterra we are learning about from the lore updates but only 2 primary gamestyle maps and then some side game type maps.\n\nIt would be amazing to have a vast, epic Shurima map that supports a totally different layout and larger overall map (Maybe more than 10 players).\n\nPerhaps a map in Ionia with more team based objectives and less power to individual players.\n\nMaybe a real brawling map in Piltover/Zaun with two levels where early game fighters excel.\n\nMaybe a map where ~~a Noxian and Demacian~~ a fortress is on either side with some cool siege mechanic.\n\nOh oh! a map on moving boats/airships for Piltover/Bilgewater! (My god the coding ._.)\n\nThis variety would really stir things up for a change. And some champions who aren&#039;t viable on summoner&#039;s rift might see play on them while some who are OP on summoner&#039;s rift might not see play. We need something refreshing and new in League, and no, not another busted item or another champion release with 6 passives, 7 actives and a transformation. {{champion:102}} \n\nLeague is getting a bit stale, even if matches weren&#039;t 10 minutes in when decided. I would love to see more of Runeterra and experience my favorite champions in new places, as well as many of the beasts, monsters and glorious things from the lore.\n\nEDIT: Some counterarguments\n\n**\"Queue health\"**\nIf maps were similarly designed to summoner's rift but with a different layout/visuals and slightly altered objectives. Then they could be on the same queue.\n\nIf maps were drastically different. Remove flex and blind pick, give EUNE, OCE, etc draft pick back. And then add 1-3 new maps. That is more interesting than 2 pointlessly additional versions of SR play.\n\n**\"It couldn't be balanced\"**\nSummoner's rift isn't balanced. At any point there are about 20-30 viable champions. And this is the permanent state of the game unless Riot picks one absolute tier to balance around.\n\nAt least if say Riven is OP on summoner's rift due to x wall hops and y objectives. Instead Garen might be better on a different map due to layout and objectives.\n\nAlso some map specific balancing can happen.\n\n**\"3v3s didn't work. Neither did Dominion!\"**\nBut ARAM did. The problem with 3v3s is that it is 3v3. League is balanced around 5v5(or potentially more) interactions. Just like nobody in WoW considers 2v2 Arenas balanced because of game balance.\n\nDominion \"didn't work\" because every map needs to be about laning and blowing up a nexus. This is a Moba, king of the hill may be a fun Rotating Game Mode but not a primary playstyle.\n\nNew maps should play like SR but with new layouts, visuals and objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2017-01-30T22:00:11.541+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"I want champ reworks.

Sure, the size of the player pool is unrelated to the proportions of roles (unless all top laners love Bilgewater or whatever), but that's not the only factor at play. \n\nThe goal of matchmaking is to assemble a group of ten players with comparable MMRs from the pool in the quickest time possible. As the options available to the system decrease (tighter MMR bounds, more role selection, fewer players in the pool), queue times go up. If you loosen them, queue times go down.\n\nQueue times in Diamond, for example, are much much longer than in Silver. The ratio of roles requested presumably remains more or less the same, but because the pool of people in Diamond is so much smaller than the one in Silver, queue times are longer and sometimes matchmaking is looser.\n\nIntroducing a bunch of new queues more or less turns League from Silver to Diamond; the pool of people looking for any one thing gets smaller, so the system struggles harder to match people in a timely manner. I'm not trying to say that new maps (maybe as rotating game modes?) aren't a good idea, but that they would take some serious thought on queue health.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The MechE","date":"2017-01-31T02:10:02.306+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Heroes of The Storm had a good idea with the multiple maps thing, but the problem is how would you balance that for LoL?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-01-30T20:34:08.460+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"well i would take Magma Chamber to actually get an official 1v1 Map/Mode (it wouldn't even have to be 100% balanced and not even need Ranked, but i think it still would be a good and fun addition to the game) over the next shit like {{champion:164}} anytime.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-30T20:36:37.200+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too into 1v1 maps, as I see too much cheese potential in anything with less than 4 players.
