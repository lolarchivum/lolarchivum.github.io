Upon going and clearing all camps that are marked, Lu'Kath's next basic attack against champions will be empowered, dealing bonus damage equal to 30% of his AD, plus 30% of his AP, plus the square root of his total health and mana. Upon successfully landing the empowered basic attack on an enemy, all of Lu'Kath's cooldowns are reduced by 10%.\n\nAdditionally, if this empowered basic attack kills the target champion, any allies that received gold for assisting on that kill will grant Lu'Kath bonus Armor and MR equal to 5% of their respective resistances. Also, for every champion that assisted with the previously mentioned kill, a satellite will be launched into orbit around runeterra. Periodically throughout the game (5 minutes, reduced by CDR), these satellites will locate places where various item components can be found scattered across summoner's rift. By going to these locations, which will be marked on the minimap, you can collect these components. These components can be sold or kept, as normal. If Lu'Kath's inventory is full, he will instead be granted XP.\n\nIf Lu'Kath levels up from the XP gained from picking up an item uncovered by the satellite which was launched when your allies scored an assist on the kill you got with your empowered basic attack, then he gains a stack. At 5 stacks, Lu'Kath's basic abilities will passively grant him stacks of Mist. Upon reaching three stacks of Mist, the stacks reset to 0, and Lu'Kath gains 0.5 seconds of invisibility. For every unit killed before the invisibility timer runs out, Lu'Kath gains a stack of Independence. At 50 stacks (scaling with the number of states in the USA), the stacks of Independence will automatically jump to 1,776. At 1,776 stacks of Independence, Lu'Kath gains **_Freedom Fighter_**\n\n**_Freedom Fighter_**: 5 seconds after being spotted by an enemy champion, any enemy champion within 1000 units of Lu'Kath are forced to stop and salute at the American Flag, which will be flown over Summoner's Rift by 5 jet planes. During this time, they cannot move or cast abilities, and their vision is locked to whichever direction they are facing, but the visuals are slightly blurred, as they are looking at the American Flag, and therefore can only see parts of Summoner's Rift out of their peripheral vision.\n\nThe American Flag has a chance of falling to Summoner's Rift and covering it completely, based on Lu'Kath's critical strike chance. If this event occurs, the minions of the side allied to Lu'Kath will be turned into American Marines. American Marines are champions, but coded with special AI equivalent to Mordekaiser's Dragon Ghost, and therefore will not obey any of your commands, because they don't take shit from anyone. Despite being champions, however, they are coded as minions, and will grant gold for the Bandit mastery, any of the Gold Generation items, and from Azir Ult.\n\nIf a Marine kills an enemy champion, that champion gains a stack of Freedom. At three stacks, the US military invades their respective homelands, freeing the people from the Commies. Upon the time that freedom is delivered, that champion's cooldowns will only go down by spamming emotes. However, if the emote spam isn't entertaining in any way, that ability corresponding to that emote will not have its cooldown refunded, and that champion will be forced to go without that ability for the rest of the game.\n\n_Upon killing the enemy nexus (because Freedom is inescapable), an American flag drops out of the sky to land the final blow on the Nexus, granting 50 gold. to America Additionally, instead of \"Victory,\" \"Freedom\" will be the end-game screen, and a screenshot will automatically be taken and made your desktop background. 'Cause 'Murica._\n\nEdit: Day 53. Still no one has noticed that this ability has nothing to do with the cosmos or any kind of eruption.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-04-03T03:03:53.603+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"This was the best thing I have read in ages, this comment is...

New maps are unlikely.\n2. Reworks and class updates are independent from new champion releases.\n3. Client features are also independent and Riot will start working on them once the new client is stable on every PC.\n\n>It is either going to be an attempt to be excessively unique and/or be busted as fuck on release(or with post release buffs), then will drop off the face of the earth and nobody will give a fuck about it.\n\n_**Jhin says hi four times, trying to catch your attention.**_\nAnd i don't quite get the argument. If a new champion disappears from queues after their release, then they don't matter but once they do and are being played, it's because they're OP/overloaded? That's not fair. That is equally true for every champion you normally never see and they suddenly Ryze to the top.\n\nAnd it isn't true that Aurelion Sol is underplayed. [His lolalytics page](http://lolalytics.com/champion/AurelionSol/) says he has a sample size of 19219 games in Plat + in the last 7 days. Compared to him, [Urgot](http://lolalytics.com/champion/Urgot/) has a sample size of 7294 games. Even [Aatrox](http://lolalytics.com/champion/Aatrox/) has 14747 games, [Karthus](http://lolalytics.com/champion/Karthus/) 21797 and then there's this [Yasuo](http://lolalytics.com/champion/Yasuo/) of 199415 games... Shit.\n\n>Plus Riot no longer ever just releases 'generic' champions.\n\nYea, they did. _**Taliyah.**_\nIs there anything complicated about her kit? She has a typical burst mage pattern with a huge utility Trump ult. She's more similar to Lissandra. But you shouldn't expect that every new champion release is now going to be a \"generic\" archetype. There needs to be some diversity.\n\n>I say this because I saw the new teaser image but instead of going \"CANNOT WAIT to see what the new champion is!\" I got flashbacks to bullshit like Ivern.\n\n\nWhat's wrong about Ivern exactly?\nHe doesn't appeal to you? How can you base an entire argument around your own preference? The Ivern player might now enjoy playing with or against champions of your preference so who's right in this case?\n\n>And the last time I felt excited about a new champion was two years ago.\n>Maybe I am just alone in this.\n\nI'm split 50/50 between new champ releases and reworks.\nMy two favorite champions (Morgy and Evie) are waiting their turn at the rework table. Morgana's in the middle with a stable winrate and just OK to play with or against. But there's really no expression of mastery than just \"i can predict my Q toss really well\".\nEve sells herself as an Assassin but plays like a Diver. I don't like her tanky builds at all and her squishy but bursty builds are not viable in long games. Actually, both her squishy and tanky builds are useless in long games.\n\n\nThe reason why i anticipate reworks more than i do new champion releases is because i am familiar with the \"original\" League roster and i am quite attached to them, even if i don't play all champions. Seeing them re-imagined in a new light and given a new purpose is more exciting than seeing a new addition to League trying to wow me. The thing is, in order for a new champion to wow me, it has to meet MY criteria. I just love to play mages and that doesn't mean i like every mage. I like them glass-cannon types.\n\nTaliyah on release, didn't at all appeal to me. It took me some time to accept her as a champion and find my own uses for her. Today, i was thinking of buying her. Didn't like Kindred before, bought them a week ago. They are fun to play with. I HAVE HATED ANNIE WITH A PASSION FOR ALL THESE YEARS and just yesterday (when i was grinding April Fool's bots + Slumber Party event) was ecstatic how fun she actually was as a full AP support. \nThe new Galio's a beast.

It's the realization that a problem exists and the action & decision of continue keeping it as a problem\n\nInaction is a type of action.  A crime by omission is equivalent to a crime by acting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2017-04-03T03:15:02.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah you're not totally alone, lots of people feel this way. While I like some aspects of Ivern in particular, I hate all these \"more than human\" Champions. Ivern is an ancient tree guy, Aurelion is a space dragon, Kled is in every Noxian war in history for some reason (makes me worry what the heck they are doing to Yordles...)\n\nThese days, I barely have time for League so I stick to my core champions when I get the chance to play. I get more excited about lore implications and expansions relating to new Champions. Camille was cool for me because of her role in Piltovian society and her possible connection to other Champions. Back in the day I called the release of both Sejuani and Lissandra based on the lore alone (ah, I miss you JoJ). That was a really cool feeling to read about this important character in history and then get to play them. We need more of these alluded to Champions, like Irelia's brother or Kassadin's daughter or Kog's daddy. \n\nThat said, this is also the reason I find reworks more exciting. A fresh take on an old favorite, with lore expansion to boot.

If you read all this new Demacian lore, seems like every story they introduce a new scary creature. So Yordles can't be a nice creature race? Having different races is pretty common in fantasy stories, I don't know why Riot is against the only fantasy race they even have being an actual people and not randomly appearing spirits or whatever.\n\nMakes Gnar's backstory make less sense. Why would there be neanderthal Yordles? How did they evolve if they're this immortal race?","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-04-03T10:14:26.440+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordles","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
