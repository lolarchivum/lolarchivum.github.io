But, you have to keep him CC'd for so damn long, that his team will likely have taken Baron by the time you can actually kill him. Oh, and if you make one mistake in the CC chain, or he just happens to have a brain big enough to buy a QSS, he just spins away, laughing at the fact that he wasted your time.\r\n\r\nPeople say to shut him down early, which is very easy to do. I've done it several times myself. The problem is you have to actively keep working to make sure he stays behind. Meaning, if you do that, you don't get to play with the rest of your team. You get ahead, push your advantage somewhere else, and......oh wait, there he is, already having put your tower to half or taken it completely.\r\n\r\nAnd then if he happens to get ahead....you just lose! Because no one on your team has the capability to go toe to toe with him. Your team can focus him down and kill him, but by the time you're finally able to, you would have taken so much damage that the rest of his team can just clean you up.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Tryndamere is so......painfully.....aggravating on the fact that he demands resources to be constantly pushed towards him to make sure he doesn't take over the game. And, if at any point those resources are used somewhere else, he just sits, farms, and split pushes to the point to where he just can't be stopped.\r\n\r\nI know he is somewhat high on Riot's VGU list, and I cannot wait until that day comes.

Their kits have more self agency instead of outside agency, which means that even in bad matchups you aren't knocked out of lane the moment the game begins.\n\nWe have kits that do too much, {{champion:268}} and {{champion:429}} , for example. In the right setting and hands, they fill multiple roles at once without really sacrificing anything for it, so they were put down in the dumpster to prevent them from being too popular (at least for those unwilling to put the time and effort into the kit to play it at the same level as other champions.)\n\nAmong the list of worst designs... Including tryndamere, which you already mentioned, I'll go with these:\n\n{{champion:53}} . His kit has far from aged well, and although it still works and can still be a fun champion to play, it's all over the place. We have a passive that scales on current mana (making it either worthless or really, really powerful), a pull, a stat stick steroid, an AA reset, and AOE damage ult with a micro-silence. Combine the kit together and either the enemy has to run up to you, or you have to land your Q, rendering the entire kit dependent on a single ability. I would say that's really badly designed.\n\n{{champion:41}} . The good ol' money making barrel king. I find him bad design because essentially the optimal play is to drop barrels out of reach then throw out new ones and just go for nuking. His entire kit essentially feels like 2 abilities late game; his Q and E, and just a bunch of AD items to amp this up. His ult is for stragglers and maybe to start a fight, but you could live without it late game, and early game you toss it in for assists essentially, which lead to it getting nerfed repeatedly. His passive is often only good in the earliest of duels, because most enemies who get in that close would likely kill gangplank if he tried a head on fight, and enemies that don't kill you up close would likely die anyway without it if you could stick. All together, it feels like you're basically just relying on blowing up barrels in people's faces by magically making one appear next to them, instead of ambushes, patience, or confidence (the ability to face an enemy that can murder you if you slip up, but you just don't care because you know you wouldn't mess up).\nInstead, barrel wizard.\n\n{{champion:236}} Hello, there, Lucian! Your E is the main candidate for this. Your kit is that of a spellslinger, where you want to mix in your pistol shots with your fancy gimmicks of gunplay, but in reality you pretty much only need your E late game. Any champion that can only jump on you once does not have much, if any, chance to kill you without it being a one shot gimmick, otherwise you have to essentially invalidate his entire existence by holding him in place for a few seconds with stuns, pulls, knockups, roots, etc, and that's not fun for either player to have to be in that position.\nThe main problem is the only real weakness he has is \"just cc him\", otherwise it's just stat checking. Enemies with more range beat him because lucian never reaches them; enemies that outdamage lucian (draven, for example? I'm not even too sure on this) just brute force their way through, but everyone else has to deal with this man who slips through your fingers constantly, loading you with bullet after bullet. His kit still needs to be learned, but most of his \"good\" gameplay comes through knowledge of his E, which leads me to say that he isn't too great on the design aspect.\n\nBasically, if a champion only relies on a single part or two of their kit, they're bad design to me. Tryndamere mostly relies on his ultimate and the rest of his kit is there, but not nearly as important, so he falls under that too. For champions like zoe, the W is situational use rather than \"use whenever\" and her E and R both set up her Q, meaning using all of her kit helps a lot more than it doesn't. Same with Akali and Zed; thorough knowledge of the kit means you know how to use everything, and ignoring parts of the kit isn't something you can just do.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-12-21T01:30:22.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:41}} : ...\n\nbring back our jolly roger!

Oh Hades i&#x27;m starting to sound like [Hashinshin.](https://youtu.be/XYVncXYx4fY?t=96)\n\nStep off bro. Just back off. Leave this one alone. She has more weaknesses than more than half the roster. She actually requires you to think if you want to do anything with her effectively. She is not a 9 IQ champ like Tryndamere, Yasuo and Yi where you just right click with one hand and jack off with the other and still get a dozen pentas.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-12-20T19:48:34.567+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relevant username i see. \n\nI don't know why you're defending only Fiora from this thread when her design isn't for sure THE best design here.\n\nAlso Fiora can be 9 IQ champ when you'll get ahead, trust me, i played some Fiora recently and im low IQ player.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-12-21T15:04:28.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:21}} , her Boobs too small\n\nrito fix plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-12-21T13:14:06.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know... I saw this thread and immediately thought Trynd.  He's not OP.  He's not impossible to deal with.  He's not broken.  He's just really, REALLY poorly designed.  He does ONE thing, and that's splitpush.  No nuance.  No skill to speak of.  Not much to him beyond right clicking and stat checks.  Just an old, outdated champ that needs to go away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-12-21T12:05:17.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad in terms of lacking {{champion:102}} \n\nBad in terms of being so overloaded {{champion:268}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2018-12-21T11:48:29.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:77}} by far. He's not a champion, he's a minion with 4 (actually 3) different banners of command. You buff him, then he attacks the enemy.\nAnd the fact that he's the only champion in the game that actually has only 3 abilities (because people usually don't level up R) speaks volumes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draught of Souls","date":"2018-12-21T03:58:53.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor design?\n\n{{champion:427}}","replies":[]}]}
