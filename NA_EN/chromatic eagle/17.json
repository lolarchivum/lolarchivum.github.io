(I miss Burning Tides, myself, too.)\n\nBurning Tides was **special**:  It was the first set of significant new lore since the Freljord Patch of 2013 and the big RetCon in 2014 (which is another issue entirely), the start of the bromance between Graves and Twisted Fate, Gangplank's \"rework\" and MF's change from \"shameless flirt\" to \"hardcore b----,\" a fleshed out Bilgewater (which still lacks a real map) the Black Market Brawlers ARAM mode, etc.\n\nNot every release that includes new lore can be that extensive and epic, which makes it a bit disappointing.  Then again, not everything at Riot can syncopate that well every time (or ever again, lol).\n\n> When you say you&#x27;d rather content was updated unconnected to special events, do you mean more like it&#x27;s a random Tuesday, and unconnected to anything else, a story drops?  \n\nI wish the cadence for these story releases wasn't wholly tied into new incoming content or some special event.\n\nFor example:\n\n* The first Shurima update was for Azir and the second was for Taliyah.\n* \"Burning Tides\" was built around the second Gangplank rework.\n* \"Mt. Targon\" was made around the Taric rework and Aurelion Sol's release.\n* The most recent updates to the Shadow Isles happened around Yorick's rework.\n* This Piltover event was fabricated on the release of Camille.\n\nAs I said earlier, I fully expect a huge lore update for Zaun when Warwick's rework is finished and for Demacia when Galio is ready.  That's really annoying, especially when we were told by Narrative that new content wouldn't be tied to new content.\n\n> When Universe went live and we found a few more champ stories (like the sad Ekko one) was that more what you were after?\n\nNo.  Once again, the release of that new content required a tie-in event (Universe going live) and led to another softball-filled Reddit AMA (and not on these boards) that didn't attempt to answer any of the tough questions that has plagued this Narrative team since the Freljord patch (which had a different Narrative Lead) and the RetCon (which had another Narrative Lead).\n\nIt would be nice if new stories could be released when they're ready and not require a tie-in to some upcoming release and if the Rioters in Narrative would unclench their hindquarters and have _meaningful_ communication with their fans on THESE boards and not on Reddit..\n\nHope this elaboration helps, but I really doubt if anyone within Narrative and Foundations will actually **want **to do anything to address them.  :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-09T22:10:07.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had Camille questions but I forgot.\n\nWhich parts of Camille are still human, like say, limbs or organs?\n\nAre her hips and thighs natural or metal?\n\nAre there homeless people in Piltover?

However, there's a healthy amount of interaction between the two, especially at the areas where they are closest.  The deeper into Zaun you get, the stranger it would be to see a Piltie, though.\n\n> ...How is constructing an artificial heart more difficult than a brain, and does Orianna predate Camille?\n\nHearts occupy a special position in Runeterra - it's a more poetic or symbolic take in a way.  I know that doesn't make much sense to us, but you can think of the brain as the source of decisions, the heart is the power source.  Really important power source.\n\n> ...How close is Zaun to Piltover? Apparently people can run or walk from one city to the other in a few minutes or hours.\n\nVery close, but they're both pretty big cities.  So there are places on the outer edges of both cities that would take many hours to get to the other side, but at their closest points, they're pretty much overlapping.\n\n> ...Besides Camille&#x27;s family, are there other notable clans that we&#x27;ll see?\n\nWell, we've heard of the Medarda clan (mentioned in the Progress Day story, and Jago Medarda is the owner of the Medarda Heirloom map).\n\n> Why hasn&#x27;t Noxus invaded Piltover like it has Ionia and maybe Demacia? Do Noxians still have ties to Zaun?\n\nWell, Noxus is a bit like Batman in that respect.  Batman always has a plan for how to take down everyone - even his closest friends.  Especially his closest friends.  Just because Batman hasn't taken you down, doesn't mean he's not given it a lot of thought.  (Also, mountains, Piltover's pretty fierce navy, risk/reward considerations, and wars on multiple fronts.)","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-16T14:48:25.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many wars is Noxus waging? \n\nSo hearts in Runeterra is like Bleach (source of power and such)?\n\nI thought that Camille was Medarda?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-12-16T15:59:39.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=GhktKEe7,comment-id=0001000300000001,timestamp=2016-12-16T14:48:25.639+0000)\n>\n> How many wars is Noxus waging? \n> \n> So hearts in Runeterra is like Bleach (source of power and such)?\n> \n> I thought that Camille was Medarda?\n\nNo, Camilee is Ferros.
