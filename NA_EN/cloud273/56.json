Why would you call a champion AP if they have 0 AP? By this definition Shyvana (as one example) is more of an AP champion than an AD champion. A lot of her damage comes from her magic damage because her W is AOE magic damage, her E is magic damage and the %hp is dealt as magic damage, and her ultimate applies magic damage. I personally like playing Shyvana as an AP champion, but there is no doubt that it is more common for her to be built with AD or simply as a tank. \n\nUltimately though, you are correct about it being irrelevant because what we call something is really not important other than the way we communicate with each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-13T02:48:22.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elite4Runner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jPEVQAkJ,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-13T02:31:11.895+0000)\n>\n> By this definition Shyvana (as one example) is more of an AP champion than an AD champion.\n\nBecause Shyvana IS an AP champion.

Shyvana is more commonly played as an AD champion. Yes, she has MORE abilities that deal magic damage, but by purchasing AD items and a little attack speed, she is able to deal more physical damage. While her W does scale on AD, it does not scale well, so despite increasing her damage output, it really doesn't increase it by much. However, debuffing someone with E and then combining that an AD heavy Q will ultimately lead to a heavier physical damage along with a %hp magic enhancement. Plus, relying more heavily on attack speed means that she is more likely to be built in combination with crit chance, .. both of which need a decent amount of AD in order to be effective.\n\nUltimately, this is a challenging champion to place because she can really fit into just about any role with some degree of success.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-13T08:02:03.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elite4Runner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jPEVQAkJ,comment-id=000800000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-13T06:25:44.080+0000)\n>\n> I really need to disagree with you.

I wonder this sort of thing a lot as well, not specifically with Zed(I've never played the champ one time just FYI) but with most champs that seem to have multiple abilities with poor AP scaling.  You can see this with some of the Devourer Junglers to be even more specific (shyvana). I see her built either tank or with AS/AD/Lifesteal.  I'm pretty sure she has at least 2 abilities that scale with ap, but you don't typically see her built with a rylai's. \n\nHowever you have confused abilities/spells with the type of damage they deal. SO lets just clear that part up. All champs have abilities, but what defines a champion as AD or AP is the respective AP/AD ratios on the champs most important abilities. This also needs to account for passives. There are only a few champs that have kits with either  ALL AD or AP ratios on all of their abilities. SO you wouldn't consider ZED to be an AP champion based on his use of abilities, rather HE would be considered AP if required AP items to do AP damage. SO AP zed would have a build based on AP items. \n\nWhat separates him from AP Midlaners( I.E viktor) is item build . According to his wikia he has no AP ratios whatsoever. SO he would actually yield very little damage from building AP items.  Now he could use some of the stats an AP item would give and have it be useful, but his abilities wouldn't necessarily do much more damage from hitting an enemy. Unless its something that has on hit effects/AA effects. For example Pretty sure Rylai's would still slow, and maybe Liandry's would do damage over time(never tested so try it out and see). However, his abilities would still be doing base damage even with 400 ap since he has no ratios that use AP. Works the exact same way in reverse, however your basic attacks will obviously grow in strength (AD zil or something like that)\n\nLet's look in depth more here  for fun. I'll use a champ i know well for my example, Rengar. AP Rengar changes his play style rather dramatically. Rengar uses his abilities in quick succession, and then if need be, likes to reset before reloading the combo again (Sorry if you knew this). Most people would consider him \"AD\"and  his kit has mostly ad ratios (Q,E) , but his W has a very stout ap ratio(70%). So you stack a few items, and get ahead in the game, and you're a jumping kitty with a very deadly roar.  However since the rest of his kit is focused around doing AD, u can be in a bad spot if you miss that ability, or screw up the combo for the max burst. So its easier to deal more consistent damage building AD Rengar vs AP Rengar since you only have one source of AP to deal AP damage with. He's still technically an AD champ despite my enjoyment.{{champion:107}} \n\nI find it strange and intriguing that champs have ap and ad ratios. Especially on new champs like JHIN, who has great ap and ad ratios. So it comes down to a couple things - Personal Preference (play your way, tho your way may not be efficient/easy) - And of course LOL Math - What items will make your champ and its abilities do the most damage and/or have the most utility or a combination of both. Many players use the mathematically correct builds to determine what  damage type a champ is, But there's nothing wrong with having fun right?!?!\n\nI hope SOMEONE READS THIS(LOL) and found this useful!
