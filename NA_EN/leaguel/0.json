THANKS ROIT!!!!\n\nThis is going to be a bit long so be prepared, so apparently my account got permanently suspended for &quot;sharing another player&#039;s personal information&quot; which I have never done.  My account got banned on a day where there was a login issue which I did not experience but I was normally playing and after a game finished my client crashed and was trying to log back in and a message pop up saying my account got permanently suspended and check associated email for more detail and I got nothing in my email or any notice anywhere.  I have never got any warning or bans at all.  My account is a closed beta account, so I have been playing since then, which contains rare skin like black alistar, king rammus, etc, and also accumulated over 90k IP because I was trying to save up to a 100k as a goal of my own.  And then this happened.  Here are all my tickets I have sent to roit support.

We take situations like this very seriously, so we reviewed the evidence and decided to ban this scumbag off the face of the Eart--League.  We don't want miscreants like that apart of our community.  So far so good!  Yet, when we entered the players name in our account tools to ban them, we typed the name wrong.  Not like we fat-fingered it, but sometimes lower case letters and upper case letters can look very similar to the naked eye, and we took the upper case \"I\" (i) as a lower case, \"l\" (L).  This was the first suck:  For some reason, we didn't copy pasta the name.  \n\nWhen you wrote into us *LeagueL*, our agents read your ticket, looked up your account, saw the ban notice, and took the time to double-check the original ruling.  We take suspensions and punishments very seriously, so when it is challenged we fact check everything, and perform another investigation.  Since the evidence is really damning, we made the same call that the ban was justified.  However, none of the follow-up agents checked to make sure that the Summoner Name in the original report matched your Summoner Name.  [This is where we sucked again](http://i.imgur.com/9ReRvb8.png). (I legit tried for 20 minutes finding a damn .gif of this without success).  \n\nKeyru will respond to your ticket (#23351506) to talk to you more about this issue on a one-on-one setting and see what we can do to make this right.  Without question, we are going to un-ban your account and make sure the right player has the full wrath of justice fall on their head.\n\n-------------------------\n\nAs for the support agents who took part of this entire experience, we are going to do some internal investigation and take appropriate action.\n\nA side note regarding some of the other commentary in this thread:  Depending on the reason for the suspension, we don't always share the specific or exact details, especially when it pertains to sensitive/personal information.  This is why this information was never directly disclosed in the ticket, as we try to protect the original party. If this evidence was specifically disclosed, it could cause retaliation. This case is a perfect example of why we have this policy.   More specifically, if we identified where the evidence exactly came from, the next logical question is, \"can I see the proof?\", of which the answer is going to be \"no\".  Not a very happy end which is why we don't give details of the evidence.\n\nFor this case, it all boils down to us messing up on the Summoner Name, nothing to do with the evidence itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Iesbian","date":"2016-09-19T19:03:24.790+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could this issue be solved in the future by using a font that better differentiates I and l?

At this point, it is a 'he said, she said' matter and Riot will almost always win these cases because they don't have to disclose this information to anyone. \n\nAll you can do is make as much noise as possible and hope someone who is sympathetic hears you. Truth be told, we can't be sure you aren't lying your ass off. There just isn't any evidence.","replies":[{"poster":"LeagueL","date":"2016-09-18T05:05:47.639+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I am lying I wouldn't bother wasting time on this or the support as I am guilty but as for what I know of myself, I have not done that thus I just wanted details of it or just type of info will help too which none of those were given other than keep spamming me with nothing they can do about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Resolution","date":"2016-09-18T05:06:31.746+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's beyond terrible exposure to them, to say the least.

Bans you with no proof but lets Mark share accounts and \"fine himself\". What a joke. Riot throws older players aside to try and focus on dragging in more \"friend groups\".
