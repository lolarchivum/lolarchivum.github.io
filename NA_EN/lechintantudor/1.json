Orianna also has her ball for vision into bushes not needing to face check. Cassiopeia has more unreliable defensive tools, but that is because she has really strong damage if she lands any poison. Cassiopeaia's has her movement speed on her q if she lands it (not too hard to predict as the jungler will be moving towards you). Her w area of effect ground + slow against targets farther away, and her ult. Again her kit has unreliable tools by design due to nature of having damage per second burst in magic damage.  The comparison to the ADC version of this would be kog'maw who's only tool is a area of effect slow to prevent ganks ( and later his r to provide vision to check bushes), but again gains more damage due to even less defensive tools.  On average basis mages with their kits have more peel tools then most adcs. For the more utility comparison is ashe who's kit only has a weak slow and her ult(single target stun but aoe slow) but again has vision tool to help prevent ganks.  A fair comparsion to similar utility would be lissandra which she has a mobility tool/ aoe slow/aoe snare/ and a targeted stun/ zhonyas on her ult to get out of a gank. Again way more defensive tools to survive then adc comparison. This is besides the fact that the primary issue that comes with mages as a class is their utility+ burst+ long range is what creates the primary reason why assassins aren't played as much. Why, play a class with higher risk, but another class has similar reward to an assassin, but takes way less risk from 500+ range on the shortest range mages on top of utility if the person falls behind. That person will still have some value to a team.

ADC&#x27;s just dont wake up one morning, play a game of league and decide they are going to buy those 3 crit items at 10mins. They have to wait til this thing called the &quot;Late game&quot; to get going. Assuming they are sufficiently ahead in farm. Even then they have to go through 2 other phases, the early game, ({{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:76}} ) and not die to these fellows. Then again they have to not die in lane and avoid the mid game ({{champion:99}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:268}}) to get to where they are supposed to be, strong dps champions built for your mid to late popping off. \n> \n> This is not the case for all adcs, just most.

Talon takes 2 seconds to do 2700 damage with his Q/W/AA burst combo, but that damage only full registers after an additional 2 seconds for the bleed damage to fully proc. Talon will have nothing left at that point but slow and relatively weak auto attacks, whereas Jinx still gets to keep doing 1850 damage per second until the teamfight is over. If you were to factor in that Talon continues to auto attack the target during the 2 seconds bleed period, he'll do even less damage overall than Jinx. \n\nJinx also will probably have ample lifesteal, meaning that it's entirely possible (and I've had this happen to me) for the Jinx to survive your burst purely off the lifesteal she's getting during the 2 seconds it takes for your combo to execute and the 2 seconds it takes for your bleed to fully proc. You'll die and she'll be back to full health soon like nothing happened.\n\nEven if talon uses the second half of his R damage after gapclosing with stealth, he'll only do about 3000 damage in about 1 second (actually, the damage will be significantly less because the 3000 damage figure requires an additional 2 seconds for the bleed damage to fully proc). This number just assumes that if you only have enough time to get 1 seconds of burst off before being peeled, that's how much damage you'll at least get off, assuming the target doesn't heal or shield in the meantime.\n\nSo this is an extremely marginal window of usefulness. Only in this very specific circumstance can you do something Jinx can't. You can do more damage in one second than she can, but only if you use your ultimate, and it often won't be enough to kill a lifestealing ADC in a teamfighting context anyway. So you end up asking yourself, why bother going through all the hassle of playing Talon if that's the only thing I gain? Yeah I can roam around, but that doesn't do me any good once the teamfighting phase of the game starts and I am unlikely to kill anyone important worth sacrificing myself for. Do I really want to do more damage in one second that I'm willing to risk not getting the kill at all due to all the shields, heals, lifesteal, statis effects, CC, etc ? I may as well just play a secondary ADC, secure my kills, and be a lot more useful to the entire team with sustained assassin level damage. \n\nConclusion: A typical itemized ADC will assassinate better than the purest assassin champion in the game.\n\nReason 1: Delayed burst on an assassin was a stupid idea from the start. That's why Leblanc got reverted. You cease to have an assassin be an assassin when you put in delayed burst. Talon was still one of the most bursty of the reworked assassins, but after they toned down his numbers and nerfed lethality the delays he does have become dealbreakers. \n\nReason 2: ADCs get their items too fast. Laning phase ends 10 minutes earlier than it use to. That window of usefulness where roaming assassins had a chance to influence the map is small and means very little towards influencing the outcome of the game in most elos. That's why mages and assassins all have taken a backseat, and toplane just becomes a farming lane for teamfighting tanks. And midlane just becomes a farming lane for teamfight mages. With some roaming thrown in aimed at getting bot lane fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-04-28T03:58:12.306+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Laning phase ends 10 minutes earlier than it use to.

I am not saying talon is some crazy hard champ or anything but he does have various combos he has to pull off and quickly, where as jinx you literally fucking right click.","replies":[{"poster":"Midlane Kayra","date":"2018-04-28T08:49:44.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, dont forget you've to switch your Q if you want to deal AoE damage.

Often there are shields or CC that can get you close enough to slam the ADC, my problem is that if you do not one shot an marksman right now they are back to full life in seconds.

If I survived I would probably be lower health and back or risk being picked off easy.   If the ADC survived they were in teh same situation.\n\nNOW:  A mage still gets knocked out pretty fast, but now so are tanks.  Now I still get half a chance to land a good combo, but half the time their 1 or 2 initial shots get them back enough life the survive my burst, if the combo is perfect you might off them.  If you somehow miraculously survive, you are still in that same position of backing or being an easy target.  If the ADC survives they just shoot a minion or two, are back up to full and can continue team fighting or pushing.  ADCs pretty much never have to back unless they are buying items.\n\nThe safety nets are too big for ADCs.
