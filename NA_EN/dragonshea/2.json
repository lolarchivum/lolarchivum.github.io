I think that she and the Du Couteau bloodline possess great longevity as they are the descent from mages turned assassins, living up to twice that of a normal person so one of the reasons I listed her age as 36 was because of Cassiopeia's Maturity and personality would imply she is youngish and that because she is the youngest of her sisters and it's implied the she was one or three more sisters besides Kat, which would make the age gap more reasonable. And on the subject of Du Couteau Longevity, I would be that Marcus is 72 years old.\n\nEdit: BIG mistake on my part, there really are only two Du Couteau sisters. Which would really make Kat 31 at most. \n","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-09-19T23:36:46.569+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was confirmed that Jinx is actually the same age or slightly older than Vi.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2015-09-20T12:49:32.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Superb Villain,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=toIVtdJA,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-09-19T23:36:46.569+0000)\n>\n> It was confirmed that Jinx is actually the same age or slightly older than Vi.\n\nWhere is does it say that?
