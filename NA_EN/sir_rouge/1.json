I don't stand on top of, or on the other side of her Q's, when she has spheres on the ground, I back off.  I buy MR, she has to roam (which she is god damn terrible at), and I focus the FUCK out of her in teamfights.  She isn't scary unless she's stupidly fed.  People just hopped on the Syndra hate bandwagon when the MYMU unleashed (heh heh) her potential. \n\nI will agree that, if she were to get any changes/reverts, her Q should go back to 6 seconds, that way, she is back to \"normal\".  The whole idea of Syndra as a WHOLE CHAMPION, (lore and gameplay), is that she grows in power as time goes on.  When Riot made her, they completely hit the mark with her kit showcasing that.  She needs constant micromanaging, is one of the most position-reliant champions in the game, and she cannot just 1 shot without prepping her ultimate first (if at all).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Recon1212","date":"2018-04-09T02:14:00.153+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"bruh if yas had Zeds winrate the boards wouldn't have a single post not saying nerf yas","replies":[{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2018-04-09T13:17:32.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Also where the fuck is this dude getting these win rates?

Ever since that damn MYMU Syndra has been getting hammered with negativity because of her \"point and click ultimate\".  Mind you, she has always HAD that ultimate, but it only became a problem because she had access to the full potential of her ultimate.  The \"counterplay\" is not her ultimate, but her spheres on the ground.  PAY ATTENTION to them.  WAAAY to often do I see enemies stand on top of a Q I have on the ground, or they just blindly walk up to me.  She is stupidly easy to gank, just play around her E and the spheres she has on the ground.  Also, buy a Negatron cloak and merc treads.

This over run meme of - I just got one shot by a Syndra that missed everything - isn&#x27;t real and is an experience that we want to change for those in constant denial. \n> \n> For those who doesn&#x27;t know, Syndra&#x27;s current Q passive lets her spheres survive for an extra few seconds allowing for easy 7 ball ults if maxed at lvl 9. This is what we want to change as it lowered her skill floor ands ceiling for not reason. It creates a painful experience for those playing against her and forced the mains to be endless told they play a point and click brain dead champ. Even though fun fact, Syndra has had that ult since she first came out. The old Syndra would need to build max CDR and had an extremely reduced amount of time to land the ult once she got the 7th ball down.\n> \n> However in the MYMU they shifted power away from her kit an put it all into her ult (and still never fixed her mana issues). Making her overall lane performance weaker just so you can feel good about landing a bigger ult. Any champ the can dodge her ult R or stay out of range from it is now an Insta losing lane because the rest of her cant pick up. Hence why we just want a reduced ult, for a better overall kit.\n> \n> For those that don&#x27;t want Syndra to ever get played I have some tips\n> \n> Build a Negatron, Merc boots or barrier/ nullifying orb, if ad just get a hextrinker (itemisation helps)\n> \n> Her roams are trash due to her movement speed and mana problems are plenty\n> \n> Syndra may be squishy as hell but shes also a BURST MAGE, if your an ADC trying to 1v9 the world make sure you have a shield support handy before you do so. And don&#x27;t just stand and auto.\n> \n> Syndra&#x27;s E is her life, if that is down she has no way to defending herself other then straight up damage. Her Q and W have windup/ travel time animations so don&#x27;t walk in straight line\n> \n> Look at the Q&#x27;s on the ground, DON&#x27;T GO NEAR THEM, (think orianna ball but with more limitation). Don&#x27;t parallel or create a space with the ball between you and her, you will just going to get stunned.\n> \n> And last, her ult is single targeting, its not annie ult, and its not one shotting you like a Veigar ult\n\nI already tried to explain this to them.  Apparently no one should have to itemize against her or keep up the spheres she has around because she's \"always casting them\".  Because ya know, she has infinite mana at level 6.","replies":[]}]}]}
