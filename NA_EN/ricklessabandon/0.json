These changes are being made specifically with competitive play in mind, so we wanted to talk about them separately instead of combining them with the 4.7 forecast posted by the Live Gameplay team. As clarification for the curious, the Game Systems team doesn't work exclusively on competitive changes—we just want to highlight the instances in which we do competitive work. If this dual-post format works out, we may continue doing this in the future. Getting onto the changes themselves, the three areas detailed below will be what I'm focusing on in the 4.7 patch.\r\n\r\n**1) Trinkets**  \r\n*We've lowered the 'game start' timer of trinkets down to 30 seconds.*\r\n\r\nWhen we first introduced trinkets in the 2014 season, we gave them a 'start of game' cooldown that prevented them from being used within the first 90 seconds of the game. Since we couldn't be certain of how trinkets would be used/swapped in competitive play coming from a world that had never seen trinkets, we selected 90 seconds as a conservative timing to guard against potential/unseen abuse cases. Since their introduction, we've concluded that the initial trinket cooldowns need to go one of three directions:\r\n\r\n* Push the trinket timing further to effectively remove them from competitive openings.\r\n* Pull the trinket timing back and fully embrace their use in competitive openings.\r\n* Be content with the 90-second timing and fairly predictable trinket use case in competitive openings.\r\n\r\nIn the 4.4 patch we pushed the initial trinket timing to 120 seconds under the assumption that a healthier variety of strategic openings could exist without trinkets as a factor. What we've learned since then is that the costs associated with many openings, such as traditional 2v2 or 2v1 lanes, is relatively too high in comparison to the common \"3v1\" or \"4v0\" openings we often see today (this is influenced by the need for early vision to safely setup a non-4v0 opening, the early power sacrifice to acquire that vision when purchasing wards over gold items or combat stats, and the disadvantage incurred in lane by opting into those setups). At this point we believe that pulling the trinket timing back and allowing teams to incorporate trinkets into their openings will reduce the cost discrepancy between openings in areas where they were a bit too harsh.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**2) Towers**  \r\n*We've added Fortification to the bottom tower, lowered its duration to 7 minutes (from 8), and increased its damage reduction to 30 (from 20).*\r\n\r\nWhile we still feel that Summoner's Rift should have some asymmetry to it (specifically, differences between its top and bottom halves), we'd like to shift the focus of that asymmetry back into neutral objectives (such as Dragon) and subtle terrain differences (such as brush) and away from early-game fragility of the bottom tower, especially given the late-game importance of bottom lane's inhibitor as an objective.\r\n\r\nThe damage reduction is being increased as followup to the transition away from higher armor values on towers. Currently strategies that allocate 3-4 member of their team toward pushing down a tower within the first few minutes of the game (typically on the second or third minion wave) are effectively 'triple dipping' on advantages since they're more able to hard zone the enemy (resulting in 100% of potential minion damage being applied to the tower), expedite the tower's fall by applying significant amounts of champion damage to it, and increase the minimum allocation of champions needed to respond for their enemies (for team comps that don't meet specific requirements). While these advantages aren't intrinsically problematic (at least in isolation), we'd like to reduce the overall strength of this tactic to some degree given its costs relative to other tactics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**3) Dragon**  \r\n*We've increased the base Gold value of Dragon to 145g per player (from 125g).* [*Total value now 750g (from 650g).*]\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the context of the tower changes, we're planning to reinforce the Dragon's role as a contested resource in the earlier phases of the game by increasing its base Gold reward to be a little more attractive for the team. This will mean that Dragon will be worth more at all phases of the game. As with our other changes, we'll be keeping a close eye on this change, and will make adjustments in the future as necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Limakoko808","date":"2014-04-30T22:56:04.459+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":4,"body":"Honestly i have to say THANK YOU. \n\nNo more 4v0s, late invades?

As a spectator it's boring to watch pro players rush a turret and get it because 1 person can't defend against it. It's like if a professional athletic sport allowed each team to go against a defense with half their members for their first possession  or a certain amount of time at the beginning of a match. Sure we see points scored but it takes away the potential excitement of an early play. There's no skill involved with these kinds of plays, it's free and imo dirty gains.\n\nGo back and watch the Dignitas-Curse game of Spring Play-offs. Curse thought freezing the lane would be a good tactic with their 2v_. Well Dig just pushed like crazy and got a tower advantage. 2nd game Curse thought they could do the same tactic as Dig but go for an extra buff. Dig just pushed faster and gained another advantage. By the third game Curse had to do exactly as Dig and push hard. This strat allows teams to play around strong laning teams, to cut out a crucial step of normal games. It doesn't separate good lane players from the bad, the easiness of the tactic encourages stale early games and people who can free farm\n\nYes there should be variety, but not when it makes a major part of the game a snore fest","replies":[]},{"poster":"Craton","date":"2014-05-01T02:19:50.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is this supposed to decrease the likelihood of the 4 man push or 3 man zone/dive push?  Yes, you'll be less blind in your OWN jungle at the start, but your vision of enemy starting locations will not change much.\n\n\nGiven that bot lane is now stronger, teams have more reason to initiate a swap because they don't have an inherent disadvantage for doing so.  Further, given that tower strength has not changed the ability for the jungler to grab buff(s) and 3-man has also not changed.  In some cases this is a little more volatile of a strategy, but most commonly picked junglers (or at least sets of junglers + bot lanes) will have free leaps that will allow them easy in-and-out juggling of aggro.\n\nThe slight difference in dragon doesn't amount to much given how these situations already play out; so long as the swapping team doesn't get too greedy, they can easily rotate in time to stop a dragon attempt (it does a LOT of damage at 5-6 minutes and players do a comparatively small amount).  It's not any easier for the non-swapping team to get dragon, so the small increase in value amounts to no effective change in balancing the swap vs non-swap.\n\nIf anything, I expect these changes to result in MORE swaps.","replies":[{"poster":"Shopach","date":"2014-05-01T02:34:44.104+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing of note is that the increased value of Dragon does provide disincentive for lane-swapping, because the team that initiates lane swap sacrifices power on the dragon side of the map, which should be much more important with higher gold values.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MajikDUSTY","date":"2014-05-01T03:43:28.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things really stand out to me. The first one, as Shopach said, is the fact that dragon is worth more. Teams have to be very confident that they can out push and respond to the dragon otherwise they could be put slightly behind. It basically adds a lot more to consider (push power, early dragon team damage, early lane opponent difficulty).\n\nThe second thing is the ward timings. Level ones are going to be much less chaotic. Before, it was actually more beneficial to go for the buff steal because that was the safest option. On top of that, it will be easier to ward the other teams jungle to see where they are actually going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gorbache","date":"2014-05-02T15:35:57.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the reason why it might impact the 4v0 lane is that you'll be able to throw 2-3 wards in your own jungle and 1-2 in the enemy jungle so you'll be able to get the jump on them when they try to invade and to have the defensive position is much stronger than being on a blind offensive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hentitan","date":"2014-05-01T02:35:10.355+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any buff to blue Trinket?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2014-05-01T15:32:05.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"B!tch please.

The weaker bot lane turret was one of the disincentives to force a lane swap, because the team initiating the swap was going to be at a tower push disadvantage as they pushed top slower than bot.\n\nTo preserve this trade-off mechanic, wouldn't it at least make sense--if you are going to fortify bot outer turret--to also fortify top inner turret?\n\nI wonder if there's also potential, since both top and bot outer turrets are fortified, whether it might actually become viable to fast push mid.

One of the complaints about lane swaps was the lack of aggressive champion interaction normally developed by lane play.  Currently, Teleport's reduced cooldown on turret weakens the ability to punish the champion with TP in lane for 2 reasons: 1) They get a free blue pill every 3 minutes to reverse any harass taken 2) it has such a valuable impact throughout the game that it becomes favorable to take it over Ignite even on lane bullies, further reducing the potential to outplay and punish an opponent in lane.  It's also, as we've seen, extremely powerful in level 1 strategies, having the potential to subdue other level 1 strats as a result.  It just has an immense power curve all game long.\n\nFinally, Teleport is particularly useful as a tool for late-game scaling champions to shore up their vulnerability in lane.  The problem is that it is arguably the most powerful summoner spell in the late game, and late-game champions are already very strong late game.  The addition of a game-changing split pushing tool like Summoner Teleport to complement their already overbearing late-game presence buffs these champions' power curve exactly in the point of the game they don't need it.  I'm sure there must be other solutions to assisting late-game champions' laning phase with less collateral influence on the other phases of the game.\n\nThe idea that even Renekton, arguably the strongest lane bully in the game, has difficulty shutting down for longer than the first 20 minutes a Jax or Ryze, two of the most late-game weighted champions, after only a minor buff to Ryze (and none to Jax), suggests perhaps that Teleport's buff is breaking the balance of top lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2014-05-02T14:32:46.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-05-01T00:57:29.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"I am going to say something that people are going to find maddening(meta sheep). 4 0 pushes were not that bad.
