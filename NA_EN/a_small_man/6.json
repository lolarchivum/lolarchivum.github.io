Ekko tenses. Giant hulking shadows always mean trouble in Zaun. He reaches for his Z Drive, activating it. There's a familiar hum and a flash of blue before he steps out of the shadows. \n\n\"Whatcha looking at, huh?\" Ekko yells out.\n\nThe shadow turns. Ekko freezes. It's green. Of course, it's green. Zaun apparently has a thing for green. It also looks like something his Ma cooked on the rare moments she's not beat down from work. Except, his Ma, bless her heart, really can't cook to save her life. It's all blobby and gooey looking with bright yellow eyes. Ekko doesn't have a clue what it is. But there's a good chance it's dangerous.\n\nGeez, can't he catch a break? He just drove away one jerk and here's another one lumbering in. Whatever. He can deal. He tightens his fist around his weapon.\n\nThe thing sees him tense and slowly, very slowly, raises up its hands? Those are hands, right?\n\n\"Hey, easy there, buddy.\" It speaks. Oh, wow. It speaks. Does that mean it has vocal chords? Lungs? Internal organs? \n\n\"I'm not your buddy.\" Ekko replies. \"And you didn't answer my question.\"\n\n\"I just - I saw your thing. It's a mural, isn't it?\"\n\n\"What's it to you?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for you loss.\"\n\nEkko blinks, his breath catching in his throat. That... was new. Zaun isn't as bad as others think it to be. Ekko knows that better than most everybody. Even his parents think Zaun is pretty much a garbage heap. But Ekko knows there's good people in it too. Still, compassion - from giant hulking green things, especially - is a rare find on the streets. It's probably really sad that Ekko is so shocked by such a small kindness. Yeah, actually, that's pretty sad.\n\n\"What do you care?\" He asks, when he finally finds his voice again. \"You didn't know them.\"\n\n\"I can still be sad they're gone, can't I?\" The thing furrows its brow. It has a brow, ok. And a mouth, well obviously. Seriously, what is this thing? \"You must have cared about them a lot to paint this. And the lamps too. I know batteries aren't easy to come by. Or lamps either. I know you probably won't believe me. But really, I am sorry for your loss.\"\n\nEkko swallows. He does, kind of, sorta, believe him. Maybe. It's still a weird thing and he doesn't really trust it much. But, he wants to believe in those few kind words. He's so tired of fighting. He's so damn tired.\n\n\"Ain't nothing you or I can do about it. Sorry doesn't fix things.\" He tells the thing.\n\nThe thing nods. \"Alright. Well then, what can I do to help you?\"\n\n\"What?\" It's just full of surprises, isn't it? But not the bad sort of surprise, and it's been too long since Ekko was pleasantly surprised. It's... nice?\n\n\"I can't help them, can I? But I can help you.\"\n\n\"I don't need any help. I do fine by myself.\"\n\n\"Ok. Then, um... how about a friend? Everybody needs a friend.\"\n\nEkko snorts. \"That is the corniest thing I've heard in the longest time.\"\n\nThe thing smiles. He's not so surprised it can smile. He's starting to think whatever it is, it would smile often. \"My name's Zac.\" It extends its hand.\n\n\"Zac, huh?\" Ekko looks warily at the offered hand, before carefully shaking it. Ok. Sure. Zac seems pretty chill. And he's got his z-drive in case things go south real quick. He'll give this guy a chance. Isn't that what he's all about? Chances? \"My friends call me Ekko.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Ekko.\"\n\nHe still doesn't know what's going to happen. If Zac is trustworthy or not. But for the first time, in such a long time, Ekko feels like it's a beginning and not an ending.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melkie","date":"2015-05-21T20:57:12.600+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is Ekko single?

I didn't quite get the use of that...\n\n1) We felt the Time magic space wasn't fully taken up with Zilean and were like,  \"What if we made a Time Assassin with Rewind?!?!?!?\"  Edmundo and Chris, came up with some great concept art of this punk Zaunite kid with a knowing smirk on his face and an hourglass on his back and it all clicked together from there\n\n3) Ajuna, Ekko's friend.\n\n4) MYSSTEREYREYERYEREY\n\n5) Ekko knew Vi when they were both younger before she left for Piltover.  He's got mixed feelings about her now.  On one hand he knows who she was and what she could be and that she's a good person, but on the other hand she sold out and is working for the Pilties now.\n\n6) Ekko stays in Zaun because he knows that it's not all bad.  People like Ajuna (the friend he lost in the comic) live there.  He believes in Zaun, and in it's future (although currently in a somewhat childlike and less forward thinking way, he's still a kid, still learning).  Also the only other option is what? going to Piltover?  He sees how they treat Zaun.  In Ekko's mind many corrupt Piltovian nobles are just as twisted as any Zaunite bad guy.\n\n8) Ekko has parents who are *gasp!* not dead.  They both work very hard and very long hours giving him a lot of time to do things on his own.\n\n9)Ekko, like Vi and Jinx, does not go by his given name.  Ekko was given to him by his friends.\n\n10) He does not keep himself young, his time powers are not able to reach across years like Zilean.  Ekko is straight up younger than Vi and Jinx\n\n12) the symbol over his ult's image is a UI element there for gameplay clarity (like the ones over Azir soldiers).

Lots of these have been answered elsewhere in the thread and probably in greater depth, too :)\n> \n> 1) What was the inspiration to design Ekko?\n\nThere are a lot of inspirations: we wanted to make a time-based champ that stood apart from Zilean, wanted to make a teenager, and wanted to make a character that shined a different light on Zaun. \n\n> \n> 2) How do you characterise Ekko? Any specific character traits he has?\n\nReckless, unrefined genius, rebellious. He's a brilliant teenager who tends to bite off more than he can chew and rewind endlessly to get the outcome he desires. \n\n> \n> 3) Who is the boy we saw in the comic?\n\nHis friend, Ajuna. If you watch the trailer animation, he's on the memorial wall. \n\n> \n> 4) Speaking of the comic: Apperantly the boy is on the mural because Ekko couldn't save him (if he could, he wouldn't be dead; So not saving and dead go hand in hand here) Is that the reason Jinx is also on the mural? Because Ekko couldn't save her? (she went crazy instead)\n\nI don't see Jinx on the memorial...\n\n> \n> 5) What is his relation to VI? Are the rumours true Jinx, VI and Ekko were in the same gang?\n\nI doubt they were in the same gang, as Ekko is younger than those two. But Ekko knows them, they were aware of each other. \n\n> \n> 6) If so, what keeps Ekko in Zaun? It seems like a pretty bad place to live, why is he so proud of this city-state? Or are we fooled by media to think that Zaun is a pretty ugly place?\n\nIt's home and he knows the people. Ekko isn't dumb, he knows Zaun is a rough place, but he owns that. Zaun made him strong, taught him to be resourceful and make big things out little. He's starting to envision a different Zaun, a better Zaun, but he doesn't have the complete picture yet as he is a teenager and still has some growing up to do. \n\n> \n> 7) What does the XII on his sword mean? Any connections to VI (6) or Jinx's X (10)? Oh, and Caitlyns Nemesis C (100)?\n> \n> 8) VI doesn't remember her parents or her real name (or where her tattoo came from), does the same apply to Ekko?\n> \n\nEkko still shares residence with his parents. They are caught up in the Zaun grind and are rarely home, leaving Ekko with large chunks of unsupervised time. \n\n> 9) Is Ekko his real name? Did he call himself Ekko because of his timey-wimey-abilities?\n> \n\n> 10) Ekko seems pretty young. If we consider that he knows both Jinx and VI (before the one went crazy and the other joined the cops) is it possible that he keeps himself young with his timey-wimey-abilities?\n\nHe does not. If anything, all those brushes with disaster coupled with the endless rewinds probably have made him age more. \n\n> \n> 11) Will there be more information about Zaun, Ekko and lore in genereal in near future?\n\nMost likely, but I can't speak to when/where/what. \n> \n> 12) I wonder: Why does Ekko has this symbol over his head while he ults?

Mechanically, making an assassin AP locks him out from certain benefits AD grants (such as powerful basic attacks, lifesteal, and crazy tower taking).  This allowed us to make his spells and utility stronger.\n\n2) VK prolly just wants to disintegrate him to \"get dat knowledge\"\n\n3) Ekko is pretty reckless in the use of his Z-Drive, I'm guessing Zilean (or Bard) might be somewhat concerned over the rippling affects of twiddling with the time stream.\n\n4) So he had this hextech time device so it was Zaun or Piltover for sure.  We liked Zaun because we've got a lot of villians from there but not many very appealing heroes (Vi moved to Piltover), felt we could strengthen the faction as well as tell better stories with Ekko being from Zaun.  There was also a degree of Ezreal overlap with a Piltovian Ekko.

Was Ajuna's killer the final straw?\n\nEkko's always had a distaste for Piltover. Seeing friends and other people leave Zaun for the City of Progress gave him a bit of a chip on his shoulder. \n\nAjuna's killer being from Piltover certainly didn't help. \n\n> \n> 2) Is it right to assume Ekko is the one who paints the mural?\n\nParts of it, definitely. Like in other urban cities where violence/accidents claim lives, these street memorials are very communal, often with many contributors. Lots of people lose those they love. \n> \n> 3) Is the hourglass on his face a tattoo, a birthmark, or painted?\n\nPainted! \n\n> \n> 4) Is the gang Vi was in Ekko's group?\n\nI doubt it, personally, because of their age difference, but they are aware of each other. \n\n> \n> 5) How does Ekko feel about Yordles?\n\nI don't think he's formulated an opinion, having only heard stories about them and never meeting one. \n\n> \n> 6) What champions can be Ekko's friends? And enemies?\n\nGood question. I'm sure that Ekko would eventually put aside his disappointment with Vi, and maybe one day he'd befriend Caitlyn. But both of those are big IFs. \n\nEnemies? Viktor, Mundo, Singed. \n\nHe doesn't think too fondly of Jayce or Ezreal most likely.\n\n> \n> 7) Is Twitch really Mr. Tails?\n\nMany rats escape into sewers, some things we can never know for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2015-05-21T21:37:57.388+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=xEVZQjPL,comment-id=00580000,timestamp=2015-05-21T21:19:01.978+0000)\n> Enemies?

She's one of the defectors. He thinks she gave up on Zaun, which is something Ekko will never do. \n\nLet me also state that Ekko does not think Zaun is perfect.
