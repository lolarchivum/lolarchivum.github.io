How There was a story behind every character and there was a reason for their abilities and dialogue to be what it is.\r\n\r\n-Let&#039;s start with Soraka, she was the first aspect of the cosmos and  Warwick ruined her life as a mad chemist and as a commoner. Now that Warwick is just some guy Singed turned into a chimera. Soraka needs an update.\r\n\r\n-On that same note, Warwick was a beast from the beginning, he unleashed chaos during the war with Ionia and Singed was his student but tables turned and now Warwick is just Singed&#039;s creation.\r\n\r\n-Caitlin, who is C? How did he survive the fall? Why isn&#039;t C a champion yet?\r\n\r\n-The Rune Wars, World Runes, Rize now seeking them. What happened there? Why the war? Poor Skarner and his brethren.\r\n\r\n-Now that we have knowledge on Icathia and how they led the void into Valoran. Did it only affect Icathia or did it spread? Vastaya are the result of humans escaping the Void War and Vastayashai&#039;rei (So it obviously got as far as Ionia). The Watchers rule the void and seems like they had the most influence at the Freljord creating the Iceborn and all. \r\n\r\n-I also would love some Clarifying on the timeline. I know most champions are alive and some have been alive since Aurelion created Runeterra. Like can we have some cool thing with how things have progress and stuff like that like:\r\n\r\nYear X Creation of Runeterra - Year X Rune Wars (This and This Happened) - Year X Great Void War (This Happened, This Champion Showed Up)\r\n\r\n-Also, are disputes still settled in the League of Legends, like Ionia and Noxus was? Why don&#039;t we have more events like this? Why don&#039;t we have missions to play with Champions in a specific role or factions? Honestly if we&#039;re not gonna get EA from matches might as well give us missions every day.\r\n\r\n-Did anyone survive the Blessed Isles Massacre? People from Icathia survived, can we get champs hailing from these places? Also, all those places that haven&#039;t been touched In years like:\r\n\r\nIronspike Mountain, Urtistan, Fyrone Flats, Kumungu, Plague Jungles, Sablestone Mountains, Voodoo Lands, Tempest Flast, Mogron Pass, Mount Garganinan, Bubbling Bog, Serpentine River. (We need the map updated)\r\n\r\nAre there other continents or is Valoran the Pangaea of Runeterra?\r\n\r\nAnd can we have League Judgement back? That was pretty cool.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of other stuff in mind but this is long enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-03-06T18:39:42.986+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.

I keep saying we're going to release a new map (and we are!) but it's not being released today.  This year (unless disaster occurs) but not immediately.\n\nSounds like you've been away from the lore for a little while now, so while I agree with GreenLore's suggestion to check out Universe (which is trying to become the one-stop-shop for story in League) I can link you specifically to one of the more recent partial maps: the [Medarda Heirloom](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/piltover/medarda-heirloom) showing the area around Piltover and Zaun, as far north as Noxus, and a bit of the Shuriman continent too.\n\nWelcome back? :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-06T21:40:05.599+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka is high priority.

Someone who lost part of her being by giving in to despair and anger. It was just so good, even if you had to dig around a bit to get all the details, case in point being that she was mentioned in old Karma's League Judgment. Just... bring back the celestial being defined by war, and not the dumb unicorn that got lured out of her magic glade.

(We need the map updated)\n\n\nYorick is more or less a survivor of the massacre,as the holy water kept him alive.\n\nUrtistan was likely retconned,as Zileans new short bio says that he is from Icathia as well(in general it sounds like you should check out the universe site)\nhttps://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/champion/zilean/\n\nMount Gargantuan was renamed into Targon long ago,its the same mountain.\n\nThe voodoo lands were retconned with Annies new lore,her homeland doesn't have a name that we know of,but it is appearantly part of the noxian empire(just not Noxus itself).\n\n> \n> Are there other continents or is Valoran the Pangaea of Runeterra?\n\n\nIonia and Shurima are actually seperate continents.\nThough Valoran and Shurima are connected by a small dot of land,so the 2 are similar to europe and asia.\n\n\n> \n> And can we have League Judgement back? That was pretty cool.\n\n\nWith the league not existing anymore,the league judgements are gone too.\nWe instead tend to get a \"color story\",which is an additional small story that shows the champion doing their stuff.\n\n> \n> I have a lot of other stuff in mind but this is long enough.\n\n\nIf you've got any more questions feel free to ask :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-03-06T18:01:30.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uMGqVEXE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-06T17:46:34.570+0000)\n>\n> The voodoo lands were retconned with Annies new lore,her homeland doesn&#x27;t have a name that we know of,but it is appearantly part of the noxian empire(just not Noxus itself).\n\nShe lives in the Ironspike Mountains now.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-03-06T18:10:19.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it is described as \n> a piece of land beyond the Ironspike Mountains to the north\n\nwhich sounds to me like it lies directly adjacent to the mountains,but isn't part of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-03-06T18:13:51.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uMGqVEXE,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-03-06T18:10:19.461+0000)\n>\n> Well it is described as \n> \n> which sounds to me like it lies directly adjacent to the mountains,but isn&#x27;t part of them.\n\nOh right, anyways, Is one of those places that the OP mentioned and still a place mentioned in the new lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-06T21:37:55.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beyond =/= adjacent\n\nIt's further than the Ironspike Mountains (and the Delverhold) which according to 'The Principles of Strength' is pretty far from the capital. :-)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KestrelGirl","date":"2018-03-06T17:21:27.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Soraka's high priority for new lore.\nC is PROBABLY Camille, just FYI.\nRune Wars were basically a huge battle to control magic.\nVoid rifts are showing up all over the place in Shurima, partially thanks to the work of Malzahar.\nI'm working on an age list for champs that should help clarify.\nDisputes are either not settled or they become actual in-lore war.\nYorick survived. Maokai survived. Kalista, Hecarim, etc became spirits.\nIronspike Mountains are along the border of Noxus. Serpentine River I think is now officially in the Serpent Isles.
