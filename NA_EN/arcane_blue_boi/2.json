It was due to the winter storm. Infrastructure in the southeast doesn't really do well in the cold (we're very, very resistant to burying our data lines, keeping them on telephone poles :P). This fiber cut was a LONG way from where I live. It was a major line further up north in Georgia. But the fiber failure affected people far away from the cut, from NC all the way down to Alabama and Florida.\n\nI came back to the game, caught up, contributed, and even WON.... aaaaaaaaaaand... I was penalized and received nothing for that game (it was norms) due to \"AFK behavior\". Now apply this to a ranked game.

The system does not work that way.  I have had friends that have left games and have not received a penalty, the only thing that happens is you get a message that *warns* you about leaving games and you must agree to not do it again by typing \"I Agree\".  So long as you do not leave any more games for a fairly lengthy period of time then you will not receive any further sanctions.  That's how the system works.  \n\n >It isn't because I'm toxic (honor 5 and I rarely tilt) nor because I want to leave games.\n\nLeaverbuster is simply about leaving games, period.  Irrespective of your reasons, Leaverbuster flags you if you leave games repeatedly or even infrequently and you can get penalized... this does not apply to just ONE game, however.  \n\n \n>I don't see how its fair to punish me for things that are outside my control, \n\nI don't see how it's fair to play a game with someone that leaves for whatever reason.  If you leave only one game, then the system won't punish you outside of the warning I mentioned, if you do it again or have a pattern of leaving games, then you get punished.  As for the classic \"things come up that take precedence\", that's fine... if you're finding that this is happening frequently enough to where you are getting penalized for leaving games, then League is just not the game for you, simple as that.  \n\nThis is a team reliant game that requires a certain uninterrupted time commitment, if you cannot fulfill that obligation or feel that there is a *chance* that you cannot, then do not play.  You talk about fairness, but then fail to recognize the *fairness* regarding the other nine players that you punish by leaving (for whatever reason).  \n\n>nor do I understand why you're making assumptions that this guy is lying when he has a perfectly valid point.\n\nBecause what he said doesn't make sense and if it doesn't make sense then it isn't true.  You don't get penalized for leaving one, and only one, game.","replies":[{"poster":"LiL Bunnie FuFuu","date":"2017-12-17T20:15:40.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"You talk about fairness, but then fail to recognize the fairness regarding the other nine players that you punish by leaving\" I do recognize that but sometimes_ it is not in my control_.

And time wont solve that, cus i spent nearly 8 months without playing, and the first game i went afk (after playing again) i was banned already","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zeetz","date":"2017-12-17T03:38:15.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two words, NET NEUTRALITY.\n\nAs the FCC rolled back 'net neutrality', ISP and cable providers will most likely throttle back gamers' connections to game servers. As this issue continues to gain optics by end-users and providers, the end of net neutrality will create increase in LB incidents.  My hope is RIOT will recognize the players have no control of 'throttling' and 'prioritization' that will undoubtedly affect the entire fan base.  In the next few months, RIOT should be monitoring this issue, CLOSELY, and return to modifying LB based on those findings.  I suspect many fans will find their games cut short, disconnected, and even blocked to game servers as providers and ISPs begin implementing 'pay to play' bandwidth, or be stuck at the bottom of bandwidth ladder for your region.","replies":[{"poster":"The Pussiologist","date":"2017-12-17T20:37:52.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you realize this is worse case scenario and if it even happens it wont be for months to years before its escalated to a point that wont matter because the only people who are screwed by this fantasy is people who are way too dependent on certain companies because of their geographical locations.
