More or less gay stuff as imagined by women, for women(the overwhelming majority of yaoi is made by women).\n\n\nThe japanese have categories for everything. My examples are straight-up hentai, more or less perverted hardcore pornography animated instead of acted.\n\nTo answer your question; not necessarily. Personally, I wouldn't classify it as homosexual pornography. Would you have a son with homoerotic sexual orientation, or a daughter that likes seeing men on homoerotic acts, I'd suggest simply showing him some softcore gay porn, since Boku no Pico is pretty much perversion through and through(20 year old dude, engaging in multiple hardcore sex escapades with a boy in his early teens that likes to dress as a girl). \n\nI'll be honest here, those examples are humorous, under no circumstances to be taken seriously. What they depict is straight up stupidly perverse and sick, made to cater to the curious and/or straight up perverted.
