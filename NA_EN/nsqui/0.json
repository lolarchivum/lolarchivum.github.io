Gangplank is a ruthless leader figure of Bilgewater--also no reason to join hands with the Institute of War.\n\nThen there's new champions like Gnar and Rek'Sai, who have no ties to any organizations to represent, or have any desires to fight.\n\n\nThe retcon did leave a lot of holes and Riot needs to fix them, but I don't think retcon was all bad.

TF has a proper hometown and an origin story now. He was exiled because he fought for what he believed in, even though it was in conflict with people he lived with. He wants to explain to Graves what really happened. He cares about his fashion a lot.\nGraves is a character hell-bent on revenge, but there's this little bits of humanity inside him, like when he gives the Piltovian bartender a silver serpent to pay for the door.\n\n\"Stealing shit and running away\" is TF's core identity, and by stripping a character into just their core identity can make any developed character simple. Indiana Jones is just a treasure hunter who wants to put everything in the museum. Harry Potter is just a kid who wants to stop Voldemort. Batman is a guy who wants to take law into his own hands. Besides, it's not like the old lore was any better in this regard.\n\n\nYou say that explaining why a champion joined the Institute was one of the reasons why the old lore was better, but honestly they were all just either \"to represent this faction\"  or \"to fight because of revenge/they like fighting.\"\n\n\nAlso, just to clarify, I'm not saying that retcon was a good decision.\nBefore retcon, each match actually meant something, unlike other MOBAs or Super Smash Bros, where characters fight for some reason? A lot of champions have lines referring to \"the summoner,\" which gave players more immersion. That was good. Now post-retcon those are just some flavor quotes.\nDespite that, some good came from retcon, although I don't know if the benefits have outweighed the costs. Post-retcon, they don't have to explain why Braum would be joining the League. They could put something like \"to represent Avarosa,\" but then they might as well put \"lorem ipsum\" there instead. Instead of putting in why they joined the League, they get to put other things the champion did, like how Braum rescued a troll child stuck behind a magical door.\nI'm just saying that retcon did some good, instead of all bad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bhargo","date":"2015-07-26T01:32:30.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TF wanted magic, and League can help him get stronger.
