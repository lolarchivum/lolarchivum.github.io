The destruction of Assassin Ahri in order to make her mage playstyle better is absolutely insane.

I would have to play with it before I formed a real opinion :V\n\nAnd really, Fokufu needs more buffs period. The ability feels *incredibly* weak and filler on her kit. Like Cassio's Q does-- it feels like a button that you hit and then ignore.\n\nSo instead of **removing** the Charm amplification, **reduce the duration**.\n\ne.g. from 6 seconds to 3-4 seconds.\n\nThen, remove the penalty for saving your Spirit Rushes (the CD starts on last cast instead of on first).\n\nI'd prefer the MS effect be on her W as a passive, like the Furor enchant, instead of her Q [it'd force her to be closer to enemies and as a result make healthier gameplay].\n\nOh, and for her Q to get a few points of extra damage so it can more reliably clear waves. :V","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riftic","date":"2015-01-19T22:31:59.676+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"To Riot:\n\nI have no idea what you're even thinking. She's supposed to be getting compensated for a core item being removed, so what do you do? You drastically cut her damage at all stages of the game - even before taking the removal of DFG into account!\n\nIf those PBE changes kept her charm amp, then these changes would be passable.
