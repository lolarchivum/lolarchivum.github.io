Trying out a different approach here with just quick updates on a number of topics rather than a focus on a couple of things (feedback on that much appreciated!).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Preseason:\r\n\r\n* We&#039;ve been putting a lot of work into updates for the upcoming preseason patch over the last couple of months, with changes to champions, items, vision etc. We&#039;re getting very close to putting that stuff on PBE (all going according to plan).\r\n\r\n\r\nKindred:\r\n\r\n* Kindred have been out for about a week now and we&#039;re starting to see players get to grips with their kit. So far we&#039;ve been really happy with the state of their release balance, so 5.21 won&#039;t contain any buffs or nerfs, just some bug fixes. Really interested to see where they end up over the next couple of patches, there&#039;s some definite learning curve there and we&#039;re also seeing people experiment with them in a range of positions with a mix of success and failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMordekaiser:\r\n\r\n* Morde&#039;s a pretty topical dude at the moment. Our belief is that he&#039;s too strong in a duo lane, despite previous nerfs, so we&#039;re going to be reducing the amount of bonus XP he gets from his W in 5.21. Our hope is that that will then give us some room to buff his base stats, bringing his solo laning closer to his duo lane performance. That&#039;s something we&#039;ll likely do as a follow up change though (potentially in 5.22), once we&#039;ve got a read on what the impact of the XP reduction was.\r\n\r\n* Thematic side note for anyone that&#039;s interested and hadn&#039;t already heard - we&#039;ll also be changing his title to &#039;The Iron Revenant&#039; rather than the previous &#039;Lord of Death&#039; (Iron Revenant being a player suggested title update that we felt did a great job of merging different thematic elements from Morde).\r\n\r\n\r\nPoppy\r\n\r\n* Works heavily underway on Poppy. She&#039;ll be the next really big champion update that goes out (Sion/GP sort of scale, so full overhaul of abilities, visuals, voice etc). Her E&#039;s the only ability effectively ported over from her old kit, feel we&#039;re going for&#039;s still very much small, noble, determined warrior who smacks others around with a large hammer. \r\n\r\n\r\nWorld Champs\r\n\r\n* Worlds has been getting a lot of attention for the Gameplay teams of course. We&#039;ve been really enjoying the diversity of picks in some positions (mid lane especially), though are seeing that some others could do with more help (jungle for example). Some outlier champions that definitely seem too strong (Morde, GP, Darius etc), some of whom we&#039;ve already nerfed post 5.18, some of which we&#039;ve got stuff underway for. A number of champions too that we don&#039;t yet have plans for, but are keeping a really close eye on and talking about quite a bit (Tahm Kench for example).  \r\n\r\n\r\nUpcoming Champs\r\n\r\n* We&#039;ve had a couple of trends with new champions recently that have helped opened up new gameplay space (non damage utility ults) and thematic space (creatures of myth). We&#039;ve been pretty happy with how those explorations have gone, we don&#039;t have to overdo them though. Next set of champs we&#039;ve got underway are going for a bit of contrast with that as a result, with a few more damage/combat focused ults and characters who are somewhat more a part of the regular world of Runeterra. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Balance Changes\r\n\r\n* Since a lot&#039;s going to change in the upcoming preseason patch we&#039;re generally holding off on smaller balance changes for a little bit, given which characters are a bit too weak or a bit too strong could change significantly in the near future due to systemic changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-10-21T00:27:37.474+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":7,"body":"Pretty cool that the player suggested title for Morde is what's being used.

I can't pick Nami competitively because I'm essentially telling my team that I can't do much for us in terms of vision, for fear of running into a tank engage/pick support. Is there any insight on how to alleviate the burden of instantly losing the vision game if you choose to pick a traditional support?\n\n* Janna was nerfed before Worlds because she's a champion whose existence, as Riot have stated in the past, prevents things from happening in game. i.e., \"We can't really engage here because that Janna will just disengage\".

Some people are talking about Morde, some are talking vision, some asking about new champs and Ao Shin; Sorting through all that to get to the comments about one topic is a bit of a crawl.\n\nIs there some way the boards people can program a single topic and have multiple comment threads inside it? For example, you post the OP, and players can create sub-topics specifically addressing different sections of your post. (One for Morde, one for vision, one for this or that). That way you can have separate, concentrated discussions, but have them all grouped together.

We don't want to simply replace it with a guaranteed damage multiplier as a result and, whenever we do work on it, would want to bundle that with some other systemic changes.\n\nI feel mana management's a useful lever to have, both in terms of the control it offers over champion power at various points in the game and as an expression of player skill. Having said that I don't feel that all characters should be mana gated equally. Some melee should arguably be gated in lane, but free to use spells generally on CD later in the game, given the challenges they have getting onto targets. Other long range characters, or healers, by contrast should generally have significant costs throughout the game. \n\nResourceless characters and energy users are both types of champion I feel have a good place in the game in terms of the different playstyles, pacings (in lane and after) and abilities designs they allow. I do believe it's healthy to have mana as the default resource however, with occasional exceptions and we'll be going through a period of new champions who consistently use mana for a while (last non mana user was Rek'Sai, next 4 upcoming champions at least will probably all use mana). \n\nI believe it's very possible for high and low mobility champions to coexist in lanes, I don't think we've always given lower mobility champions sufficient compensation for the low mobility price they pay however. Being a low mobility champ should allow you to get access to some pretty powerful stuff that wouldn't be appropriate on champs with dashes/blinks etc. Kog'Maw and Anivia are good examples to me of where that's been done right, with both of them being options that more mobile marksmen/mages respectively don't offer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2015-10-21T00:42:36.804+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thank you for the communication Meddler - always love to see these updates.\n\nPosts like this are very meaningful to the community, just like taking the suggestion for the morde title.
