The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Post-Midseason stability**\r\n\r\nNow that all the midseason changes, bar the couple of new fighter items, are out, we&#039;re going to focusing mainly on polish and stability until preseason. We&#039;ve made quite a lot of changes recently and want to pair that with a period of low systemic change. That will mean patches being more just balance adjustments, and less major overhauls of anything. That&#039;s something we aim for each year after midseason, as we hit the second half of the ranked season and the run up to Worlds. Looking at the amount of change we&#039;ve made this year though, and the style in which it&#039;s come out, it feels extra important to do. \r\n\r\nIn particular, spreading midseason changes out over a few patches was more disruptive than we&#039;d anticipated. We were hoping to minimize the shake up of any individual patch and keep things steadier since we&#039;d have time to react to each set of changes separately. In retrospect though the outcome was more a period of constant readjustment than greater stability. We&#039;ll be aiming to cluster changes back in a single patch more in the future as a result.  \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Systemic change we will still be looking at**\r\n\r\nWe will still be doing some work to pull back early snowball, as mentioned last week. Even though we&#039;re looking for a period of stability we think that&#039;s important enough that it needs to be done regardless. The systemic changes already in 8.12 (2 new fighter items plus nerfs to Heal/Shield items and some gifted shield durations) are still planned as well. Beyond that things should be fairly light until November. It&#039;s also likely preseason&#039;s more focused this year on improving various existing parts of the game than adding new elements, though we&#039;ve yet to plan preseason out in full detail. \r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Godmaker","date":"2018-06-06T18:13:22.748+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is the bringing mages into bot lane thing canned? or is that coming in preseason.

They work on content that doesn't' need to be worked on but have an excuse for not working on what really needs to. After five years and six months of dealing with Meddler, Morello, and Reav3s . . . there is no excuse as to why Karma cannot have any work done on her. Dedicated Karma mains and myself have been creating threads for years now asking this single Developer to work on a champion that has been blatantly ignored for years now. Every year he says she needs work, has an identity problem, is a mess, and will probably get work done later on in the year. I only started being vocal 3 to 4 years ago and communicating with Developers. Think of all the mains who have been asking for 5 years and 6 months. Past and present Developers are purposely ignoring Karma mains and we are now getting to a point that being nice, offering our suggestions, and giving them the benefit of the doubt is not working. The excuses and community that is defending their horrible, bias work ethic is not acceptable.\n\nWe have Lissandra mains asking for work to be done on her for months now. We have Morde mains pleading for reverts, revisions, or a VGU that is consistently ignored. We have FIzz mains waiting for reverts like LB received. We have Malzahar mains asking for his kit to be looked at since he is no longer fun to play because of recent work on him. Finally, we have Karma being brought up daily, weekly, monthly and yearly with the same passive aggressive answers that say they are aware of her problems, but choose to work on Ahri and Lux for more than 3 months and 4 patch cycles, give Ryze 4 reworks and 2 VGU, and prioritize work on anything that isn't the right thing to work on.\n\nExcuse me if I am a little upset and no longer care about your complete devotion to a Developer that has shown a clear favoritism towards the same champions every year. I no longer care about his feelings and I am not even being that mean to him. I calling him out on his choices and work ethic. His work ethic and comments clearly show that through-out the years he is aware of the problems with all of the above champions, but chooses to prioritize work on champions like Ahri, Lux, and Ryze every year. Ahri received 3 reworks the past 3 years that didn't really do that much for her, all because she had a sub-par winrate that has always been higher than Karma's. Get over yourself and accept that fact that there are a lot of players out there who are really annoyed with being ignored year after year for the same content to be worked on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dakeudharma","date":"2018-06-06T21:51:35.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been patient for 2 seasons on weak karma.

They cannot give him any work unless they are removing something about his kit. No one likes playing against him.\n\n{{champion:102}} {{champion:90}}  do deserve reworks and Malzahar needs a revert.\n\n-----------\n\nShields did need a nerf and the work they are doing; however, they should have the work ethic to address the fact that some Enchanter shields need to be more unique and stand out. I mean the problem is we have newer champions with more interesting mechanics with their shields than just some stat buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"T1GK","date":"2018-06-07T03:43:18.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO ADC has always mostly been about the carry part. And removing the old IE hurt a lot of ADC's potentials to carry, turning them from glass canons to glass stones. If fallen behind adcs feel worse than ever. As and ADC main I live for the all or nothing supersnowball games, but when an entire position can't even do any damage to the enemy morgana because you're so behind, theres an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Recons","date":"2018-06-06T21:39:15.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good afternoon Meddler, I hope this day finds you well. \n\nI realize that you guys have been moving to quicker more interactive games, cutting the game time averages by a significant amount, adding snowball mechanics to make it harder to come back from a game, and increasing mana, and cooldown reduction accessibility.\n\nHowever lately, it seems like you guys have been moving back to a slower gameplay and removing snowball mechanics, I was wondering if you could expand on the current vision of the game?\n\nWhat are you guys trying to achieve on the big scope of things?\n\nAdditionally, with the incremental buffs to duelists, divers, and assassins (The upcoming Sterak's Gage, granting bonus AD buffs all AD assassins and divers unless they bought Trinity Force, Spear of Shojin, and Atma's Reckoning), I am afraid this will increase the amount of games that are dictated by a \"raid-boss\" type player dominating the entire map. And with the current state of critical damage (not chance, but the amount of damage Marksmen deal) Marksmen will not have enough damage to kill a duelist before getting dove and killed themselves. \n\nSo by making games shorter, and delaying Crit based power spikes, Marksmen will not be able to complete their core items, fulfill their power fantasy, and perform their intended role of dealing the most damage per second. This leads me to the following question, what is the current role of crit-based marksmen? How do they fit into a team composition? And how will they be able to complete their items before the game ends at 22 mins. \n\nTo wrap it up, I suspect these might be all interconnected, is your vision of the game a more \"fighter style\" game? Since crit marksmen don't have any flashy abilities or amazing outplay potential besides kiting and right clicking, you are nerfing them to make space for more interactive marksmen, like Lucian. While at the same time nerfing tanks with huge amounts of true damage, since tanks don't have flashy kits either, and buffing duelists to encourage fights in the top lane. \n\nI really appreciate you taking your time to write this! And good luck on the rift.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lument","date":"2018-06-06T19:54:59.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nAny further buffs for Kassadin? The shield buff helped him just barely and has been receiving indirect nerfs. (Minion Change, resolve nerf and ultimate hat swapped to nimbus).","replies":[]}]}
