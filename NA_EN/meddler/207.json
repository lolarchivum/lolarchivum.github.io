We&#039;ll likely do an 8.24b though, similar to 7.24b last year, that&#039;s just a bunch of gameplay changes as preseason followup and general balance, address things that would otherwise be known issues over the holiday break.\r\n* Preseason changes will be on the PBE for longer than a normal patch cycle (probably 4 weeks instead of 2, for at least some of the changes)\r\n* There&#039;ll be some non gameplay stuff also happening during the preseason (e.g. ranked changes). Those are on a different timing, so won&#039;t necessarily be in patch 8.23.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Future of Nexus Blitz**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re most of the way through assessing how Nexus Blitz went at this point. Should have a dev blog with a whole bunch of details in it covering things like what we learned, major trends from feedback gathered, how we&#039;re thinking about addressing some issues that arose and some thoughts around if/when we&#039;ll have a revised Nexus Blitz available.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Couple of possible 8.20 changes**\r\n\r\n* Pyke - We&#039;ll be looking at Pyke in 8.20, specifically reducing his effectiveness with tank builds. They&#039;re outperforming AD builds by a pretty decent margin, and Pyke keeps his strengths generally while muting his weaknesses a lot when building tank. Not sure yet what exact direction we&#039;ll be going, shifting damage from base to ratios is one option, though does also increase how snowbally he is.\r\n\r\n* Hail of Blades/Jhin - We&#039;ll also be looking to do some work on Jhin and/or HoB, given just how much mobility it offers him. Potentially involves reducing the amount of move speed he gets from the attack speed conversion and then buffing some other part of his kit so that non HoB builds aren&#039;t penalized. Also possible we do some work on HoB in preseason instead, potentially with a temporary change to Jhin until then.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"fighter154","date":"2018-09-26T15:46:37.342+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"But meddler when the new colorful mage will be revealed?

I thought of a few ideas. Now these are just ideas and I am not asking for all or any of them to be implemented. I'm just asking if you could look at my buffs individually and say why or why not you would give him buffs. Also do you have any future plans for Viktor at all?\n\nStats - Increase Viktor’s AA by 25. Allows Viktor to proc q autos more easily in teamfights.\n\nQ - Increase augmented movement speed from 30% to 40%. With so much more mobility in LoL nowadays Viktor would need someway to escape or catch up to his targets faster.\n\nW - Increase slow from 28%-44% to 38% - 45%. With all of the mobility in League, no one is going to be trapped in his W at rank 1 and since you rank this last, it just feels like you can never get them stunned unless they are chain cc'ed.\n\nW - Enemies who stand in Gravity Field will take 10% more damage from all sources. This would make gravity field feel more like a threat rather than just a zoning tool and would increase Viktor's teamfight potential.\n\nE - Lower aftershock delay from 1.0 seconds to 0.8 or 0.85 seconds. Now I know why you had to increase it from 0.6 seconds. But 1.0 seconds is too much as it will almost never hit unless they are cc'ed. The only reason the delay needed to be raised was because of Rylai's. But that is now nerfed and useless on Viktor. So a 0.8 second delay would make it feel like its not impossible to land it when they are not cc'ed.\n\nR - Increase max and min movement speed by 50. Again this was nerfed because of Rylai. Rylai is useless now and it is rare for Viktor to get any damage off from it after the initial discharge. So this would make it feel a little more possible for Viktor to actually get some ticks off from his ult onto his enemies.\n\nR - Viktor can control his ult even after he dies AND/OR in stasis. I dunno about this one I just thought it would feel more satisfying. Especially when you die and your ult is just sitting there doing nothing. Also when he needs to get Zhonya's it would just feel like a nice interaction to have against a harder matchup. I just felt like this would be a nice QoL buff.\nBut yeah what do you think about these buffs individually. And why or why not would you give him these buffs. I'm just interested in hearing your reasoning and thoughts on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-09-26T16:03:58.624+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, just to set context, I'm not sure how much we should or shouldn't be buffing Viktor at present. I also haven't played that much Viktor myself, so while I'm happy to offer some thoughts on different approaches they'll be coming more from a place of theory than experience.\n\nAA range - I suspect that would add power more to Viktor's laning phase than teamfights looking at how changes to AA ranges have affected other champs in the past. If difficulty proccing Q is the issue to solve I'd just add a tiny bit of extra range to the Q empowered attack instead (or add a bit more if it's already got some and I'm unaware). That avoids adding extra power to his CSing and base AA harass in lane if that's not desirable. \n\nQ and W haste/slow - For arguments like these I'd start with an assessment of what Viktor's strengths and weaknesses should be, then look at how the current state of those abilities does or doesn't match those targets. Without doing that too high a risk of just pushing in power without consideration of what the desired outcome beyond 'stronger' is.\n\nW damage amp - Highly skeptical of this one. Team damage amps tend to be extremely strong, particularly if they're AOE and/or immediately applied. Satisfaction for them is generally pretty low though, relative to their power. I'm not aware of player desire or kit needs that would push Viktor towards being more ally dependent, so I can see thematic argument for this approach but not much else.\n\nE delay and R speed - This is a case where I'd need to play against Viktor in his current state more to speak with any confidence. Rylai's is certainly a much more niche item on him than it used to be, so it's possible tuning for needed counterplay has changed. At the same time though Viktor's historically had some really reliable damage output, so I'd be somewhat hesitant to strip counterplay out. Again though, this is one I feel least confident about answering.\n\nR control during stasis/death - Death I don't think's the right call at all. With rare exceptions (zombie passives) once you've killed an enemy champion they're deliberately unable to actively retaliate against you and I think that's an appropriate rule. If we were making Viktor today could see some argument for having his ult vanish on death instead, probably wouldn't make that change though given it's been this way a long time. From memory functions it that way in large part because Tibbers continued to exist post Annie's death and Viktor R's prototype started with a copy of Annie R. Reactivation during stasis is an ongoing topic for us internally. Zoe was a test case for whether we should potentially be making reactivation abilities useable while stasis'd or CC'd. Debate on whether that's been a good thing that we should apply to other reactivateable abilities or something we should strip off Zoe continues though.","replies":[{"poster":"shofaz","date":"2018-09-26T16:14:58.434+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for the reply!

After his harsh nerfs, it was said he would be buffed in the form of sustained damage, tankiness, regen, etc. He was given a 8% attack speed buff, which would help with sustained damage a bit...\n\n\nHowever, right now, he feels good in very few aspects (late game damage) and bad in a lot of aspects. The \"bad\" aspects include his mana pool (7th lowest mana with high mana costs), his rank 1 Q doing 10 damage, and his jungle clear prior to tiamat. His passive also does not fit his kit and most effective builds (assassin style). \n\nI understand his burst was way too high, but as of right now, it feels like he was nerfed in the only area he was useful - burst damage. If his tankiness was increased so he is less of a glass cannon, his mana was increased / mana costs decreased, or if his Q did more damage (or striked multiple targets like his E), he'd feel like such a more useful champion without blowing up ADCs with no counterplay.\n\nTo summarize, while the 8% attack speed buff was nice, I don't think it brought Wukong up to a place where he's particularly useful in the jungle. I understand he has a slightly above 50% win rate, but with such a minimal play rate, that sample size doesn't feel like it truly reflects his usefulness. His early game is way too weak as of now, and I think Wukong mains would appreciate if his current state was acknowledged and if there are any plans to make changes to him.

Especially with different emotes fitting better with certain roles (The tent with jungle). The issue this causes is less time in champ select. After keystone and summoner spells, you only have a couple seconds to get the emotes you want on your wheel. If I play against a blitzcrank, I want the blitzcrank emote. If I'm playing jinx I want all 6 of the jinx emotes.. If I'm playing BEEMO I NEED THE BEE EMOTES. \n\n\n\n I designed a wheel that had 9 slots.

Jhin having very limited usable runes in the rest of the minor runes (running Taste of Blood, Eyeball collection and Ravenous Hunter) shows weakness in options.
