The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Fewer champion gameplay updates coming for a little bit**\r\n\r\nFor a little while (approximately the rest of the year) we&#039;ll be putting less time into gameplay updates like Xin Zhao&#039;s or Azirs and a lot more into getting pre-season ready and then balanced once it&#039;s out. We&#039;ll get back to gameplay updates at around the same speed sometime early next year, but expect to see fewer of those for a bit. VGUs (the large updates) by contrast will keep going at their usual speed, given the folks working on those aren&#039;t generally involved too much ith pre-season.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Runes Feedback**\r\n\r\nNow that all the runes are on the website and people are getting a bunch of play on them on PBE we&#039;re poring through feedback about them. There are some things it would be particularly helpful to get people&#039;s thoughts on in addition to general feedback, including:\r\n\r\n* Whether it feels like specific champions have no choice of primary and/or secondary tree\r\n* Runes that you&#039;d always want to take, or never want to take\r\n* Runes where how they function isn&#039;t clear from the tooltip, or where there&#039;s information missing from the tooltip that&#039;s essential to making informed choices before the game starts\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Build a Rune page website**\r\n\r\nAs some of you may have noticed the rune page website doesn&#039;t reflect some of the recent changes to runes that are on PBE. We will be updating that website, but not as frequently as the PBE itself changes. Should see an update to it next week, and more regular ones following that, there&#039;ll be times where it&#039;s a bit out of date though and we&#039;re more focused on getting stuff into game and tested quick.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Balancing in 7.20 and 7.21**\r\n\r\nGenerally we&#039;ll be balancing champions and the game in general for the new Runes system much more than the old one. We&#039;ll hit anything that&#039;s massively out of line in the new system still, but we&#039;re focusing work on how things will be for the long term, rather than the 2-4 weeks any changes in those patch will have on Live before old runes/masteries are replaced and balance around them&#039;s no longer relevant. Evelynn&#039;s one of the champs most likely to be affected by that (might be temporarily stronger or weaker than she will be long term).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"The Deathsinger","date":"2017-09-29T16:55:13.477+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"A number of Karthus mains feel there's no keystone rune that benefits him.

Frankly they should function like conditioning be about 10 armor/mr and a 7.5% boost to a single resist.  Maybe get rid of the time limit on conditioning as well.\n* Revitalize feels odd in resolve.  If I'm soraka/sona/nami/janna I don't see many other options to even splash the tree.  I mean I guess I could go demolish, but that feels wrong on a passive support.\n* Inspiration smells like poo-poo compared to the other trees.\n* Waterwalking should be renamed Riverfighting\n* Nobody likes dark harvest\n* Eyeball collection seems win more\n* Gathering seems like it's going to be a win-more skill for hypercarries and a lose-less skill for champs who fall off because of poop-tier scaling.  Not really sure who it's for other than bronze.  I mean despite C9-Lyn going past the 60 minute mark, you know pro teams are never going to take this.  \n* Fleet Footwork is terrible.  Taste of blood should heal an ADC more and should be up nearly as often.  I really doubt fleet footwork will proc more than once in a teamfight or trade to be worth it as a keystone.\n* I feel like overheal should be a support rune that converts excess healing going out into a shield.\n* It'd be cool if there was a rune that converted 30% of a shield into a heal.\n* Triumph seems a little weak.  You only get the heal if you get a takedown but in laning if that happens, you are going to push the wave in and either take the tower or base.  In a teamfight, there's so much burst it doesn't feel like it'll help.  It's almost like it belongs on the tank tree where it'll do better.\n* Legend:bloodline is terrible because you won't get any lifesteal until you get a takedown.\n* In short all of the sustain options in precision are terrible.\n* The AS options on the other hand feel like they'll be too good.\n* Last stand feels more like a tank or juggernaut option as ADCs have lifesteal to stay above 80%.  Why is it here?  I don't see either class splashing precision for last stand/triumph.\n\nI'm wondering if riot went the wrong direction this preseason.  Considering all the complaints we've heard about how terrible this season is, I feel like this isn't a big enough improvement for 90% of the playerbase to warrant the work.  We know by the end of preseason there's going to be an optimal build for every champ, so it isn't like this'll fix that problem.  I also feel like more could have been done if riot overhauled the items and whatnot instead.  Maybe give a mid-sized rework to some of the problem champs.  \n\nI feel like that after the mymu, the assassin update, the support item update (mainly {{item:3301}} and perhaps {{item:3504}}), and the tank update that league overall is worse and it would have been a better use of time to correct the fallout of those things instead.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-29T17:56:04.565+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"* You're missing the point of Conditioning... It's not strictly better, precisely because there is a \"time limit\". And if you're against a hard match-up, this delay is the difference between giving an early kill or not. Either you take one resistance right now against your lane match-up, or you can survive without it and you get to have both, but later into the game.\n* Revitalize works for self-heal. Also, if you don't put it in Resolve, where else? As for something else to splash, Font of Life works well with most Enchantresses, except Sona (and even then, it works with her Ult, still better than nothing). Otherwise, Conditioning is never bad.\n* Inspiration is a matter of taste. I don't like it either, but I've seen people who swear by it on the boards.\n* Dark Harvest seems tricky to use effectively, but super powerful if you manage to do it. Once again, a matter of taste compared to the more reliable but less powerful Electrocute, but not an inherently bad Rune.\n* Agreed for Eyeball. On the other hand, the other options in that slot, especially Ghost Poro, are lose less options. You have to predict and bet how the game will play to get max value out of your Runes. So, I agree with you, but I don't see that as a problem.\n* Who cares about pro-team? In SoloQ, Gathering Storm will be pretty strong.\n* Fleet Footwork is obviously much more powerful. Yes, you will proc it more than once in a team-fight. How many procs of statik do you see in an average team-fight? Taste of Blood has a static 20s CD, so it will definitely proc less. It also has a better scaling, but a lower base value, so you need at least 150 Bonus AD to make it as good as Fleet Footwork for a single proc, and 150 AD is IE+Bloodthirster. Finally, Fleet Footwork gives MS, and that is not negligible at all.\n* Overheal would be a must pick on any healer if it worked that way. It wouldn't be a nice option, it would be something you would be forced to take, and all healers would be balanced around it. It's much better here.\n* More generally, this whole slot is about Sustain. Do you have easy access to pre-combat sustain? Versus do you want resets in team-fights (and yes triumph will help, it's an instant heal...)? Versus do you need mana?\n* A Rune that converts Shield into Heal: no, absolutely not. This is a terrible and super dangerous idea. The whole point of Shields is that you have to time them correctly, whereas you can just heal whenever. Jana or Karma would be super oppressive with that Rune.\n* Agreed that Legend: Bloodline will feel bad in early game.\n* Still, that doesn't make all sustain options terrible.\n* Juggernauts could totally Splash precision for Legend: Tenacity, Triumph, Last Stand, or even Coup de Grace. But more importantly, you under-estimate the amount of time ADC spend below 80% health.\n\n\n> We know by the end of preseason there's going to be an optimal build for every champ\n\nI very much doubt that.

All of which feeds in to the general feeling among smaller playerbases who are often more likely to have the champ reworked that Riot doesn’t care about them - along with skins and everything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-30T00:24:36.842+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is your concern that we don't only talk to mains or the way I'm describing our approach?","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-09-30T01:02:02.139+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would say it is more about the approach but that the vagueness in the description doesn’t help. The approach is unclear and the description doesn’t help explain things when you make a decision that negatively impacts a group.\n\nI think Riot plays lip service to the idea that some champs can have small, niche playerbases but then also goes out of the way to dramatically change thematics or kit in reworks because “the theme didn’t resonate with many players”, e.g. Yorick and Gallio. Only certain champs seem like they qualify for niche playerbases status in Riot’s eyes and the reasoning is not clear and seems capricious. \n\nSome times Riot seems to care more about what the mains think/want, some times it seems more about the people who could maybe be mains one day or pursuing an individual Rioter’s own conception of a champ regardless of all else.\n\nIt is cliche to say but if everyone’s opinion is deeply important, then no one’s is. Its an empty statement that gives little insight into why a decision is made or help players form expectations about how Riot will treat their main if they are to be reworked. It doesn’t serve as a very satisfactory explanation for a decision - when every group is important than there is always something that could justify just about any decision. In that case, it just feels like Riot is going to do what Riot wants.\n\nI don’t believe Riot pays enough attention to what mains think and want. The real negative of a main losing what they like about a champ should factor higher than the hypothetical player would could perhaps become a main.\n\nEDIT: Hopefully that was clear - I realize the ironic potential for being vague in my own response. I avoided using many specific champs, kits, and situations on purpose to avoid rabbitholes but can provide those examples if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2017-09-30T04:46:06.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found that most of the time when mains really love something about a champion and it gets reworked, it's because it was a really unhealthy gameplay pattern.

I'll try to outline the difficulties.\n\nPrecision is the usual primary tree for most marksmen, but Miss Fortune is less of a traditional crit carry than her peers. Precision has a ton of attack speed built into it and barely any %damage or flat AD (the only example of the latter being Press The Attack, which conflicts with her tendency to switch targets for Love Tap). This path provides her with relatively little benefit and is especially bad for Lethality MF.\n\nSorcery is one of the other choices for a primary damage path. Sorcery has some pretty cool options in the smaller runes, but all of the keystones perform terribly on her both in lane and out of it. Summon Aerie is weak and she can't use the shield aspect at all. Arcane Comet is incredibly unreliable with her more interactive Q-max laning phase, and her E-max laning phase is weak, boring, uninteractive, and still can't even make Comet land reliably. Phase Rush is probably the best option here, but her playstyle usually relies more on burst or good teamfight setup instead of brute-forcing people down in an extended chase. It mostly helps her kite better.\n\nThat leaves Domination, which probably has the best keystones options for her right now. Dark Harvest is a strong snowballing/scaling option and Electrocute gives more reliable early power. Predator is probably the worst of the three on her but still gives her a decent assassination option. However, the last two rune slots are lacklustre. Cheap Shot and Taste of Blood are decent options, but Cheap Shot can't really be used in lane without using E (same problems as Comet) or in a gank/all-in, where it offers little damage. Taste Of Blood is probably her best bet, but not as an aggressive option. However, Sudden Impact's Lethality being locked behind a dash/blink/stealth kind of feels insulting. Her fellow dashless Lethality marksmen (Varus, Jhin) both make better use of Precision as a primary path while Lucian can access Sudden Impact without burning Flash. The Bounty Hunter rune slot also offers her very little: all of her spellvamp-able spells are AoE (may be a bug since her Q is apparently supposed to proc spellvamp according the wiki, but doesn't heal her at all with this rune last I checked), she typically doesn't buy many impactful item actives (Youmuu's is probably the best use of Ingenious Hunter), and additional out-of-combat movespeed is weak because Strut already provides her with so much.\n\nResolve (rightfully) offers very little, and Inspiration is cool but relatively ineffective because her average autoattack range makes her a mediocre user of Hextech Freezeray, meaning it doesn't make up for the lack of damage in the rest of the path. Secondary trees tend to be fine because Sorcery, Precision, and even Inspiration all provide MF with some strong options without locking her into a subpar keystone. Anyway, that's enough about MF.\n\nGeneral rune impressions:\n\nFleet Footwork seems extremely weak. The change from %total AD with crit scaling (Warlord's) to low base values with terrible scaling in general is a perplexing choice in direction. Maybe I'm not seeing who this would be useful on, but with Press The Attack for AD toplaners and Lethal Tempo for marksmen, I don't know who else would even consider this. I'm tempted to say that Taste of Blood is almost as powerful as this keystone with its better early values, better scaling, and only slightly longer early cooldown.\n\nPresence of Mind obscures too much of its numbers even in the detailed tooltip. Mana return values would be appreciated.\n\nDark Harvest seems pretty strong, but I'd like to see some clarification of the fact that deaths of relevant units on both teams (e.g. allied champions and cannon minions) also grant souls. Not sure if this is intended, so I'm asking for either a bugfix or tooltip change to specify this behaviour since typically only enemy deaths grant rewards. If it's not intended, the numbers on soul scaling seem to be quite low.\n\nArcane Comet seems really unreliable if you don't have hard CC. Not sure how this can be fixed; maybe make it slightly faster so that slows are more reliable in making it hit? Also, it's a pretty boring keystone. Not much interaction for the user other than \"land your cc ability\" or \"land any ability and hope for the best\".\n\nCelerity's damage scaling seems weak. Even in extreme cases, 8% of bonus movement speed seems to have very little payoff in terms of offensive stats. Perhaps most of the power was intended to be in the 3% movespeed bonus? The fact that I wouldn't even consider this on MF seems a bit strange as a champion with 100 bonus movespeed in her kit.\n\nAbsolute Focus's tooltip is misleading. Last I checked, it did not scale linearly but instead gave something like a 5 AD buff at level 1, 7 AD at 6 and 11 and 16, and 2 AD at 18. I think smoothing out the curve is the simplest solution, but otherwise I'd like to see the tooltip reflect this. Not sure if Waterwalking follows the same pattern; didn't test that one.\n\nScorch also seems weak, particularly in late game. I recognize that this rune is probably not meant to be a late game rune, but its early impact is also somewhat negligible at the moment. I'd like to see its niche sharpened to focus on early game or to give it better scaling to compete with Waterwalking or Gathering Storm.\n\nWaterwalking is a cool concept but I wouldn't use it in practice. It feels like a rune I'd want to try and play around, but the bonus AD/AP values scale so slowly that it feels like a waste of time to do so. The movespeed for roaming feels most relevant, but 25 roaming movespeed in the same slot as Scorch and Gathering Storm feels lacklustre. I'd like to have it scale to its maximum value sometime in the midgame so that you get the most value out of it during dragon/herald fights, when you spend the most time in the river and to differentiate it from the late, late game scaling of Gathering Storm (and if it already scales like that, I'd like to see that in the tooltip).\n\nIn Resolve, Iron Shell and Mirror Shell are so weak that it doesn't feel like I'm making a major tradeoff for always taking Conditioning instead. I'd like to see the secondary effect on Iron Shell and Mirror Shell provide extra flat resistances instead of 5%.\n\nLastly, I didn't really like Kleptomancy as a concept. I don't think gold income is a \"cool\" effect, and the RNG aspect of item looting is highly undesirable.\n\nOther than that, I'm really liking the progress on runes. There's still a lot of improvements that can be made, but the overall direction is really cool and much better than old masteries. There are some sacrifices on certain niche builds on old runes, but I think that the gains are overall more than worth it.\n\nEDIT: I've been reading some of the other replies in this thread and and someone mentioned that there isn't a great keystone for DPS-focused spellcasters (Karthus, Kayn, Rumble, Malzahar, Fiddlesticks, and Singed being some examples of champions I've seen fitting this pattern). Seems pretty accurate to me since I've run into the same problem with MF though she's actually better off than most of those champions; there's nothing really similar to DFT in the new runes, which seems to have left a gap behind.","replies":[]}]}
