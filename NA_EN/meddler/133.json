Many of the changes won&#039;t be there until the 7.9 PBE cycle starts though. \r\n\r\nRight now the durability item changes are there, details can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/WgNuqAK8-midseason-durability-goals-and-direction\r\nhttps://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/8g2H4vjy-midseason-durability-feedback\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s also fairly likely we&#039;ll have some changes to support starting items there early next week as well. Those are focused on stuff like laning patterns (especially on Coin) and recognition of success. More details on that soon.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Renaming the support position?**\r\n\r\nAs some of you may have seen in game or from screenshots posted elsewhere we&#039;ve been conducting a few surveys recently to get players&#039;s thoughts on other possible names for the support position. We don&#039;t have any immediate plans to try and rename it, long term though, once we&#039;ve done more work on the gameplay possible from that position we&#039;d like to try and find a more appealing name than &#039;support&#039;. Something that still recognizes how important team interaction is, but that also doesn&#039;t imply a secondary, less empowered role. We&#039;d then be interested in changing the icon from something so ward like at the same time.\r\n\r\nHaven&#039;t found anything yet we&#039;re happy enough with, or that has gotten a strong positive response from players surveyed though. Words we&#039;ve been looking at so far include terms like multiplier, flex, catalyst and specialist. As above even if we found a good replacement name players liked we&#039;d also want to address gameplay issues first - renaming without doing so otherwise feels pretty empty/pointless. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Testing some spell buffering changes on PBE on Karthus and Ryze**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got a couple of changes to how Karthus and Ryze buffer their spells on PBE at present that are intended to make them a bit smoother to use, in particular on higher latency connections. Any feedback on those from folks with PBE access much appreciated. We&#039;re not mentioning specific details for now though on what&#039;s changed to see if there&#039;s anything good or bad that gets specifically noticed when you&#039;re not sure exactly what&#039;s changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kritty","date":"2017-04-07T17:56:56.638+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":5,"body":"I actually really like \"Specialist\", or something along those lines.

If you really think about it, the most fun supports right now (apart from Rakan and Thresh) are all mid lane mages that are now also being played bot. But the the actually champions that were designed to only be supports are mostly boring, which is why most people don't want to play support. Of course some people might find those supports fun too and be very offended that I called them boring, BUT, if they really were that fun then the whole problem with queue times due to the limited number of support players wouldn't exist and the other 80% or 90% of players wouldn't mind playing support, which isn't the case at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leyrann","date":"2017-04-09T06:29:43.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs more visibility.

As someone who also plays games Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm - Specialist, for me, refers to champions who are designed to perform non-PVP objectives. For me, Specialists are: Defense champions like Zyra, Heimerdinger and Illaoi; Poacher champions like Kalista, Cho'Gath and Nunu; and Demolitionist champions like Jinx, Tristana and Ziggs.\n\nIn my opinion:\n\n* Fighter\n * Enforcer (Vanguards and Divers - Sejuani, Vi, Leona, Amumu, Zac, Hecarim, Gragas, etc.)\n * Juggernaut (Juggernauts and Battlemages - Darius, Nasus, Olaf, Swain, Vladimir, Mordekaiser, Rumble, etc.)\n * Skirmisher (Yasuo, Jax, Xin Zhao, Irelia, Diana, Ekko, etc.)\n* Slayer\n * Artillery (Backline poke - Kog'Maw, Xerath and Varus.)\n * Bombardier (Frontline poke - Corki, Ezreal, Nidalee, etc.)\n * Mage (Burst casters - Annie, Veigar, Syndra, etc.)\n * Ranger (Marksmen / AP DPS - Ashe, Vayne, Cassiopeia, Azir, Twisted Fate, etc.)\n * Rogue (Assassins / Ambush champions - Evelynn, Katarina, Kha'Zix, Akali, etc.)\n* Support\n * Disruptor / Controller (Anivia, Blitzcrank, Lulu, Kennen, Morgana, Fiddlesticks, Orianna, etc.)\n * Enchanter (Janna, Soraka, Sona, Rakan and Zilean)\n * Warden (Protector Tanks - Braun, Alistar, Galio, Maokai, Thresh, etc.)\n* Specialist\n * Defense\n * Demo\n * Poacher\n\nAnd don't be afraid of Hybrids. \n\nIf you want to avoid the word \"Support\", just refer to champions as Disruptor, Enchanter or Warden. \"Our team needs a Warden.\" or \"Urgh, Enchanters are such boring champions - whenever they're good they just get nerfed.\" or \"I'm a Disruptor Main - I love pissing off my enemy!\".

They lack the outplay tools and short-ranged combat mobility thats so characteristic of the class.\n\nAlso,\nJuggernaut Aurelion Sol (don't get in melee range of him !!!)\n\nSorry to be a dick btw. Classifying things like this in League appeals to me as a lifetime RPG player, and so when someone is at odds with my ideas I try to defend them :P mostly I like Riot's except for their classification of Ekko as a Skirmisher - I consider him an Assassin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2017-04-08T01:25:19.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just name them what they are....Redemption-bots.

Adaptive Helm by itself takes a massive dump on DPS/Combo based mages, Banshee's will be a 1st/2nd item pick up. Items like Spirit/Maw/Edge can already screw up a mage's function as a burster and now with this alot of them will fall even further into darkness, unless they have some form of in-built utility. \n\nAnd this not withstanding the massive AP drain from items that has been going on since mid season 5, now you are giving MR per level for everyone? The only effect this will have is that AP characters will become a liability and will get phased out completely, which in turn will cause AD characters to take their place, which in turn will cause tanks to completely shift to anti physical defense and we'll return to initial issue: tanks being too strong against damage dealers (of the primarily physical kind).\n\nOn the other hand {{item:3116}} this is completely gutted, this {{item:3285}} has no identity, these {{item:3027}} {{item:3003}} fail completely on their jobs as scaling items due to either providing a low end payoff for their scaling curve, or being too slow to reach their peak. {{item:3089}} is an overpriced mess with an equally crap build path, and we were promised new endgame buildpaths from {{item:3802}} when the mage rework came out in the first place. {{item:3151}} is niche as hell, but because everything else is gutted, it stands out as the better option in broken down armory. Used to be, with a double scaling build you could reach 1k AP and around 750-800 with one scaling item. Now you get what? 800-850 at best? And even with a scaling item like {{item:3027}}, you can't even break 700 AP without consumables. And note that double scaling builds were not that common and had plenty counterplay due how slow their spikes were and how weak the champions that went with single/double scaling builds were in the early/mid-game.\n\nYou mentioned that {{champion:38}} wasn't providing the lategame payoff he should for how weak his laning was in the recent patch notes. Maybe the fact that two of his core items ({{item:3027}} {{item:3157}}) lost a decent amount of AP value and Kassa is one of the most AP dependant champions in the game due to low bases and large scalings.\n\nHave you guys considered that maybe, _just maybe_ you should consider making a infusion of AP back into the game and take another look at the AP armory (specifically passives and actives) if these changes do go through?\n\nEDIT: Then there's the Hextech armory of which two are pretty niche {{item:3146}} {{item:3152}}, though fun and interesting items and the other {{item:3030}} either gets outdone stat-wise with {{item:3027}}  or get overlapped with {{item:3116}} and it _still_  gets the short end of the stick.","replies":[{"poster":"Lebłanc Bot","date":"2017-04-09T01:09:04.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah really most so items need to be rework.

Their items can be played by almost anyone with similar efficiency.\n\nAs a 50/50 support/mage player, i feel like the move you made all the way back to the introduction of AP/Armor/MR/HP scalings on the CC/Shields/Heals of supports was a move in the right direction. I think you should keep going that way. Make supports scale in CC/Shields/Heals like tanks scale in tankyness and damage champions scale in damage. Make Nami's bubble duration or size scale with AP. Leona's passive scale with health or armor/mr. Soraka's movement bonus passive with AP. Supports should be picked for the specific way each support can empower their team, and currently things like Annie/MF/Malz supp exist because what true support champions bring to their team isn't as valuable as raw damage.\n\nI feel like Supports, instead of getting per-level scaling on their items (looking at Redemption and Locket), should get item power values equal to other classes for equal prices. In exchange, the effects on these items need to be unstackable, and be designed around either weakening the enemy team or empowering your own. Auras, on-hit effects, crowd-control/defense/offense dampener/enhancer actives. There are ways. In return, also bring back some extra Tenacity for other classes.\n\nThe fact that Supports get lower income than other classes can be somewhat remedied in the Mastery expansion you guys have planned, letting supports gain gold by doing support things.
