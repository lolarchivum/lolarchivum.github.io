The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up:\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**State of work on a few champs**\r\n\r\nNot much new that's ready to talk about this week. Going to do some quick run throughs on current plans for a few small champ updates as a result.  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Teemo**\r\n\r\nTeemo changes have been on the PBE for a while now and we've also recently got some on site user lab testing done on them. Seeing some positive sentiment and some concerns. Plan is to try another iteration as a result, with a particular focus on improving the E, then reassess overall state of the project.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Aatrox**\r\n\r\nAatrox changes have been live for a bit now. So far we're still cautiously optimistic about them, with the revive no longer being reliably available showing particular promise. Looks a little strong in high MMR play, not planning on nerfs in 9.11 at least though. Very interested to see if changes have addressed some of what made him so pick/ban in pro, even when weak elsewhere, and should see pro play on them shortly.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Yuumi**\r\n\r\nWe're starting to see Yuumi succeed quite well for people who've played her a lot. Player sentiment's also shifted from a clear consensus she's weak (pre hotfix) to a wide range of opinions from too weak to balanced to too strong. Holding off on any changes beyond some low power impacting useability stuff and bug fixes in 9.11 as a result. Trying to be cautious about not buffing needlessly if we can help it, given that would force future nerfs.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Diana**\r\n\r\nAs with Teemo we've had some Diana changes on the PBE for a bit. Feedback on those has generally been on the more negative side. We do think they accomplish some of our goals with the project, but aren't confident about the overall package landing in a good spot. Plan is to cut a lot of the changes as a result. Likely means we ship some small adjustments now and then consider Diana for further work sometime a bit later in the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotMeddler","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-05-24T15:08:43.752+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":1,"body":"Semi-unrelated, but:\n\n Any chance you guys will ever acknowledge Shen's bugged interaction with Hail of Blades?

Shen is a champion who needs all the help he can get in lane and fixing this could open up new playstyles or builds. \n\n At the very least, it would make Shen more fun to play and I feel that's something he desperately needs right now.

When he's been successful it's been in ways that leave his opponents with few ways to interact well enough with him in lane or later. Not expecting this current nerf will do anything other than band aid things a little. Wouldn't want to sink a lot of time into Jayce either though until other champs in significantly greater need of work get help first.\n\nSylas wise we believe wave clear to be a good angle to hit.

Most of us favor a revert, but the ult currently on PBE is different than his original one. The knockback on his PBE ult is next to nothing, while his old knockback used to be significant. Utilizing the knockback was what separated the good Zacs from the bad ones. Back when he was reworked, the reasoning behind changing it was because it was a \"chaotic Wukong ultimate\". What is currently on the PBE is basically the same thing as Wukong ult, while his old ult was very different. The original ult was all about positioning it correctly and timing bounces to knock the right people in the correct directions. For some reason, those reverting Zac have decided to take that away from him. Also, his PBE ultimate uses the same blob spawning rules as his Scoop one. It is supposed to be one blob for each bounces on a champion, but now it is blobs equal to the amount of champions hit with the first bounce. The blobs also are supposed to spawn in between him and the champion hit when ulting, which doesn't happen. The worst part is we don't even know if it is on purpose or a bug that hasn't been fixed because we have had zero feedback. \nAlso, he is never going to be balanced or fun to play with his current Q because it is such a powerful ability that the rest of his kit had to be nerfed. It's a cool ability, but it doesn't fit Zac's playstyle at all. His reworked Q and ult both destroyed what Zac was as a champ. He was all about moving around the teamfight, picking up blobs and throwing out low cooldown abilities. Now he doesn't have the freedom to move around because his Q is so clunky. It would be like giving Singed new Zac Q. Would it be a good ability and a buff to the champion? Of course. Would it destroy what the champion is all about? Absolutely. The ability does not belong on Zac and older Zac players will not be satisfied with it being a part of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"69mememaster","date":"2019-05-26T21:40:22.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this dude knows his zac","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galactic Mayhem","date":"2019-05-24T15:30:13.127+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Anything regarding akali?\nShe just keeps getting nerfed cause of pro play and you guys don't even bother justifying it anymore","replies":[{"poster":"PhilTheTrill81","date":"2019-05-25T00:31:14.014+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali is not weak by any means.

So, I'd rather share some insights on Swains game play today rather than ask for straight buffs.  I made a post about Swains visuals in the past so I'm just going to stick to the game play side only.\n\nRight now I would say the rework is actually good in that it has cohesion and at least somewhat similar game play to the original, although it lacks at least one other DOT in the kit to synergize with the ult.  He would have better item strength if he did have another DoT to match with the typical Liandry + Rylai combo, but other than that the new kit is done fairly well and has a nice thematic of armored sorcerer chucking lightning.\n\nHowever, Swains play rate is extremely low right now.  I think that's because (as someone who has played the champion a lot myself) he just isn't that satisfying to use. There is no, \"Gotcha!\" moment with Swain.  Even hitting his full combo often doesn't feel very rewarding.  He also has some minor things which make him awkward to use.\n\nSome things that could make the champion feel better to play:\n\n1.  Slightly increase his attack speed.  His new auto attack animation is better than old Swains notoriously awful one, but his attack speed is slightly too low to make use of it properly.  There is often a long pause during the wind up which I think could be easily fixed by a slight attack speed increase (probably around 5%).  Unless it was an intentional inclusion, that wind up time makes it harder to farm and harder to get in harass during the laning phase.\n\n2.  Let Swain move while casting Q.  I understand this would make him better at kiting, but it would also help him against extremely mobile enemies.  Kiting out a difficult mobile enemy while moving and casting Q is what Swain SHOULD be doing.  He's already immobile so increasing that during casting only makes it worse.\n\n3.  On the ultimate it would better to do something extra with souls and remove Demon Flare all together.  For the amount of cool down on the ultimate I would rather that it be stronger DoT and heal and simply remove the flare portion.  Without flare being part of the power budget can also let it drain from 5 targets.  Remember Swains fantasy as a champion is to pop the ultimate and wade into battle and attempt to penta the enemy team while in the thick of the fight.  Having his ultimate purposely set to only 3 targets vs his original 5 actively limits you from being able to do that.\n\n4.  Let the Q always pierce through the first target it hits and then only continue to a third target if that target dies.  It would make him better at trading in lane, particularly against healing/shielding enemy mid laners who stand in the minion wave (like Sylas or Yasuo).  Right now a single melee minion can eat an entire Q.  Lissandra already can do this with her Q and hers slows on top of it.  Swain is only going to get max damage if he is standing right next to the enemy he is using Q on to get all the bolts.  If he is using it to pierce minions at a range he wont be getting full damage on it anyways.\n\nEven if his overall power has to be lowered to make some of the above changes it would make him feel much better and more satisfying to play.  I think his current power is about right.  He just needs some adjustments to make the champion smoother when played.  Most of the comments I've read about the champion seem to have the same consensus that Swain is reasonably strong, but suffers from a really bad laning phase that could be helped with the above suggestions, and that he doesn't feel all that satisfying to play due to having no \"high moment\" where everything comes together.\n\nThank you for reading.  Keep in mind the above are just suggestions and could use only one of them or all of them as needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Aether Chronos","date":"2019-05-26T12:38:37.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an OTP, i think he needs some tweaks, at least to make his gameplay more satisfactory.\nFrom my point of view he has 3 things to have in mind for make changes in his kit:\n\n* 1st (comeback chances): I know Swain is a champ who can make easily 1 vs 9 if he's enough ahead, but the problem is that the game punishes him too much when enemies get advantage (an advantage that not always is because the skill difference between both players, like thoose times you're getting camped hard).\nI understand there is necesary some ways to punish you for loosing lane, but his main problem right now is that the punishment is far way bigger than the reward for winning lane.\nFor make that impact that is supossed you have to do (and that justifies the slow way to scale if you're behind), you need a HUGE gold advantage, meanwhile if enemy kills you 2 or 3 times in lane you're nearly out of the game (at least if you dont have a team who is stomping).\n\nThis is the most unsatisfactory part of the champ, but it would be easy to solve if riot would fix the next problems that comes from this first one.\nAnd the reason is that thoose problems make swain a really manichean champion, because you can be a monster yeah, but you also can be useless if you're behind :c\n---------------------------------\n* 2nd (Waveclear): In this point the problematic concept is the \"death's hand\" [Q]. That skill is really nice and works more than propperly when you're even or ahead, but the problem comes when you're behind.\nIf you're behind means you're scaling extremely low, and the problem is that this skill has a really low basic dmg and scaling per bolt.\nIn addition, the lighning bolts never pass tru enemies or minions if they dont kill them, so... considering swain is not a mage who builds tons of ap... it gives you a lot of problems to CS propperly when you're behind.\n\nAnd this is not the only problem, because less waveclear in Swain's case means less push capacity, and that problem is even bigger considering he's really awfull farming under turret.\nIn other words, he just hasnt got waveclear when he's behind.\n\nConsider that Swain's CS has been really low from this season, and this is because now minions max HP scale too hard for him, so this problem has been even harder this season.\n---------------------\n* 3rd (his healing): This pont is similar to the last, because its affected by the same concept.\nSwain has the worst healing capacity from the \"self-healers\" nothing to do against champions like Rhaast, Vladimir, Fiddlestics, etc.\nBy the other hand, that point is understable, because even having the lowest self-healing capacity i have to say its one of the most effectives, considering you get it just when you need it (fighting).\n.\nThe problem comes that (again), this is wonderfull when you're ahead... but its truly awfull when you're behind... (and btw, its just inssuficent when you're even if enemies takes grievous hounds).\n.\nThis come from 2 sides (his passive, that scales per max hp and his R that scales per 16% x 3).\n----------------------------\n* 4th (his damage): Im not gonna say swain has no damage, because that's just not true, but the problem is that (again) when you're behind you are same as a minion.\nAn example of this feeling comes when you're playing with the \"Tyrant Skin\" and you feel you can destroy everyone when you're ahead... but when you're behind you feel like you were unable to do nothing.\n--------------------------------------\n* 5th (his combos): The problem of Swain's combos are the core skill for them (his [E]). Nevermove just pass tru enemies at the begining, but then explodes to the first unit it impacts...\nThe problem? simple, the skillshot is extremely slow, so its easy to dodge, if the skill would be easier to hit, it wouldnt be so easy for the enemies to get you out of the game with some ganks.\n\n..............................................\n..............................................\n\nSolutions? Simple:\n\n* [Passive]: Adding a new effect to the current (i think in one of thoose options):\n1---- Giving swain a (%) of his damage dealt as healing (similar to the taste of blood or aatrox passive).\n2--- Increasing max hp restored if you're low hp (for instance \"swain heals 5% up to 20% per soul depending of his hp lost)\nWith this swain would have enough sustain to fight if he's behind, and he wouldnt be inmortal if he has some kills.\n.\n* [Q): First of all, you need to do the lighning bolts pass tru objetives (at least with minions), and second, i propose this change to the way the bolts are stacked:\nyou get the max damage stacking 3 bolts, and the rest restores mana (flat).\nWith this you would fix the main swain problem and you would give him enough mana sustain. In addition his main skill to do damage would be easier to use (hitting 3 bolts makes you being at melee range and that's just impossible when you're not ahead).\n.\n[W]: The only thing i would say is to have less casting time or less dmg reduction for minions, but i admit this is secondary.\n.\n[E]: You need to do one of this changes:\n1----The skillshot can ALWAYS pass tru units, and just explodes with champions (in this case keeping his current speed).\n2--- The skillshot is far way faster (in this case keeping the explosion with the first unit impacted).\nWith this swain would be less situational, and you could make the game experience easier and more satisfactory. Even more, in the first option i would even acept a nerf to the damage.\n.\n[R]: Needs more healing, and less healing reduction with minions (swain is a champion who is usually camped, and sometimes is hard to deal 2 vs 1 because of this). In addition his ultimate has too much cd (2 mins is excesive for what it does at the begining). In addition, that 0.5 scs delay its just stupid, considering you've removed it from all similar ultimates like nasus or renekton.\nAnd... there is the main problem... the souls... Souls are really hard to get when you're behind... so you can imagine what i'm going to say...\n\nI propose to make this changes:\n1--- Healing is bigger (from 16%ap per unit to 25% per unit) + (reduced healing for non-champion units from 3.2%AP per unit to 10%)\n2--- Instant cast (same as nasus or renekton).\n3--- You dont need a soul to use the \"demonic ascension\", but until you have at least a soul you will deal 30% dmg of THIS skill, incluiding the demonflare).\n4--- Less CD for the ultimate (at least 90 seconds, 120 seconds is too much for real :c )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2019-05-24T15:13:43.747+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any new info about Ryze?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-24T15:27:25.743+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've got some changes in testing, aimed at making his skill floor friendlier in large part.

Q is weaker, but empowers passive. R is weaker, but empowers passive. E is a mess, but gives you an AS buff that will empower passive. W is still irrelevant to everyone's dismay.\n\nTL;DR - The passive is really strong, but the cost to his overall power makes on-hit seem like the only viable strat. Q nerf means he can't assassinate well. W sucks. E shouldn't have an inbuilt detriment like a slow or footprints or any damage reveals, but if there must be such a mechanic put it on W as a double edged sword. R bouncing shrooms is a joke. 5 shroom cap is a placebo; give us a lower recharge or longer duration.\n\n\n**Breaking it down**\n---------------\n**Passive:** Poison on passive is nice if solely for the fact it gives me flexibility in ranking other spells.  Gaining poison damage with levels is certainly nice, and there is no denying that the 50% amp is really strong. To the point that I fear it crowds out his power budget, forcing his other spells to be weak to the point that only On-Hit builds still work. Th passive has more base damage at later levels, and the instant On-Hit also has a lower AP ratio so that doesn't help AP or Assassin builds.\n\n-----------------------\n\n**Q:** Lower base, particularly at higher ranks, and 20% less AP means this is a significantly weaker burst tool. The burst this spell offered is largely what made Teemo capable of assassinating targets from stealth. \n\nCoupled with the inconsistency of the blind debuff leave this spell still feeling lackluster. For example, Ekko's E still applies passive and damage if he is blinded. I believe there are other on-hit effects that still apply during blind, and empowered auto's are not consumed during blind which really sucks. Basically this will slightly reduce incoming damage for a brief duration, but more importantly will empower your passive - again all about On-Hit.\n\n-----------------------\n\n**W:** This spell is still lame. There is no scaling, there aren't any additional effects, it's really just boring. One thing that the rework has repeatedly been trying to do is find ways to make Teemo's stealth weaker. I disagree with this approach, as I'll get into next, but if it's non-negotiable then tie the detriment to W. If Teemo casts W while invisible he leaves behind toxic footprints in his haste. The footprints will give a clear indicator of Teemo's whereabouts, but allow him to travel faster. The footprints can either apply a some form of debuff/small DoT, or even just mark the target as \"poisoned\" for the effect of his passive.\n\n---------------------------\n\n**E:** Obviously this is the most contentious spell, since it's the biggest change, and there are similar spells to look at for comparison. Namely Twitch Q.\n\nFirst looking at current numbers involved. Teemo can move 700/750/800/850/900 units. Base movespeed translates to 2.12/2.27/2.42/2.58/2.73 seconds of travel. More movespeed (like W) will reduce that duration. He gains 25% vision radius. He gains 20/30/40/50/60% AS for 3 seconds. CD is 40/37/34/31/28s - reduced while in bush.\n\nTwitch's Q lasts 10/11/12/13/14 seconds and grants 10/30% movespeed, which would equate to 3630/3993/4356/4719/5082 units of travel. More than 5 times the range at all ranks. Notably, it's camo, not invis, but Twitch doesn't want to be within the 500 units needed to see him, so that doesn't really upset him much. Twitch gains 30/35/40/45/50% AS, so more early less late than Teemo, but his lasts 5 seconds instead of 3. Twitch Q also gets a hard reset if someone dies while poisoned, and it's otherwise on a flat 16 second cooldown.\n\nTaking all of this in, I think it's pretty easier to argue that Twitch Q far surpasses the currently proposed Teemo E. It lasts longer, has a stronger steroid early that allows for easier snowballing, has a more powerful reset, and provides MS during the stealth. One of the two main uses of Teemo's stealth (and Twitch's) is to surprise an enemy and assassinate them. Twitch has more burst than Teemo, more range than Teemo, and more AoE damage than Teemo (Twitch always gets Hurricane, and uses it better than Teemo can), and his stealth tool, at least so far as I see it, is stronger than Teemo's.\n\nDespite all of this, you are adamant about Teemo having some additional detriment to his stealth. I think this is ridiculous, but if it's the only way for this to work, then as in my above point, tie it to his W. Give the Teemo player the choice between \"true\" stealth, or \"rushed\" stealth. If he chooses to use move quick while invisible he gives away information about his location, but the opponent then needs to decide if they want to chase him. While we're at it give, either make E duration based, or distance with a MS ratio; it's pathetic right now.\n\n--------------------\n\n**R:** I swear to god if \"infinite bouncing mushrooms\" is taking up a non-zero amount of Teemo's power budget I will scream. This is the stupidest addition I've ever seen. I hate it more than I despise Dunkmaster Ivern, which I thought I hated with every fiber of my being until I saw this. THE ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER USED THIS WAS IN A MOCK ATTEMPT TO \"STEAL\" OVER BARON WALL. It's a joke in lane. It's a joke in teamfights. It's a joke when split pushing. And frankly, it's a joke when trying to steal an objective. You would be more likely to succeed a steal by using the blast cone and casting Q; bonus points for using A>Q>A, which would be more damage than the full duration of the mushroom!  Instead of forcing me to use two shrooms to \"safely\" get a mushroom in a bush I know is being camped, give me more than a 400 unit range at rank 1! Almost every dash/blink/ranged CC outperforms 400 units!\n\nFor the rest of it: I get that the general community sentiment is that shrooms are obnoxious. I also get that if you build a tiny bit of MR and actually make use of sweepers and pinks then they aren't a problem. If the bottom line is that the Teemo player must be held accountable for the failings of ADCs everywhere  and shroom damage needs to be nerfed then so be it. But for all that is good give me some real compensation instead of \"4/5 shroom cap at levels 11/16\". Give me a lower recharge time! If they hurt so much less let me have more of them! That's that goal of increasing the cap, but the problem is the only time Teemo actually hits the 3 shroom cap is if he dies, if he recalls with 2/3 shrooms, or if he's not playing well! AT ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM this increases total shroom threshold by 2. You could accomplish the same by reducing the recharge by a tiny amount, or extending the duration by 30 seconds even!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flavi Kang","date":"2019-05-24T18:15:57.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember you saying on the previous post that Yi is weaker in all MMRs after 9.10.

Id like to see the max rank knock up finally added back to it concidering its super easy to predict dodge it, which gives it more of a zone control aspect when she has something held with W and its maxed out. Could also see the mana cost being reduced to like 80 at max rank because an ultimate level mana cost for a spell thats VERY difficult to land is kinda upsurd.
