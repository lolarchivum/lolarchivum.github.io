The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n**Ahri**\r\n\r\nWanted to follow up on a couple of champs that have been asked about a lot recently who we haven&#039;t talked about for a while. First up is Ahri. We&#039;ll be reassessing AP champs in general after the 8.4 item changes go out, our current thoughts assuming nothing major changes with her though are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* She&#039;s around the right spot in terms of power. \r\n\r\n* She&#039;s somewhat unsatisfying. Some of that&#039;s that her W isn&#039;t the most engaging spell. We think the bigger issue though is that her effect on the game is too flat relative to how she&#039;s performing. An ahead Ahri often struggles to convert even a significant lead into a large enough advantage for her team (an issue some assassins have as well). A behind Ahri is safe enough to still do fairly well and not screw things up too much for her team. Her highs should arguably be higher and her lows lower.\r\n\r\n* We&#039;re tentatively planning on looking at her somewhere in the 8.5-8.7 range. Beyond at least roughly power neutral and sharpening difference between good and poor performances we don&#039;t know what that&#039;s likely to look like yet. Things like reassessing the speed boost on Q would certainly be on the table, don&#039;t want to make any promises yet though.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n**Quinn**\r\n\r\nSecond up, is Quinn. Our current thinking:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Quinn&#039;s got a pretty strong thematic starting point (Demacian ranger/scout with trained bird).\r\n* We&#039;ve never delivered well on that, both from a thematic perspective or a gameplay perspective.  \r\n* A consistent issue with Quinn, regardless of which patch you consider, has been her dependence on lane bullying melee and bursting squishies. She lacks late game (team fight especially) ability to contribute, with some of the gameplay problems that plague some assassins (hard to close out games/make team contributions) and some of the problems some marksmen exhibit (anti melee laning pattern in particular).\r\n* Player desire for her seems to be split between &#039;make her a more typical marksmen so she can bot lane&#039; and &#039;keep her as a non bot laner&#039;\r\n* Her original ult was very stat checky, giving extra power (most applicable in 1v1s or small fights) without giving her ways to survive in larger fights that aren&#039;t just &#039;kill quickly&#039;. For some players at least also some thematic failure (why am I turning into a bird?)\r\n* Her current ult&#039;s generally pretty unsatisfying for many (all I get&#039;s out of combat movement?), also failing thematically for a lot of players too (my bird&#039;s just a taxi?)\r\n* My personal belief is that any significant work on Quinn needs to include making her a more functional team fighter and in exchange wean her somewhat off her laning pattern that leaves opponents she&#039;s good against without much ability to respond. Not necessarily shift her to being a standard marksman, or even a good team fighter, but less skewed than at present. That&#039;s likely a larger task, I&#039;m doubtful we get a meaningful improvement from smaller scope work though. \r\n* We&#039;re certainly not opposed to doing some work on Quinn. Unlike Rengar or LeBlanc for example though we don&#039;t believe this is a case where the previous version was any better, so a reversion doesn&#039;t solve things. Not sure at present on likely timing of any work. Apologies for such an open ended &#039;it&#039;s needed, but don&#039;t know when&#039;, don&#039;t want to make even a vague implied promise that might not be delivered on here though. I&#039;d imagine for players interested in Quinn that likely feels poor, especially given just talked above about looking at Ahri who&#039;s already in a better state.  The size of work involved is much larger though, so I&#039;m not confident making any predictions until we&rsquo;ve both put aside time for such work and know what at least the rough direction looks like. \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n**Action in Pro Play**\r\n\r\nOne of the things we&#039;re putting some focus on right now, both for 8.4 and 8.5, is the lack of action in pro games. In regular games we&#039;ve seen bloodiness stay high post pre-season, with game times a little shorter as well until we buffed early tower defenses. Pro by contrast has trended (some exceptions) towards pretty slow, safe games, with teams either having difficulty closing out or being hesitant about taking the risks needed to do so. Having some pro games like that&#039;s fine of course, when it&#039;s common though would argue it&#039;s a much less enjoyable experience as a spectator. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 8.4 (some of these are late additions to the patch):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Likely removing Tracker&#039;s Knife from the jungle items. It&#039;s become increasingly dominant as a jungle choice in pro play specifically, with the extra vision making jungler position especially more predictable. \r\n\r\n*  Increasing the power of Epic monster buffs so that you really want to contest them if possible. Baron buff at present only scales in power from 20-27 minutes, we&#039;ll be changing it to scale all the way up to around 50 minutes, making it much more meaningful later game. Also doing a few other tweaks to it at the same time (making Baron empowered cannon minions more meaningful damage wise, shifting to a more appropriate AD/AP ratio rather than favoring AD etc).\r\n\r\n* Elder Dragon isn&#039;t changing on the first spawn. Subsequent takes though will now get significantly empowered by previous Elder dragon kills. Taking two Elder Dragons in a row will offer substantial extra power for that extended objective control (also shortening the respawn timer a bit to make that a bit more feasible).\r\n\r\n* Delaying the time Stopwatch becomes available to use further, most likely to 8 minutes, from the current 6. That gives a window where champs generally have their ults but Stopwatches haven&#039;t come online yet.  We think Stopwatch is likely getting blame for slow play in a lot of cases where there are other issues as well or instead. It&#039;s certainly contributing though still, even with recent changes, and it&#039;s the sort of effect that should be much less common to avoid warping games too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things for post 8.4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Looking at early game sustain, and which sources may be out of line still making it hard to have damage stick (Relic Shield and Runes likely starting points)\r\n\r\n* Looking at Zombie Ward, and amount of vision it&#039;s adding\r\n\r\n* Looking at TP, and chilling effect it has on the game in many cases, both in pro and regular play. Things like how it makes it harder to fight and meaningfully win in top lane, increases risk of aggressive play in bot (don&#039;t so you don&#039;t get TP flanked), leads to periods of &#039;wait until TP is up before trying anything late game etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Fajerk","date":"2018-02-14T16:30:39.355+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"Any words on Marksman balance and their itemization in near future?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-14T16:56:12.512+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"I was planning to talk about marksmen play patterns this week since that was a fairly requested topic last week.

I think you hit most of the points on the head and we know it's bound to require larger work to get right. However, we'd still like to play the champ to some degree of success so maybe some QoL changes could be suggested.\n\nOne that's been floating around is giving Quinn the ability to walk while channeling her ultimate. Having to root yourself is pretty crippling, and having that siege minion switch aggro to you to cancel it is the worst especially at level 6 where it eats about 1/3 of her mana.\n\nAlso her Skystrike bug that's been happening since October should be looked at eventually. The damage never goes off out of her ugly when you Vault.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-14T17:02:31.235+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, let me check with some folks about being able to channel ult while moving.

Honestly I think the largest problem with her ult is entirely thematic. Valor as a taxi just doesn’t make sense. He’s a hawk, and in all other appearances he’s normal sized yet suddenly he’s carrying Quinn? It doesn’t make sense, and it looks super goofy. I’m gonna echo another poster and say that if they maintained the exact same functionality, but used the old animation of Quinn and valor swapping out, (but still with solely a movespeed boost), that would be an incredibly satisfying change. Would that be relatively simple since the animations already exist?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roigaar","date":"2018-02-14T18:52:45.013+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for commenting on Quinn.\n\nI have to point out, while I agree with the things you're saying regarding her current state, some of her historic problems and outlook, I don't think you touched enough on her current power level. I don't think Quinn's current problem is that she's underpowered per se, but she's certainly underperforming. Check the relation between playrates and winrates for the last few months: she used to have a stable, slightly below average playrate and a good winrate that befit her status as a niche champion. Regardless of the logic we use (I saw some objections to my previous take on the matter) I think it's undeniable that a champion that rapidly loses both winrate (3% overall in two months) and playrate (sub 1% now) with no direct changes is under duress. Quinn has always had to compete against champions similar to those in meta, across many different metas in fact, while having the same stable numbers she hasn't shown ever since the preseason, specifically since the lethality item nerfs.\n\nI agree, Quinn players tend to be divided over what they want for Quinn, even though Repertoir was very explicit this version of Quinn was designed to be a solo laner, a facet that Volty wholeheartedly embraced, but I feel like that's a conversation to be had in the future once her rework looms. For *now* I think it'd be a disservice to simply say these things and not move to improve Quinn's current state, because she's not in immediate rework priority, which, you know better than I do, means that it'll be nearer to two years before you guys can address her.\n\nReturning to my original point, I don't think Quinn is underpowered. I think we'd be insincere to say that she needs a return to former states because there's very good reasons why you guys moved to nerf what you did. But this is a perfect opportunity to move to improve Quinn's feel at the very least, and I do believe there is room given how she's performing to add at least a tad of power **as long as it doesn't contribute to alienate melees**.\n\nWe would really like for Repertoir to evaluate Quinn's state, for two reasons: one, he stated that he would procure that Quinn was always at least somewhat relevant. Two, a year ago said he knew that Quinn's kit has a few pain points he would like to address but Quinn's state at the time did not allow for him to do so on good conscience. I think Quinn can be said to be objectively under the relevance bar, and for the first time since the rework she exhibits room for work.\n\nAs for ideas for places you can add power without contributing to abusive patterns, I suggest:\n\n* First and foremost, fixing some of her bugs. Currently, there are situations in which Skystrike doesn't fire at all, or fires and deals no damage. A bug that was fixed previously has come back, too: if you cancel Harrier's auto, you can no longer proc the mark on that target.\n\n* Disallowing creep damage to cancel her ult channel. A 2 second self root is deterrent enough for quick escapes, and it ends up feeling awful to have a single creep auto cancel a nearly complete channel due to erratic creep behavior.\n\n* Easing on the slow inflicted by creep aggro when using her ultimate. Currently, Quinn is massively slowed if she takes creep damage during her ultimate. This mechanic often feels overbearing because she isn't merely slowed by a percentage, her movement speed is set to her base, negating any bonus her ult might have given. The change is extraordinarily jarring, there is no easing into it. We dread it so much we call creep autos during ult \"minion glitterlances\".\n\n* Improving W's active. This ability feels very lackluster compared to similar vision tools. The cooldown is way too high for a point blank ability, vision doesn't linger long enough to justify said cooldown and it feel like it's overall the place in Quinn's kit where the least power is allocated.\n\n* Make Skystrike deal additional damage to creeps or execute creeps at a certain threshold. One consequence of the nerf to Vault out of ult was that Skystrike lost its usefulness as a pushing mechanic because it deals negligible damage to creeps. I am not exaggerating when i say that Skystrike contributes far more to ruining your ability to CS when pushing than aiding it. It feels awful.\n\n* If you're amenable to bumping up Quinn's power levels, simply increasing W's passive uptime slightly would go a long way in bolstering healthy combat patterns. The buff duration often creates pain points where the sudden change in attack speed induces mistakes, and part of it is lost simply adjusting for the shift. R's mana costs early are also a huge pain point, which puts a heavy damper on what Quinn can hope to accomplish with it during the part of the game where she's supposed to be strong. It scales to cost 0, which trivializes her mana costs late. I think she would benefit a lot from a flat cost.\n\nSummarizing, I commend you for addressing Quinn, but please don't allow her to stay in this state indefinitely. We beg of you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2018-02-14T17:10:54.011+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a common quinn player, but at least on a thematic level, having her bird visible all of the time might make the parts of her kit that interact with it more apparent. She actually uses Valor quite a lot, but the longest they stay on screen is when it's being a taxi. I imagine that would be a lot of animation work, which might not pay off short-term, but if you're thinking of larger work it might be something to consider.

You don't have to bring Valor's melee abilities back, you don't have to change the damage to what it used to be. But having Valor actually carry Quinn still feels incredibly derpy and clunky, even 2 years after the rework. Just have Quinn and Valor swap places when the ability's cast (or the channel's completed) and when you break the ult (by entering combat or whatever) just have Valor fly back up to the sky.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tern","date":"2018-02-14T17:18:17.444+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using any other ability than actually pressing R to cast Skystrike there is a good chance it just wont go off at all.

I think the potential early AA range nerf and nerfing the early Q CD refund without touching the late game refund would make more sense.  Also, why was the nerf to Frozen Mallet reverted?

I know work on her is quite far off and it’s hard to gauge what direction you guys will take, so I’m not expecting any promises, but do you think there’s at least enough people who enjoy playing Quinn as an assassin that it could jusify the possibility of taking her in that direction (similar to how old Urgot was played mostly as a top laner, so he was reworked into a top lane juggernaut)? \n\nJust to be clear, I’m not opposed to Quinn as a ranged marksman - but I’ve also grown really attached to her unique identity as a swift, flying close-quarters hunter. I suspect the two identities are probably impossible to reconcile due to balance issues, but I’ve always seen Quinn as more of a ranged assassin (less on the DPS side, more on the mobility and burst side) than a teamfight-centric marksman, regardless of her ability to solo lane. A version of Quinn that is just a pure marksman would probably not feel very much like Quinn to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Gwenavere","date":"2018-02-14T17:30:47.196+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the issue which concerns me as well.

Some people prefer the new utility ultimate, others prefer the old combat ultimate (although based on our recent survey it looks like this preference tends to track with when you started playing Quinn). People play her as an assassin, a fighter, and a marksman in all 3 lanes and the jungle. She's in this sense one of the most diverse champions in the game, but this obviously presents its own balance challenges (buffs to Quinn mid will push her over the top in top lane, etc).

However, I would be concerned if it looked like Quinn was going to be pushed even more toward the role of a traditional marksman - that was essentially the goal of her rework, and I think it's fallen flat, presenting her with many issues as a result while not really addressing the issues she already had.\n\nAs a lover of the champion, I'm really excited to at least hear _something_.

You're right that she needs some larger scale work, something that makes her more satisfying to play without making her to much more dominant against melees than she already is. \n\nShe was a massive problem when lethality was too strong and her numbers were overtuned too high, then suffered the classic nerf the champ then the items issue.\n\nHowever, I do think she needs a small buff to get her back into a pickable niche state and I'd like to propose a few below.\n\n* Give her the ability to move while channeling her ultimate, it's a LONG 2 second channel time and rooting yourself for Morgana's Q duration and losing 100 mana because one of the caster minions randomly aggro'd onto you is just infuriating.\n* Make building crit more engaging of a choice: right now her passive gets a flat cooldown from crit that doesn't add much to the character or encourage anything besides a hit and run style. Change the way it works so that when Quinn crits the cooldown is actively refunded (1 second vs minions, 2 seconds vs champions), which would make critting a more viscerally feel good experience for Quinn, and allow her to actually stick to a fight because a Quinn player would be encouraged to continue going for a dule and getting more harriers for their attack speed steroid.\n* To push on her scouting behind enemy lines theme, have her W vision move with her passively when she's ulting, give her some means to contribute to the vision game in a way that could be used non-selfishly\n* Let Q's nearsight scale with rank, from 1.5 - 2 seconds at max rank to both allow her to contribute to a team better, and to allow her more windows of opportunity to fight opponents\n* Have harrier give true sight on opponents, so Quinn can choose to not proc harrier if her team wants to chase somebody with stealth down, giving her a big role to play in the counter stealth scouting game.\n\n[As for as long term work goes, I proposed an Idea to change W into a skill that offers a lot more synergy with the rest of her kit, and a lot more skill expression as a whole.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuinnMains/comments/7chxuk/rework_discussion_making_w_a_more_fitting/.)\n\nI would love to open up more communication from a player to a company perspective to help out Quinn, because when the rework came around [I](https://youtu.be/XF9cObyjxO4) [did](https://youtu.be/XEIpIesPOHU) [a](https://youtu.be/gkHHvIp3ZEA) [lot](https://youtu.be/UHMPhCTXWMA) [of](https://youtu.be/eBL8N62W8NQ) [player](https://youtu.be/LB0lI_h0B7k) [side](https://youtu.be/1VtzEics1Lo) [work](https://youtu.be/RvkkoqL9mU0) [advocating](https://youtu.be/tsg3jq786rY) [for](https://youtu.be/s5AhgTcJkhA) [my](https://youtu.be/YKi9GuamtFg) [absolute](https://youtu.be/ijMW2XmZM8g) [favorite](https://youtu.be/aJKuxyznKsI) [champ](https://youtu.be/QYuF4wLk7js) .

I'm extremely glad that you are now commenting on Ahri's state. \n\nI can definitely agree with most of what you are saying here, but I do need to say that W is a peculiar spell that really needs to be fixed from the bottom-up. Currently its AI is not friendly to deal with, especially if there are enemy minions around when you attempt to engage with R W. Often the bolts would just bounce to minions and that drastically decreases how satisfying W is (and mind you, it really isn't that satisfying in the first place).\n\nThe problem with W is that early on, the ability is completely useless. Without sufficient points in it, W's real purpose is only to stack up Ahri's passive. We can't simply choose to max E second and ignore W because otherwise we would be playing with 2 abilities instead of 3, and maxing E has little if any rewards besides a longer CC duration. The ability feels useless early on, but as skirmishes happen and I can chunk someone down just by using R and W, it feels oppressive at times because I am not giving my enemy enough counterplay. I know that Riot has dealt with it and nerfed the AP ratios, but Ahri not being able to do what she is supposed to do when she is fed is not a solution either. \n\nFundamentally, W needs to be completely reworked, and I see making it siimlar to Taliyah Q (without the AoE splash effect) one possible approach. If you want to fix Ahri's issues, you have to tackle with her W and give her a completely new ability. \n\nFor the time being, I think that increasing E's satisfaction when being maxed is a good way to start things off. I strongly recommend that her mana costs for E be decreased in the early game, scaling back to where it is right now as you max the ability. The cooldown early on should be dramatically increased in response, but give E a lower cooldown than 12 seconds when it is fully maxed. That gives a bit more late game strength to Ahri, making it less costly to use charm to make a pick early, but also keep the ability balanced. \n\nQ movespeed should certainly be gone. Ahri should be weak without her ult and charm should be her only means of peeling for herself. That also allows you to redistribute her power budget from the Q movespeed to other abilities in the form of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2018-02-14T17:54:36.022+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"@Meddler,  Why were {{champion:91}} buffs reverted?

Damage dealers/assasins/mages are too weak. Past seasons I remember stacking up to 1100 AP on a full build mage, this season capping to hardly more than 700. Champions like Renekton, Wukong, Ahri, Syndra, Orianna, Rek Sai and many more have fallen out of the game due to being unable to burst down anything.\n\nIf damage dealers are buffed, then they will be able with playmaking burst down fed ADCs unlike now. They will also be able to deal with tanks a bit more to balance the game.\n\nAlso the more damage champions have in general, the more the game will be based on skills since mistakes will be punished hard. Currently as an adc I can let myself take CC, full combo from a dmg dealer and it doesn't do much due to supports peel/not enough dmg of the dmg dealers. \n\nThe more dmg champions have the more the game will depend on smart plays, dodging will be more important, positioning, less mistakes will be allowed to be made and this will separate the skilled players from the others.  Unlike now it's about passive pressuring with champions like malzahar without doing any flashy plays or anything special at all.\n\nI've lately heard a lot of streamers complain that the game isnt as much skill based as it used to be.

Would it be possible to get small or medium buffs on Quinn until larger work can be done? Frankly speaking she sucks, even though I'm having a fair amount of success on her it almost feels more like a function of luck (getting good teammates to carry me) than skill. The two or three buffs I think would be good but not overpowering would be:\n\n1: Increasing her Q damage so that she can consistently 1 shot casters sometime after laning phase ends. Quinn can't push fast enough in the late game to be as much of a split push threat as she should probably be able to and it's because she doesn't deal quite enough damage to casters; this might be fixable with Minion Dematerializer but Quinn gets a lot of power from her secondary runes so dropping them feels bad. She only needs like 10-15 damage right now and it could be added to the base damage, scaling, or both to get it done. This is the MOST IMPORTANT buff I'm requesting; if I got this as a Quinn player I think that'd do miles to make her play better. You could also potentially just make her Q deal 10% more damage to minions or something so that it doesn't effect her damage vs. champions but that change feels slightly inelegant (I'd be fine with it, but it seems like you guys don't like putting in mechanics like that)\n\n2: Make her W active slightly stronger, I'd say making the vision revealed from 2 seconds up to 5 seconds would be great. Quinn is really susceptible to getting camped and this would give her more powerful counterplay to that. Plus, her W just isn't very satisfying so making it a little stronger would help increase the satisfaction of the champion.\n\n3: This is the change that's probably the most dangerous, so if I were working at Riot balance I'd probably just try out the first two and see if I could move Quinn to a better spot without implementing this, but Quinn's mana costs feel too high right now. She has a hard time bullying out the enemy laner since she runs out of mana too quickly and most champions in the meta have very low mana costs. Increasing her mana regen or base mana seems a bit dangerous, as does decreasing the cost of her Q, but maybe making her ult cost between 80 / 40 / 0 to 60 / 30 / 0 mana would help?\n\nAnyways, I hoped the changes I slotted in were reasonable. I'm not a Quinn main but I've got 16 games in high plat / low diamond on Quinn with a 75% win rate which is a lot more than most people since she's such a rare champ, so I figured I'd type up potential changes that I've noticed would feel nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2018-02-14T20:13:46.271+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=ypmoIfEc,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-14T16:18:31.819+0000)\n>\n\n> \n\n> \n> Her highs should arguably be higher and her lows lower.\n\n\nYES thats what i've been thinking for so long\n\nshe is in an okay spot but she is so UNSATISFYING\nno matter how well i play in a game i just dont feel i have much impact\nthat really sucks and i hope you will change her in some way in the future","replies":[]}]}
