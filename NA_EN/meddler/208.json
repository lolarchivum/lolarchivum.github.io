The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Tweaking Champion Voices**\r\n\r\nWe get a lot of good feedback on ways to tweak and improve champions in terms of how their abilities work, loading screen art, visual effects in game, ability audio etc. Generally we can act on that feedback, especially in cases where it&#039;s a small change that&#039;s quick to do and a clear. Champion voices (VO) are usually an exception to that unfortunately and I figured it would be useful to talk about that a bit.\r\n\r\nWith almost every other part of the game we can adjust stuff pretty easily ourselves and in multiple languages. Visual effects artists who work at Riot can adjust spell effects, writers can change champion bios, designers can tweak balance etc. With VO however it&#039;s not that simple a process unfortunately, since we&#039;re using voice actors who don&#039;t work here and have other commitments. That means it&#039;s comparatively difficult to something as simple sounding as one new line. We need to find a time that works for the actors in question and then get them into a recording studio. That&#039;s made much more difficult because there are a lot of voice actors per champion since there&#039;s usually a separate one for each language the game&#039;s in. Sometimes it&#039;s still practical to add or adjust one off lines (e.g. if we&#039;re recording a number of extra lines already for a champion release trailer or something similar it&#039;s easy to add a bit more in too). Generally though it&#039;s not doable, even if the idea&#039;s really cool, which can really suck when somebody suggests a fantastic idea. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Possible change to how we do gameplay patches next year**\r\n\r\nSomething we&#039;ve been talking about recently is whether to try a slightly different approach for a while early next to year to how we release gameplay patches. At present most patches are very similar to each other. We&#039;ve been considering trying an alternating large gameplay patch/small gameplay patch cycle however. The small patches would only contain balance changes that are for things in dire need of a change (e.g. very strong or very weak champions), or extremely simple changes that aren&#039;t too disruptive and don&#039;t need as much testing (e.g. base stat tweaks). The large patches by contrast would then contain larger balance changes, mini updates, item changes, Runes adjustments etc. Total amount of change over time would likely be fairly similar, though more concentrated. One of the biggest possible benefits there is that that would allow us to spend more time on longer term fixes for things, and less on short term adjustments that don&#039;t always fix fundamental problems. One of the biggest downsides is some things would potentially get addressed slower than they currently do. Curious as to people&#039;s thoughts on such an approach?\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Xin Zhao update probably in 7.19**\r\n\r\nAs per the title there it&#039;s likely the XZ update ships in patch 7.19. For anyone unfamiliar with context on it it&#039;s a smaller update, so will involve tweaks to some of his skills and stats while keeping most of his kit very similar to its current functionality. A few spell/character animation updates, but in terms of art and audio generally very similar to (small gameplay update, not full VGU). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Azir update almost certainly in 7.19**\r\n\r\nAzir&#039;s changes have continued to test well so we&#039;re pretty confident they&#039;ll be in 7.19. They don&#039;t involve replacing any of his abilities, so sit somewhere between a really heavy balance/tuning pass and a small update. As previously mentioned a lot of the focus to the update is reducing his ranges to create better counterplay and more risk taking, then putting power elsewhere. We&#039;ve read through a fair bit of feedback from some people who feel that&#039;s the less thematic fit for an emperor, and understand where that&#039;s coming from, but feel that leaving his range as is and instead removing mobility both fails to fix needed issues and leads to a flatter playstyle, hence this direciton. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Le Blanc update&#039;s quite a while away**\r\n\r\nNot too much new to say here, mentioning it though since it&#039;s a topic that seems to get raised constantly and figure it&#039;s better to talk about it visibly here rather than less visibly in the replies every single time. Le Blanc&#039;s update hasn&#039;t hit a good point yet, so it&#039;s going to be quite a while before it&#039;s out - she&#039;s got a lot of problems that need to be solved, with the core being desire to do assassin things without taking assassin risks. Extremely unlikely it&#039;ll be before pre-season (November) at an absolute minimum, more likely sometime next year. We don&#039;t have any current plans for balance changes to her between now and whenever the update comes out, though if circumstances change (e.g. if new Runes make her dramatically weaker or stronger) we&#039;d reassess that of course.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-09-01T17:07:02.206+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, what do you think about doing a VO pass on how taunts are used? right now a lot of 'lore' taunts never get heard in game because you just don't usually use taunts in the heat of battle. But newer champions and skins have lines play automatically when attacking other champions, or killing them, or even just spawning in game vs each other or walking into lane near each other (ie dawnbringer riven and nightbringer yasuo, Camille)\n\njust as an example, currently these are some Azir lines\n> \"You are but a grain of sand, Xerath.\" \n> \"Emperors have no rivals, Xerath. Only liabilities.\" \n> \"Xerath, it is time your spark went out.\" \n> \"You have already failed, Xerath. You must now accept it.\" \n> \"Traitor, I cast you to the winds.\" \n> \"You are but my shadow, Xerath.\" \n> \"Xerath, the time of your judgment has come.\" \n> \nand these are some Xerath lines \n> \"Azir, at long last, we will see what power you truly possess.\" \n> \"You are emperor of a wasteland, Azir.\" \n> \"Azir, the boy destined to chase the sun.\" \n> \"This time, Azir, I will need no surprise to topple you.\" \n> \nBut these are only activated by using the taunt key so close to the other champion that they're probably like, too close to each other for their usual long range combat lol.\n\nImagine if it was more like, spawning in game vs each other, and hearing each others lines\n> \"Xerath, the time of your judgment has come.\" \n> \"This time, Azir, I will need no surprise to topple you.\" \n> \nmeeting in lane\n> \"Xerath, it is time your spark went out.\" \n> \"This time, Azir, I will need no surprise to topple you.\" \n> \nAzir kills Xerath \n> \"Traitor, I cast you to the winds.\" \n\nAzir damages Xerath\n> \"Emperors have no rivals, Xerath. Only liabilities.\" \n> \"You are but my shadow, Xerath.\" \n\nXerath damages Azir\n> \"You are emperor of a wasteland, Azir.\" \n\nXerath kills Azir\n> play a laugh line\n\nor whatever. I picked these 2 because I think they're a good example of how much more epic these voice lines could be just by adjusting how they activate, but it applies to any champion that was made before Camille but has a healthy amount of taunts for different characters. you can also apply general taunts to kills/fighting.\n\n\nedit: I also enjoy the new voice overs for lux and maokai and I think we'd get more mileage out of them with an approach like above... and if you happen to be bringing in voice actors for legendary skins or something like you did with lux it might not be a bad time to look at the classic vo. basically I hope you don't discontinue them completely.

Losing  arround 5% seems \" fine \" for you ? As a champion designed to be strong in solo queue ? Meh. Ahri is very behind meta picks. You attempted changes to shake the midlane meta, and give Ahri some indirect buff through this, but we have to say that it was a huge fail. Syndra/Orianna/Cassio are and will still be better, despite nerfs. \n\nPretty fun to see that Ahri got a huge nerf while being almost not played in competitive ( most of the time vs Orianna to counter her, even if Orianna clapped most of Ahris on lane ), and those champions, picked or banned pretty much every game, receive very small nerfs, never got their ratios hit, or with compensation. Ahri just got a raw nerf, making her useless if she doesn't land her charm. This does not feel fair, like not at all. Ahri will NOT see any play at worlds if she stays like this, and you know it. When you see pros not picking Ahri vs Orianna + Jarvan, prefering to pick SYNDRA, I mean, that should be enough to see there's a problem with the champion. Putting more power into the charm which is dodgeable, flashable, cleansed, qss'd, banshee'd, tanked by a front liner ... has hurt her so hard.\n\nHopefuly you'll realize that you were wrong, and give Ahri more tools outside of her charm, even if you have to cut her mobility, Ahri needs changes. But hey if you're fine seeing Syndra Orianna Cassio Lucian Corki just farming and waiting, every single worlds game, paired with tanks everywhere, that's your choice I guess.

Maybe making it so his e does more to camps in order to help his clear which he majorly needs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecondComing","date":"2017-09-01T17:22:25.413+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello good sir @Meddler\n\nI'd really like to hear your thoughts on some champs\n\n1. {{champion:133}} ADC is currently her worst role (many people say that, among them Challenger players) and to no surprise. E works well if you're an assassin but not that well for an adc who wants to stay safe and use basic attacks(it works that way if you use it at melee range which you shouldn't be in the first place). Same with ult (mobility is nice but the other parts not that much; at least made more sense when it functioned like an execute). Don't you think this translates to design and/or update (during the marksman update) failure? Not bashing, just expressing. Wouldn't she need work (big or smaller) at some point to cement whether she should be classified as adc or not?\n\n2. {{champion:54}} Would you say he could use a VGU? I'd think so.\n\n3. {{champion:254}} You've been kind with her recently and I'm grateful for that. Do you think she could use some more small buffs and/or quality of life changes in order for her to be pushed into pro play material?\n\nGlad you brought champion VO up. Imho, it's really a shame and unfair that some champs barely have 10 lines or less altogether and the only way for them to get new/expanded VO is via a skin (legendary/ultimate most of the time) that not all of the players can access while newer ones have 6-7 lines for the same thing, just different tone/accent/punctuation. For example, during Burning Tides, {{champion:41}} got an insanely large new VO, both basic and in his Captain skin while MF {{champion:21}} nothing to reflect that big story she went through (not even a specific taunt towards GP feelsbad). Many people call her bimbo with guns which isn't the case- at least, not anymore. I understand that it can be hard if you want to do everything with the original voice actor(s) but technology allows for some great facilitations nowadays. For example, with some sound editing, I believe you could make new lines sound as close to the source material as possible (even the exact same).\n\nFor the change to how patches come, I don't mind, so long as you said tackle problems quickly (for example, if we get something like release Camille or post rework Malz/Morde straight from the oven). On the other hand, large patches don't need to be that frequent- especially if they're XL, they can confuse people that it's pre/mid season all over again lol.\n\nAnd finally, here's an idea for an Inspiration keystone\n\n**Feels Good to Share**: Target enemy Champion. All of current debuffs you have get transferred to the target and all of target's current buffs are transferred to you for the duration (maybe make it have really small range so it won't be that much stronger on ranged champs).","replies":[{"poster":"rathy Aro","date":"2017-09-01T17:43:23.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quinn has never been intended to play as an adc.

Quinn's pbe thread was easily the largest out of every other marksman being updated then- and not for good reasons.\n\nLatest balance changes she went through stated that they wanted to push her away from burst and more into DPS (which is what adcs do by book), by reducing the AD ratio on ult and increasing the % att speed you get from W (those were dev comments btw). \n\nSo, \"never intended to play as adc\" and \"nothing actually wrong with her\"? Yeah, I don't think so really... It's not like Graves whose update clearly intended for him to be played as a jungler/not adc (tho people still play him there)","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2017-09-01T20:36:01.755+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"so... the pbe complaings were largely lore/thematic complaints?\n\nIn gameplay, my opinion with Quinn is that, because of the tools available in her kit, she would remain a viable, valuable, and highly effective champion even if her damage output were _cut in half._\n\nI don't say that because I think she deals too much damage I say it because her biggest strengths_ have nothing to do with damage_.\nHer blind.\nMap-wide-mobility.\nHer engage/disengage dash.\nVision benefits.\nIf she were nerfed, she might play a different role, but I don't see such a champion ever struggling for something useful to do.\n\nIf she dealt DPS as high as other Marksmen do, wouldn't that overshadow what she already has?\n\nWhy would you even **want** her to be like the other Marksmen? \n##She's Unique.
