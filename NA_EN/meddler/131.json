The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**8.24b and 9.1 changes on PBE**\r\n\r\nFor the next couple of weeks you&#039;ll see a number of changes on the PBE, some of which are candidates for 8.24b (December 18th), some of which will be in 9.1 (early January). We&#039;re still assessing what should go into 8.24b versus what needs more testing. Additionally various types of changes, mainly those that change anything that isn&#039;t just a number (e.g. different words on a tooltip, modified visual effects etc), aren&#039;t able to be included in 8.24b so will be in 9.1 as a result. Should have a fairly clear idea of what&#039;s going out this month and what&#039;s later late next week.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Quality of Life Work in 9.1**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of 9.1 something else we&#039;re working on for it is range of improvements in a few categories.\r\n\r\nImproved info when pinging certain abilities\r\n\r\n* For many global and semi global abilities, which targets are in range (Nocturne R, Caitlyn, Pantheon R etc)\r\n* Potentially extra useful info on other abilities, like ammo remaining on Heimer Q, whether Soraka is blocked from casting W due to lack of health (not just lack of mana) etc\r\n* Probably won&#039;t include ability to ping passives like Draven&#039;s to show number of stacks in 9.1. That&#039;s on our list of things to add, but likely requires some engineering work because of the way passives are set up differently to spells.\r\n\r\nMore use of the spell icon countdown border like Zoe Q uses to more clearly show duration of various effects to the player casting them.\r\n\r\n* Lot of potential users for this. Examples we&#039;re currently testing include Braum E, Jax R, how long Karthus has to start casting his R while in passive, Trynd R, Yasuo Q3 etc.\r\n\r\nA bit more spell buffering\r\n\r\n* In addition to the buffering with Kat and Gunblade mentioned earlier in the week we&#039;re also testing out a bit of buffering on Zyra (QW and EW) and Jayce (QE)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Rıots Bad Client","date":"2018-12-07T16:46:56.021+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do you think its possible to add the spell buffers for {{champion:26}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxinior from LAN","date":"2018-12-07T17:52:06.507+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about Sejuani?

Sometimes there's a want to work together with other people rather than verse against them, a PvE mode would fill that void.\n3. People are generally less toxic and more forgiving in a PvE environment.\n4. It's fun to feel really powerful, which you can't do in PvP due to balance issues\n5. It's also fun to one-man many monsters and make plays in PvE, 1v5s go poorly in PvP\n\nMany other reasons too but currently don't have the time to list.","replies":[{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2018-12-07T18:36:31.941+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your 3 and 6 are the same, might want to edit one out ;)\n\nI agree with all of them, this basically is the appeal of a MMO but without the tedious stuff like grinding an epic, ancient sword before tossing it away for a more epic, more ancient sword, endless open worlds with almost nothing to do, min-maxing your character (kind of similar to grinding), excluding players from raids because of certain stats below a threshold etc.\n\nOpen world is impossible because we jumped straight into the raids with both the Star Guardian and Odyssey, and I hope it stays that way for future PvE modes.\n\nMost of the other stuff is related to progression or power. In League, our character is basically set and there is little progression over the course of an event. Sure, we had augments, but they were never a requirement, as the missions to do Onslaught with less than x augments showed. They were a reward, not a gameplay requirement. They did add a reasonable amount of power, but it was not impossible to beat with \"weak\" augments, there were lots of viable builds and most of them were equally powerful (for most of the players, I am not talking about the abuse cases in the Onslaught high score list and that one Ziggs thing).\n\nIn addition to the above list, some of my reasons for PvE include: \n\n1. It's more fun to work together than to work against someone. You can test your skill in other ways while playing with someone, you don't need a flashy Lee Sin or Zed outplay to prove that you are good. (I might be biased here because I like playing support and this is one of my main reasons for that)\n2. It's a good entry point. Playing PvP for the first time can be really hard, and I struggle with that in any new game I play. I recently bought Titanfall 2 and I was really anxious about playing multiplayer for the first time. I got wrecked (obviously) and then I discovered the PvE mode which was an instant relief for me. (This plays into 1 and 3 of the original list, because it's often low-stakes.)\n3. A feeling of unity. Sure, you work together on SR, but you don't really feel united. That's one of my high points in PvP: When you coordinated a fight really well and everyone did their job and that's why you won the fight (and maybe even the game). However, that is not always the case in PvP, especially when solo carry potential exists. When it's PvE, you genuinely care about the other persons, because it's you against the world and you need to rely on them. This feeling of hopelessness, against all odds, your group against the world can much better be conveyed in a PvE mode.\n\nWell, this was much longer than I expected it to be, but please, give us more events like Star Guardian or Odyssey. PvE can be really fun, especially if it's connected to the lore so few people care about.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ataraxas","date":"2018-12-07T19:22:22.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add even more points to my previous ones: \n\n6. You don't have to verse similar things to what you already are. With PvP the two teams must be on similar grounds, but with PvE there is a A LOT more creative freedom to make things enjoyable.\n\n7. Concept of raiding is fun as well.

Although it is short lived, she gains bonus magic damage, movement speed, invisibility and has a controllable clone. \n\nFor comparison, both Wukong's Decoy (stand still clone and magic damage) and Pyke's Ghostwater Dive (camoflauge and movement speed) both cost mana. I understand LeBlanc's clone cost no mana, but its also located on her passive.\n\nJust wanted to know the rationale behind the no cost for this ability.\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"AzuBK","date":"2018-12-07T19:28:08.424+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, I can field this one because I happened to suggest it to SolCrushed late in Neeko development. W has minimal combat benefit during lane, so using it offensively when it had a mana cost was usually negative value—that mana could go to waveclear or poke instead (you would mostly only press W when you were getting ganked). W is also pretty hard to use effectively and takes some learning, so it was important that she want to use it frequently in lane in order to get practice on the ability in a non-life-or-death settings. Removing the mana cost and moving that cost to Q/E meant that Neeko players are encouraged to try and trick people with her W in lane as much as possible (using it to set up tricky E angles especially), giving players way more practice both with and against the spell and offering a different laning experience from the more standard mage pattern.","replies":[{"poster":"Guts Man","date":"2018-12-07T20:27:44.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AzuBK,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=EmjGouud,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-07T19:28:08.424+0000)\n>\n> Hey, I can field this one because I happened to suggest it to SolCrushed late in Neeko development.

So how I understand the rationale is that if this ability had a mana cost, it'd be used primarily to get away from ganks during the laning phase, rather than a \"deception\" tool on her enemies. I guess the way I saw it in my head, was Neeko is getting a free engage/disengage, with multiple benefits at no cost other than a cooldown - I thought this was a bit odd but the way you explained it makes sense. \n\nI guess that brings me to my next question, if you're able to answer, about other abilities in the game that have a similar purpose (albeit a different effect), such as Decoy. I'm only asking because I feel like the Decoy ability is similar in numerous ways, but still costs mana which would affect waveclear and timing on when the ability can be used to deceive an opponent.\n\nOnce again, thanks for your answer! I appreciate it and it definitely helps understand why this was done.","replies":[{"poster":"AzuBK","date":"2018-12-07T21:01:23.896+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't given Decoy much depth of thought, so there may be something I'm missing, but I think it's a bit different in that it's a more mandatory part of Wukong's combat pattern. He is encouraged to cast it aggressively, because his trading pattern as a melee champion with no other disengage or mitigation makes it very valuable, so there's no need to take the somewhat unconventional step of making it free so that he feels like he should cast the spell (which was required for Neeko). It's still possible that there are enough reasons that it might make sense as a free/very low cost spell, but that would certainly come at a some cost to his other abilities or the actual output of Decoy.\n\nTo sum it up: it might make sense, but at face value I don't think the final changelist would make Wukong a meaningfully better champion, because he'd still play very similarly but with some values shifted around (could be wrong here). For Neeko, it was super important because players felt like using her most unique spell in lane was the wrong choice, and removing its cost made that no longer true. Additionally, she's just very difficult to gank when her W is available, so there's value in prompting her to put it on cooldown for reasons aside from escaping.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Seraphim117","date":"2018-12-07T18:54:53.622+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is gangplank still a candidate for buffs?
