{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-02-13T16:43:02.697+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: February 13","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we're doing, or planning to do, that isn't yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Support Item Restrictions**\r\n\r\nAs you might have seen we've just hotfixed some changes to the Ancient Coin and Spellthief's items so that they require a nearby ally to generate gold coins and gold on damage procs respectively. That's in response to rapidly growing use of them in top lane that removes a lot of CSing skill test for the user while offering little counterplay to their opponent. Usually we'd prefer to let emergent strategies play out where we can. Our feeling in this case, as with gold funneling last year, was that the overall result is a less interesting and deep game though, hence the quick response.\r\n\r\nAlso as per gold funneling we're taking what's admittedly somewhat heavy handed action to quickly fix the problem. Plan is to then look at whether there's a better solution available in the moderate term. With the Monster Hunter debuff for gold funneling for example our initial take was sometimes pretty punishing on junglers who got ahead but didn't want to finish their jungle item. We then made an adjustment later that changed it to account for amount of gold taken from lane minions to target the debuff specifically at problem cases. Goal would be to take a similar approach here if we see unintended issues emerge. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Crit items, their users and marksmen in general post 9.3**\r\n\r\nWe've been watching how things have settled post crit changes in 9.3 for a bit now. Feeling so far is that the changes have landed pretty well overall, without leaving most crit users too strong or too weak. Where we're up to on some specific cases:\r\n\r\n* Still got Yasuo nerfs planned for 9.4. Current approach is reverting most of the buffs we gave him after midseason's Infinity Edge update since that update's mostly reverted.\r\n* We'll also be bringing back the Lucian nerfs we held off on previously while we waited to see where 9.3 landed, in part given he was already strong and crit item buffs are sometimes further power positive for him at 3-4 items. \r\n* Unlikely we do anything for Kai'Sa at this point, she seems to be doing pretty well with IE/Hurricane builds. Updating her recommended items so players stop rushing Stormrazor, though.\r\n* Want to see where Ezreal sits after some more play before deciding whether he needs nerfs or not. \r\n* Looking at a small buff to ER in 9.4, it's in the right ballpark but a bit weak relative to IE.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Spectator Bugs**  \r\n\r\nWe'e looking into a couple of categories of spectator bug that have been cropping up a lot recently. Should have more to share on that shortly. 9.4 should have fixes for some issues, still determining whether there's anything not covered by that work though. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"GrandMastrOfCool","date":"2019-02-13T16:45:30.710+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":8,"body":"Have you guys considered making AP bruiser/fighter items?

Yeah I know they are not bruisers, but once Riot started to force them all to support role and then were surprised that the mains that didn't like the support versions of these champions left them. Then Riot started to balance them around that role even though they were original loved in other roles. but Riot decided, \"Nope, you are now this role.\" This is how it feels with AP Bruisers.\n\nExample, Diana, she is supposed to be a AP Diver and since the itemization is none existent for AP Fighters/Bruisers she is forced to be balanced around a full AP build and is now considered by most an assassin.

It favours a burst playstyle. The most of us view Karma as a Battlemage/Enchanter, always has been. We were mad whenever changes occurred which pushed her away from that and now this rework kills her Battlemage identity for good.\n\n2. The rework picked a side. This rework was opportunity to unify her divided playerbase, but instead dividing it more. There's zero attempt at a compromise and all that says to us is that we're not valued. \n\n3. It addresses almost none of her issues. The only problem this rework solves is giving her something that isn't currently in the game, which happens to be discarded mechanics from {{champion:26}} {{champion:16}}. It attempts to solve RE's issues by discouraging its use on a full team, instead of bringing back shield bomb in some form - like I'm sure you know most of us wanted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaghyr","date":"2019-02-13T16:48:10.499+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":9,"body":"What are your thoughts on {{champion:498}}?

Either buff his mana pool and mana growth or decrease his mana costs \n\nMage itemization needs a overall rework and give clear item paths for the AP champions to choose depending on the class of the champion.\n\nSorceress shoes needs to be nerfed back to 10 Magic Penetration. No AP champion should have a easy access to the highest magic penetration item by only 1100 gold and so early in the game.\n\n\nSupport items are abused by other laners the same way Kleptomancy is. Making them only be triggered when allies are nearby was a good idea, but Kleptomancy also needs to be a more Support Keystone only, than a exploitable rune.","replies":[{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2019-02-13T19:05:25.313+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Sorceress shoes needs to be nerfed back to 10 Magic Penetration.\n\nIt was 15 and after they took our 8 magic pen from runes it was added back on sorch shoes and void. Stop complaining and use magic resist runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Drifter","date":"2019-02-13T22:38:36.958+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am aware that it was 15 magic penetration, but at that time we didnt have a first item bursty buy for mages like we have now.

Its clear that you did not play mages in the Season 7. Assassins could still overkill you if they all-in you and you didnt flash with Morello. Now they have a 90 Ability power item with a passive that adds 100 + extra AP to their damage, with counting Sudden Impact magic penetration bonus. \n\nAt Season 7, rushing Negatron Cloack was actually viable. At this moment it doesnt matter, you will still die or you will be seriously behind in itemization and you will be useless the rest of the game. What a great concept! \n\nAlso being forced to build a defensive first item in the laning phase is ridiculous and it only shows how unbalanced the game is. You know, no one should just automatically win a laning phase just because they pick a assassin or any other champion no matter the role. The players skill should be the judge and result of who wins or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
