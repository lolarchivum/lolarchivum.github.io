The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**8.10 and 8.11**\r\n \r\n8.11 is the patch that will have some marksmen item and base stat adjustments in it, along with some other stuff including some tweaks to early jungling. Those changes will be on the PBE during the 8.10 cycle (so starting next week) and we&#039;ll have some context posts about them up just before that.\r\n \r\n8.10 also has some stuff in it too of course and wanted to talk about some of that:\r\n \r\n* Bounty changes (solo gold instead of team gold) will be in 8.10. After those are out, and the 8.11 changes have had some impact on how much teams look to marksmen to carry versus other positions we&#039;ll then consider rolling out further changes aimed at getting more solo carry potential back. Doing so over a series of patches rather than all at once to avoid swinging too hard and creating other problems (e.g. things like excessive early snowball).\r\n \r\n* Potentially some follow up balance work on mana items and/or mages, depending on exactly where the 8.9 changes land. If we need to add power to individual champs a common starting point&#039;s going to be adding more impact to abilities, rather than defaulting to giving them mana back (don&#039;t want to just reintroduce the issues we&#039;re trying to fix with these changes). Definitely possible mana is what will be appropriate in some cases where spell impact&#039;s already high as are mana needs though of course.\r\n \r\n* Some regular balance/game health work, including Kha&#039;Zix (R evolution gameplay needs work), Sion (low interaction waveclear), Sterak&#039;s (making it more relevant to more champs by reducing or removing Triforce synergy and providing other power).\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**8.9 and Baron/Herald**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;ve been testing changes to Baron and Rift Herald&#039;s stats for a while and those are going out in 8.9. Figured it was worth mentioning even this late in the 8.9 cycle since that doesn&#039;t seem to have got that much attention. \r\n \r\nBaron:\r\n \r\n* Whether or not your team can take an early Baron is currently too dependent on whether not you&#039;ve got a strong tank who&#039;s in a good spot around 20 mins. That can lead to games that are effectively over dragging out until the winning team feel safe taking Baron and puts more pressure on team comps to include tanks.\r\n* We&#039;re distributing damage more evenly across teams during the Baron fight as a result. Base damage at 20 mins is down to 285 from 400 for example, AOE damage however is up (to 120+0.3 AD per second, from 60+0.1)\r\n* We&#039;re also seeing Baron get taken too quickly, which doesn&#039;t give opponents enough time to contest and force a fight. That takes away a window for comebacks and can make a brief period of Baron control too influential in deciding that game&#039;s outcome. \r\n* We&#039;re adding more base health to Baron as a result (9000, from 6400).\r\n \r\nRift Herald:\r\n \r\n* Rift Herald&#039;s not always delivering on its intended purpose at present. It&#039;s frequently better to just take a tower direct and not consider Rift Herald. It&#039;s also not serving to help games that are functionally over resolve quicker. \r\n* As a result we&#039;re reducing the damage it takes when hitting towers (150 less)  and increasing damage it deals to towers (was 25% of own health +150, now the greater of 40% of its current health and 1500).\r\n* To avoid it being too impactful on even games, and better reward intended counterplay, we&#039;re also increasing the damage the summoned Rift Herald takes when you hit it in eye (was 20% max hp, now 40%). Quick response will shut it down quicker than before, if unchecked it&#039;ll more consistently take at least one tower.\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-04-27T15:40:02.013+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's the plan for {{item:3814}}  ?\n\nWhat's your thought on {{item:3147}} since the last nerf/adjustement ?\n\nAnd globaly what do u think about lethality ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadPiriPiri","date":"2018-04-27T16:56:38.552+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any plans for {{champion:22}} ?\n\nI would like that {{item:3042}} was an ad scaling item just like {{item:3040}}, do you have any plans on making it more viable on more champion (the only one who use it is {{champion:81}} )?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ARE YOU PC BRO","date":"2018-04-27T16:53:55.218+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"When KARMA gets her re-work make sure to hire her old V.A.

While it may seem consistent, it isn't really in that Cassiopeia is nerfed lvl 4 onwards as an aggressive single target mage while Azir is nerfed lvl 7 onwards as an AOE waveclearing mage. The changes favour low mana growth with high lvl 1 mana. And that the mana nerfs range from 300 to 200.\n\nIt should've been a simple +x at lvl 1, breaking even at lvl 6, -y at lvl 18. (So it'd be flat amounts like all mages gain 90 mana and their growth is nerfed by the same amount)\n\n-------\n\nEven then I think mana changes should be held off because I feel like mana numbers weren't well thought out in the first place (a lot of old champions probably had their mana costs and pools decided way back in 2009 and items/design was different back then). Like I don't think it was an intentional design choice at the time for Anivia to need so much mana with Archangel's RoA back when she'd just ERR (and oneshot lol) instead of keeping ult channeled.\n\nI just don't think the interaction between costs, pools and items were thought out explicitly. Designer just went \"hey this champ should build mana items because she/he's blue and mage-y, so let's make their costs high\" *puts 100 mana cost spell without doing math on how much mana per second it would use on average, or how niche/bread and butter the spell is* \"okay I playtested this champ and keep going oom let's increase the mana pool\" *gives a random number of buffs until it feels right*\n\nIt would explain why a lot of older champions have above average mana pools and decently large costs before getting reworked to have like only 60 mana per cast. Low mana pool and low costs might not have been seen very differently from high mana pool and high costs (in fact the latter could be seen as more mage-y and caster-y signifying more powerful spells and a larger reservoir of magical energy, even though it would decrease efficiency with mana items! With the exception of Archangel's mana - AP % passive)\n\nMana pools, items and costs as a whole should be looked into at some point with the interactions between them explicitly in mind at some point, namely:\n\n- Higher consumption decrease synergy with mana pools and items (more mana for the same amount of damage, therefore less efficiency)\n- However, higher consumption increases *demand* of mana pools and items (going oom less is very valuable)\n- Higher mana pool decreases both need and synergy with items (why get 500 more mana when you already have 2000?). Growth and base pools decide when this need and synergy is at its highest or lowest.\n- Item mana changes will buff and nerf the class as a whole manawise\n\nOr if you wanted to go for some easy shortcut you could make all mana items give a % of your base mana to cut down the factors, but that would be serious laziness and would do things like make mages either heavily gold, or heavily level dependent","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-04-27T17:58:25.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What wave clear?

And for the ally team\n\n\nI'm agree with the passive it need some change, I love the idea about CC immune on the W and yes his Q is fine (maybe make the animation faster).\n\nFor Jugdment I don't know, that why i hate the juggernaut rework on Garen in season 5, I deal not enough damage in early game and i don't have the time to deal a entire E on enemy in mid/late, that's why I think it would be cool if he gets his old base damage and his AD ratio.\n\n10 / 22.5 / 35 / 47.5 / 60  (+ 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55% AD) (God i miss the old Garen early).\n\nAbout the villain mechanic well..., it can be good but to random and bugged in my opinion (for example I have an enemy Thresh who is marked as the villain but he only got 1 kill and the Tristana with 12 kill will never be vilain until I kill her without the vilain passive).\n\nIt's my opinion and i understand if you do not agree with everything.\n\nAnyway, it's really cool to talk with another Garen Main, and I really appreciate you respond to my comment ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-04-27T19:32:54.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll be making a lot of changes with very little review time, followed by (what I assume will be) immediate adjustments on the first or second patch afterwards **alongside** additional changes (8.9: Mage changes, 8.10: Mage adjustments + solo gold changes, 8.11: further Mage adjustments + universal adjustments because of  solo gold changes + Marksmen changes, 8.12: lots and lots of adjustments + whatever else you have planned).

What do you think of Zyra's current Q shape right now compared to the old circular shape? \n\n- The rectangular shape was introduced to synergy with Zyra's current passive and its primary job was to \"summon plants\"? Yet you nerfed/changed its AI so many times that it required Zyra to land her abilities for the plants to priority the enemy champs. Other than that, it doesn't go well with any other part of her kits. I'm a little confused because the new Q shape primary job is to just summon more plants out but awkward to use/harder to land but plants won't priority champs if you don't land it. Since plants are so weak right now. \n\nMy question: why are you still keeping Zyra's current Q shape when the old Q can basically do the same thing with an outer layer of what the current Q has but easier to use and more synergy to her kit?

Is he out of line when played in other roles? If you were to nerf him a lot of us rakan players would rather just a revert on the ap ratios.
