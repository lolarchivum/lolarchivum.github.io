In the next couple of weeks we&rsquo;ll be putting out a longer &lsquo;State of the Game&rsquo; post. Right now though we figured it&rsquo;d be good to share some thoughts on bot lane marksmen.\n\nWe&rsquo;ve seen quite a bit of feedback that marksmen feel weak in bot lane, lacking power and agency. Thoughts on that below, along with some things we need to look into further. \n-\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n**Things we&rsquo;re pretty confident in:**\n\n* We believe that the biggest priority right now is addressing jungler dominance, with junglers able to gank more often, and more successfully, than appropriate. Bot lane&rsquo;s particularly targeted by those ganks and we think that&rsquo;s a significant part of current frustration with marksman agency/power. \n\n-&gt; We&rsquo;ll need to reduce jungler power beyond just the XP tweaking in 7.1. Not sure how exactly yet (working on that this week and next).\n\n* Courage of the Colossus is still too strong. That contributes to some characters feeling unkillable for marksmen. Some of those champs are also too strong in general as well (hi Poppy).\n\n-&gt; We&rsquo;ll be nerfing Courage of the Colossus. Investigating right now whether that&rsquo;ll be nerfs to the best case scenarios primarily or more general nerfs. \n\n* At least a couple of individual marksmen need buffs. Lucian&rsquo;s the biggest example by a large margin, having been hit really hard by the pre-season changes. \n\n-&gt; We&rsquo;ve got Lucian and Draven buffs in 7.1 and are assessing other candidates for 7.2 or 7.3 (e.g. potentially Ashe). \n\n* We&rsquo;d like to support non Marksmen as options bot lane if the gameplay created is healthy. We&rsquo;ve long felt it would be good for the game for a variety of lane setups to be viable and the farming position bot lane&rsquo;s been a particularly static one. Right now Ziggs is the only non marksman getting played there a meaningful amount (around the same play rate as Corki and Tristana). So far his impact on the lane seems reasonable, with a range of ways to respond to it and an appropriate power level. \n\n-&gt; We&rsquo;ll be keeping a really close eye on Ziggs bot lane. Assuming it stays healthy and interesting it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;d want to support if it looks like a viable thing. \n\n* We want marksmen to be excellent choices bot lane. We&rsquo;d like to see other classes there at least a bit, but don&rsquo;t want to see them push marksman out or overshadow them at their core strengths. If they&rsquo;re not really effective picks bot lane that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll address quickly. \n\n-\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n**Some other things we&rsquo;re looking at:**\n\n* General power level and agency of all positions in the game, bot in particular (both marksman and support).\n* Whether marksmen power curves are appropriately tuned (e.g. Should we offer more mid game power rather than late game power for some champs/builds?)\n* Whether we&rsquo;re offering the appropriate tools to kill really tanky champs as a marksmen, something that should generally be a strength relative to other classes.\n* What sort of changes we might need to make to the item system to reduce tanky champions from getting too much damage or some damaging champions from getting too tanky to deal with for their damage.\n\n-\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n\nHope that offers some useful insight. More details, on this topic and a range of others, to follow soon (gotta catch up on that communication quiet period from over the break).\n\nMeddler","replies":[{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2017-01-05T21:51:02.490+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":14,"body":"I definitly agree jungler dominance is a huge problem to me as an adc main\n\nit seems like the jungler can come bot 100 times with no punishment in levels or gold.\n\nTheres just too much influence from other lanes","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-01-05T22:06:50.894+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yep.

Riot - what about an experiment where Baron and Dragon's spawn points are swapped?  This would take the jungler's main focus early game up top effectively balancing map 2-1-2 instead of 1-1-3.  Or at least it might.  And then it would require less mechanical balancing since it's not a mechanical issue it's a time/opportunity cost issue.

Now I don't know too much about balance changing or what not but I feel currently a jungler's decision on which side of the map he/she should hit should not come so easy. There should be a real incentive to spend resources top to have your team gain a REAL global net worth. Right now top side has rift herald, this objective even when it was considered remotely good always paled in comparison to certain drakes, and it only ever applied to one team member. That's why I feel that objective should be changed in someway, i don't really care or mind if you would like to change its appearance, name, or whatever but what the said monster gives has to give a TEAM a net worth. So I personally propose that in exchange for one team stacking drakes down bot on one side of the map, the other should have a decision to go top for something like well oh idk how bout some gold? An old concept from a few seasons ago that worked beautifully. Killing said new top monster would give a certain amount of global gold for the team while a smart jungler bot would often trade that with an infernal,cloud,mountain,ocean down bot. obviously some balancing would need to be done to make this work that goes over my head but the idea is what should be considered.\n\ntl;dr Give junglers an incentive to gank top side by replacing the old rift herald with a new neutral monster that gives global gold to the entire team, alleviating repeated pressure bot side and only bot side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2017-01-05T22:40:54.579+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=2QqErugJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-01-05T21:44:58.526+0000)\n> **Some other things we&amp;rsquo;re looking at:**\n> \n> * General power level and agency of all positions in the game, bot in particular (both marksman and support).\n> Meddler\n\nI don't think you can give everyone more agency.

If both bot positions are low on agency for example that implies at least one other position is too high.\n\nIt could be that marksmen items just aren't \"coming online\" soon enough.\n\nThe plain matter of fact is there is a lot more shields and healing going on everywhere, so armor has become incredibly valuable.\n\nBy the time marksmen get a lifesteal item and two crit items the most burly targets just don't care, and can withstand consistent auto attacks for a very long time.\n\nIt seems to me that the marksmen items are what is lacking, not the marksmen themselves. Specifically, there isn't any reasonable way to threaten a tank with physical damage by mid game, so people have figured out that taking an spammy ap carry bot lane like ryze or cassio or ziggs will do more damage, even if the enemy builds nothing but magic resist and health.\n\nRight now last whisper's derivatives are tweaked to be most effective when the enemy stacks truly absurd levels of armor, like 300-400. The issue is that it doesn't do much against shield spam on someone with a moderate level of bonus armor and fairly good base armor, say like 160 ish armor at mid game.\n\nIf they have 60 base armor and 100 bonus armor, last whisper is 45 pen, while black cleaver would provide 48 and if it were magic resist instead, void staff would provide 56. On top of that, mages can easily spec both void staff and flat pen, and they stack in the best possible way.\n\nI realize that if a person COULD have enough magic resist to shrug off mages it leaves the mages feeling bad because they can't really do anything against that target. But by your own admission, marksmen should ideally be better at melting burly targets than anyone else.\n\nThats a problem with the itemization, not the individual champions. In my opinion, marksmen items need to be less focused on raw damage and more focused on agnostic damage all around. Similar to how all the major assassin items grant 20 out of combat movement speed, all the marksmen items should grant \"+X whatever\" where \"whatever\" is something that makes the marksmen's damage a little more agnostic.\n\n---- EDIT\n\nI'd like to point out that a while back it was said that crit is supposed to be the \"class bound\" marksmen stat. In that case, crit should serve the primary function that marksmen are designed for. In other words, critical strikes should be about ignoring a ton of  resistances, not doing double damage. I'm just throwing some ideas around though.\n\nReally if you take anything away from this, take away that its not marksmen, its marksmen items that needs changing.","replies":[{"poster":"Treyhova","date":"2017-01-06T16:20:12.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A big offender of generally worthless marksmen items is {{item:3153}}.

Its not even the extra gold. Its the combination of two main things; Raptor Camp, and Jungle respawn time. If you create larger amounts of time where you literally cannot farm the jungle, YOU FORCE THEM to gank or counterjungle. Every single jungle streamer agrees the raptor camp is fucking insane. The overwhelming majority of junglers right now have to buy tiamat just because of it (and to a smaller extent Krugs). \n\nThe entire role is basically dictated by being a jungler who can A) Do enough AOE to deal with the Raptor Camp, which cuts the viable champions signifigantly. B) Do good single target damage, as blue and red buff are now only single target, so aoe champs are less effective against it. And C) Be able to gank early. You cant afk farm the jungle earlier as i said, so champions like Master Yi feel like hot garbage trying to gank pre6.\n\nAlso, the changes to masteries are problematic. Champions like Olaf who are tanks without hard CC cannot take COTC, forcing them to pick thunderlords or fervor. Other tanks such as Garen face this same problem. If your a tank who cant tank courage, youre not performing that well most likely (even though Olaf is relatively decent at the moment due to the influx of control mages who rely on cc to peel). Taking out SOTA only furthers this issue, as champions like Nidalee basically required the mastery to function.
