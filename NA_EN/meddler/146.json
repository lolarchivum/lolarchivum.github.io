The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Some 8.8 stuff**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;re working on a number of things for 8.8 and also working on midseason right now. Couple of lists below as a result that split 8.8 into things highly likely to happen and things we&#039;re hoping to look at but may or may not get to depending on how other work goes.\r\n \r\nLikely to ship:\r\n \r\n* The kill streak bounty changes previously mentioned (solo gold instead of team)\r\n* Kit adjustments as previously discussed to Leblanc and Ahri.\r\n* Some trinket adjustments. At the least we&#039;ll be making it so Oracle&#039;s is available from level 1 instead of Sweeping Lens. Original reason to not to that was concern at how much lane brush control it would offer, we believe we can address that by having the Oracle&#039;s duration scale by level. Also considering some other possible things, including yellow trinket wards having a longer lifespan and longer CD (give a longer period of safety when you do use them, need to be a bit more deliberate about when that is however).  \r\n* A Tahm Kench nerf aimed at giving opponents more ways to deal with him when he&#039;s saving allies. What we&#039;re currently testing is that he no longer gains bonus movement speed when moving towards enemies if he has an ally devoured. Original intent was that that would encourage more aggressive ally devour cases. It mainly seems to result in TK running away faster because there&#039;s often an enemy along the line of his retreat (or close enough to, the directional check&#039;s pretty generous in its angles).\r\n \r\nSmaller balance adjustments (or at least investigations) if time permits. Not all of these will happen and some of those that do will show up later in the patch cycle:\r\n \r\n* Buffs to Pantheon (post minion agro changes), Spellbinder Orb (underperforming compared to comparable AP options), Nautilus (needs larger work too, but is also just weak), Vi\r\n* Nerfs to Archangel&#039;s (new build path and stats have made this a bit strong), Janna, Xayah, Caitlyn, Warwick, Braum, Sion, Kog (though also need to see where Rageblade nerfs in 8.7 leave him)\r\n \r\nMight also be some midseason changes we pull forwards from 8.10 to 8.8 to test a few things earlier, still figuring that out though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Varus**\r\n \r\nA few of you might remember a change to Varus I talked about around a year ago that never ended up happening which would involve changing a bit of his kit&#039;s functionality. Was intended to ship around the same time as the addition of the Attack Speed ratio to his passive, ended up getting delayed repeatedly however because it needed visual effects/sound changes and other things were higher priority. We finally had a chance to get round to doing that art/audio work though, so will have that change in 8.8. That change is the addition of an active to his W that looks like this at rank 1.\r\n \r\nActive: Varus&#039; next Piercing Arrow deals bonus magic damage equal to 6% to 9% of the target&#039;s missing health (scales with Piercing Arrow charge). 40s CD. No mana cost.\r\n \r\n \r\nMagic damage scales up to 12%-18% by W rank. It&#039;s still going through final balancing, so numbers aren&#039;t final. First goal is to ensure that, no matter what his build is, some of Varus&#039;s Q shots are still really impactful. Second is to offer an additional skill test, rewarding those who can call the shots that are both most important and likely to hit (long CD means you need to pick the right Q). \r\n \r\nThis change does add some power to Varus, so depending on where he ends up after the Rageblade cost increase in 8.7 might take a bit of power out elsewhere. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**No posts for a couple of weeks**\r\n \r\nI&#039;m going to be out of the office for a couple of weeks so I won&#039;t be able to do these posts for a bit, apologies. Should be back mid April.\r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Crocodilo Maroto","date":"2018-03-30T16:02:13.335+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":76,"body":"What about Lissandra?

TK is good or at least valued in competitive play due to his reliability in saving allies. This is understandable but I don't like the \"River King\" being pigeonholed into the support role. I want Riot to officially support him as a jungler too. I'm happy that you guys have tried doing this with Ekko to an extent even if he's not quite there yet. Everything about Kench's lore and kit screams \"jungler\" to me. I bought him and fell in love with him when he was a GOOD jungler (before his mini rework). His kit is overall pretty good for a jungler (except the falling off due to a lack of AoE). The biggest issues are his atrocious clear and high mana costs. Allowing the increasing bonus damage with 3 stacks to work in the jungle would instantly make him viable. \n\n2. If you're trying to balance properly and keep champions viable at all brackets, it should be clear that WW isn't the issue. His win rate is a reflection of careless players failing to adapt. He excels in SQ but isn't objectively that strong (you'd see him a lot in competitive and top 10 Challenger if that were the case). A lot of his cheese, such as doing the enemy top JG @1:15 wouldn't even work there. Moreover, he doesn't have the mechanical demands of something like Lee Sin and thus, his win rate isn't dragged down by bad mains. He's also a generalist jungler that fits most comps. so again, this will artificially make his average win rate higher despite him not being OP. His passive alone helps weak junglers understand what to do better and building tanky means he'll never be completely useless if he messes up (unlike a Rengar, Kha etc.). Even when he's perfectly balanced, he's likely to have an above average win rate. While he has a 43% ban rate in NA, that drops to 1.3% when you look at KR. He's a predictable champion with clear weaknesses. People too often play into his dueling & skirmishing strength while not respecting his early (or adjusting against it by taking different JG paths). \n\nSome tips: Grievous wounds, splitting less/more carefully, kiting & disengaging properly (saving CC for R), not hanging around at low HP,  warding his JG (he doesn't have the flexibility over walls of a Kha or Sej), and not giving him an early lead. Everything about WW becomes so much more awesome with an early lead. His healing becomes difficult to deal with if you don't have time to get grievous wounds, his tankiness becomes overpowering and he can start to dive. WW's Tiamat dependence for proper farming is one of his balance levers and this is negated as well. Random early leads are the way WWs dominate. WW can't properly farm Krugs or Raptors and yet he frequently gets a kill top ~2:45 after 3 camps. This gank timing is so common and reliable. That's not WW being strong as much as players being bad. Nerfing WW in any sizeable capacity appeases bad players at the cost of true balance and viability through the entire skill tier. It's a band aid fix that makes your game objectively worse just to shut up some whiners who refuse to learn. Vs competent teams, he's already very hard to pilot properly late game so at the very least his scaling shouldn't be made worse. Right now, he's good just because he's a snowball champion with a high chance of actually snowballing. His whole kit is built around it with his passive, R, E, duelist & skirmishing kit with minimal teamfight effectiveness etc. How can you NOT expect that he will have a good winrate especially in weaker regions? That doesn't make him OP. If you want to nerf him for average players, at least provide something more for skilled players to compensate at the highest tiers.  \n\n3. I enjoyed Kog as an AP mid in Season 4. He's not really viable there anymore. Again, if you nerf him, I'd like to at least have his secondary role be more powerful. ADC Kog is just boring to me but I doubt he'll be strong after the Rageblade nerf (outside of the Lulu pairing).\n\nI don't play the others enough to have many opinions. \n\nI just want a balanced game I can rely on and not this non-stop band-aiding whenever the whining gets loud enough or win rates go up. Win rates don't mean shit by themselves unless they're dramatically out of line. Even then and when a champion has a good pick rate, it may still be just that the skill floor is low so people don't screw it up so badly but a champion's strength should really be judged by the skill ceiling (aka as optimal play). That's the real test and that's how you create a balanced game that doesn't need futile band aids every few weeks... the holes in such a strategy will inevitably leak because it's 100% unsustainable and wrong. If you manage to do that and aim for it, people could just accept they suck and it isn't really the balance holding them back. Doing the opposite of this just makes players arrogant and always expecting that anything with a higher winrate gets gutted regardless of the objective balance state or reasons. They don't even bother to adapt besides banning. They expect hand holding. They don't try to think \"why am I actually losing to this champion? what are the weaknesses/strengths? how do I adapt to his strategies/kit? etc.\" People want you to balance around the \"majority of players\" but the majority of players don't know shit about the game or balance. I played a normal game and people were complaining about how OP Garen is because of his ult. is... these are the people you want to listen to? They're good only to understand what most people find fun. Would you pick your heart surgeon or systems architect randomly off the street just because they're the \"majority?\" That's how a game is ruined. If people could just trust that Riot were focused on objective balancing around optimal play - not because Riot cares about competitive more but because that's literally what balance is. You don't balance around someone making a ton of mistakes... that's just useless. What if every chess game I started 1. h4 2. h5 3. h6 and then predictably white had an awful winrate. Would we now give White 2 moves at the start to compensate for this bad play? No one can take a game seriously and invest in learning it at a higher level if they can't trust that balance is being done properly and that the game actually has depth.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyon913","date":"2018-03-31T06:25:35.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"You basically state the reasons why Warwick needs a nerf in your reasons for why he doesn't.

Mid game is the most crucial period of time in League, where a big skirmish can completely change the tides of a game.

There's no such thing as \"overtuned in low ELOs.\" There's only overtuned or not. If a champion is balanced at high skill play but overperforms at lower rungs, it's not because the champion is overtuned at lower tiers. It's because those players fail to correctly play against him. This is a skill issue and not a champion issue. The champion is the constant in the equation. What isn't is the players. What you're asking for isn't balance; it's literally exemptions from proper balance because a strategy/champion etc. is not something that you or your teammates are competent in dealing with. Thus, you want Riot to step in and nerf that thing. \n\nThis is a toxic mentality for long-term game health  and detracts from it as an e-sport/competitive game since it actually pushes to move away from the reality of the objective balance state. It's an egoic reaction. It would be as if I got hit by every Ziggs skillshot and thus Riot changed the game for me to compensate for my lack of ability in dodging. Thus, Ziggs' AP ratios would be obliterated by 40% and now I'd be equally matched with a 50% winrate vs my opponent. Meanwhile, the game is ruined for skilled players and a lot of its strategic depth is too since Ziggs is no longer viable once people start playing more correctly. A strategic option was removed and now we've narrowed the viable options to win for someone who dedicates more time to this game and has a higher skill level. The game might be more fun for me now because I feel like I have a fair chance to win vs Ziggs but it objectively turned to shit and once I improve, I will also realize it's shit and that this type of balance mentality is unsustainable/cripples the vast majority of the roster. If you want a good game, don't ask for exceptions. Demand objective balance instead. To have this, a champion needs to be balanced around its strongest exponents, not the average player. \n\nAlternatively, you can have multiple versions of the whole game. One for competitive (perhaps even with a pure solo ladder at the top 1000) and one for casuals (even if ranked). Maybe there can be a version of LoL with a separate ranking system that has this sort of objective balance philosophy and you can move from one to the other kind of like you can switch from Flex to Solo. The other version would be geared more towards appeasing whatever the average player finds most frustrating/is performing worst against etc. Riot is trying REALLY HARD to do both in one game and it's a strategy for failure long-term... as it is beginning to become clear I think even to them. You cannot do both well. You can half-ass it and not please anyone or you can do things well but pick one way/have multiple versions of the ranking system etc. Serious players don't appreciate hand-holding balance fixes and casuals feel that the serious players get too much attention compared to the pros. They think that because they're the majority, they're automatically right (not even a little true) and that the balance should be for them - screwing over those who actually care about the game at a deeper level and want exciting competition with a diverse array of picks & strategies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirLime","date":"2018-03-31T08:13:35.596+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lyon913,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=na3Ko02t,comment-id=005f0002,timestamp=2018-03-31T06:25:35.423+0000)\n>\n> You basically state the reasons why Warwick needs a nerf in your reasons for why he doesn&#x27;t.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not trying to say the game shouldn&#x27;t cater to Pro Players and Challengers in some aspects, but Riot isn&#x27;t obliged to do that 100% of the time at the complete detriment of most of their player base.\n> \n> Addressing your Grievous Wounds point, completely finishing a Morellonomicon, or getting an Executioner&#x27;s Calling just for WW can be really inconvenient...and might also be completely useless. Here&#x27;s why- generally speaking, the champs that buy these items are also the ones that WW tries to ult onto. So in almost every case a QSS would be much more useful than the above mentioned items. Having to buy 2 separate expensive components on an ADC for items they won&#x27;t finish until much later in the game is unreasonable and will probably cause that team to autolose because the ADC will do no damage. \n> \n> Obviously I&#x27;m just theorizing in a vacuum here, but that&#x27;s exactly the same thing you&#x27;re doing. Only you&#x27;re going against the actual statistics and winrates that show he&#x27;s had high winrates across multiple elos(for quite a while), while I&#x27;m trying to show ways why WW might be strong, which agrees with the numbers.\n> \n> Also your comments about having a &quot;perfectly balanced game&quot; without &quot;band-aids&quot; is just another way of saying you want a stale game that never changes and just stays the same. That sounds really boring to me. I love the fact that the meta shakes up every once in a while. I appreciate the active effort Riot takes to shake it up. If the game never changes, pro teams would eventually &quot;solve&quot; the game, and play in the most optimal way to win every game since they now have ample time to do so. This optimal path would trickle down from Challenger to Bronze and the game would slowly become much more monotonous, with everyone knowing what they should do, what the enemy should do et cetera, until all the life is sucked from this game.\n\n\nIf you had perfect balance, the game wouldn't be stale because you wouldn't be directed towards certain OP champs, strategies and setups. There would be no optimal strategy to trickle down from Challenger since you'd see the whole roster played and many different ways to win. You'd be free to execute any strategy without crippling your chance to win long-term (although even there people would gravitate towards the easiest to execute strategies to achieve that). The \"freshness\" you talk about is somewhat artificial because what happens is that a stale figured out meta generally just replaces the previous one with time. Change for the sake of change is not a good motto for game design. Essentially, instead of X being the dominant strategy, it just becomes Y. The game doesn't actually become better; it just becomes more novel. You're still pushed in a certain direction by the balance decisions and aren't so free to explore if you care about results. \n\nPerfect balance is almost impossible so it's not like Riot wouldn't change the game anymore and occasionally there would still be large design changes for the direction of the game, items, classes etc. Also, perfect balance could indeed mean that the game is exciting at the highest tiers but more clear cut at low ELOS (which is already true to an extent). For example, let's say Garen was made viable at the highest ELOs but now had a 57% winrate in Silver. This would kind of suck and I wouldn't be surprised if that's how the winrates wound up were Garen to be viable everywhere. Thus, in this case, maybe Garen would be the highest average winrate top at low ELO and so people there would \"figure out\" that it's the best way to climb, at least for a bit and if you're not particularly skilled at any other champion. However, it would be just the lowest effort and most reliable way of climbing. Someone who figures out let's say Camille could be just as successful but would need to spend more time understanding her. Eventually, the Garen player won't be able to just rely on the ease of the champion to maintain a solid winrate and climb. He'll need to update his game knowledge too and Garen's winrate will drop as he goes to new skill tiers.\n\nThis is basically the worst case scenario of objective balance but is it really so terrible to have specific metas at various skill brackets as long as you know that nothing is actually OP? These metas wouldn't be locked or enforced by anyone. Players would understand that the game is balanced around what's actually true and it's their skill level holding them back. They'd realize that blaming balance doesn't make much sense because all those picks are very viable even at higher tiers/competitive. Or at least, that's what should happen but it does require a level of trust when their experiences are different. For example, if you see yourself lose to Yi a lot in Bronze, you might think he's OP even if he never outperforms in competitive. It would take some adjustment of player attitudes.\n\nThe higher winrate champions at lower brackets would just reflect  what a player there can execute more reliably and successfully. It wouldn't be as if other strategies are actually dwarfed by the dominant meta. The game would thrive at top level with a multitude of strategies and picks (although probably trending to what's more reliable). Thus, if let's say the low ELO meta is all deathball comps. with Garen, Annie, Yi and Jinx, so be it.  What players would be annoyed about I suppose is just that \"hey, X player got to this ELO easier than I did because of his champion\" etc. This would probably lead to jokes about being a Garen main and possibly some devaluing of rank in people's eyes if mid ELO was reached with some champion known to outperform there. I'd rather have this sacrifice than to mess with the integrity of objective balance.  The Garen main would be stuck eventually too if he doesn't have sufficient game knowledge. Since people would never feel handicapped by their champions, they can just have fun with whatever they like. It might make the game less serious at lower ranks (which may even make it more fun for the average player) while being FAR better and less stale at higher ranks (D5+). People below Gold are unlikely to even now be handicapped by balance decisions THAT much and nor do they care about that a great deal. Meanwhile, the higher ELO players do care and are directly affected by balance. It can negate a large portion of what they want to play. If Gragas is garbage but you're a great Gragas, you're still going to be able to climb from Bronze to Silver. In neither balance philosophy, are champion picks truly the limiting factor at lower ELOs and improving the situation at lower ELOs won't be as appreciated as higher anyway (lower ELO players have other priorities and don't tend to be as dedicated anyway). \n\nIn the objective balance situation, someone playing Tryndamere especially well would still have no trouble climbing with a split-push strategy in low ELO and also wouldn't be handicapped at the highest levels. The difference would just be in comparative effort to learn. However, they'd always have just as much of a chance to climb to the level of their competence with sufficient time. This is not such a bad scenario and far better than now where you actually have to dump champs you like because they're not meta. Try playing Garen in Masters+ or Gragas anywhere but low ELO :p. In the problematic scenario with objective balance, what holds people back is skill but they can do something about that if they want. In the current one, sufficiently skilled players are constrained by the balance decisions themselves and not just their own ability to perform. Balancing for lower tiers warps balance and doesn't give a good foundation for gameplay. It's trying to build something on quick sand because truth and reality weren't at the core.\n\nI'm a bit tired and I'm sure this is super rambling and confusing. Sorry but I hope you get the gist of it. I'm pretty convinced that objective balance is the best way long-term or that the game should be split into two different sets of balance rules for casuals and for serious players but this post is probably not best at explaining exactly why.\n\nBTW: Even if everything is perfectly equitable below Plat 1, just the fact that competitive currently only shows a very limited pool/strategic repertoire is likely to discourage players from going something like Garen or Ziggs. Like you said, the Challenger players do have some influence on what is favored at lower ELOs too even if it might not improve their performance to pick a champion that might be a tad stronger at an objective level. Thus, if you have a healthy meta with a lot of variety at top level, it's also likely to make the game more interesting at lower levels. Although, champions won't appeal equally even if balanced perfectly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SirLime","date":"2018-03-30T23:25:31.993+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=astralwit,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=na3Ko02t,comment-id=005f,timestamp=2018-03-30T19:43:06.165+0000)\n>\n> 1. TK is good or at least valued in competitive play due to his reliability in saving allies. This is understandable but I don&#x27;t like the &quot;River King&quot; being pigeonholed into the support role. I want Riot to officially support him as a jungler too. I&#x27;m happy that you guys have tried doing this with Ekko to an extent even if he&#x27;s not quite there yet. Everything about Kench&#x27;s lore and kit screams &quot;jungler&quot; to me. I bought him and fell in love with him when he was a GOOD jungler (before his mini rework). His kit is overall pretty good for a jungler (except the falling off due to a lack of AoE). The biggest issues are his atrocious clear and high mana costs. Allowing the increasing bonus damage with 3 stacks to work in the jungle would instantly make him viable. \n> \n> 2. If you&#x27;re trying to balance properly and keep champions viable at all brackets, it should be clear that WW isn&#x27;t the issue. His win rate is a reflection of careless players failing to adapt. He excels in SQ but isn&#x27;t objectively that strong (you&#x27;d see him a lot in competitive and top 10 Challenger if that were the case). A lot of his cheese, such as doing the enemy top JG @1:15 wouldn&#x27;t even work there. Moreover, he doesn&#x27;t have the mechanical demands of something like Lee Sin and thus, his win rate isn&#x27;t dragged down by bad mains. He&#x27;s also a generalist jungler that fits most comps. so again, this will artificially make his average win rate higher despite him not being OP. His passive alone helps weak junglers understand what to do better and building tanky means he&#x27;ll never be completely useless if he messes up (unlike a Rengar, Kha etc.). Even when he&#x27;s perfectly balanced, he&#x27;s likely to have an above average win rate. While he has a 43% ban rate in NA, that drops to 1.3% when you look at KR. He&#x27;s a predictable champion with clear weaknesses. People too often play into his dueling &amp; skirmishing strength while not respecting his early (or adjusting against it by taking different JG paths). \n> \n> Some tips: Grievous wounds, splitting less/more carefully, kiting &amp; disengaging properly (saving CC for R), not hanging around at low HP,  warding his JG (he doesn&#x27;t have the flexibility over walls of a Kha or Sej), and not giving him an early lead. Everything about WW becomes so much more awesome with an early lead. His healing becomes difficult to deal with if you don&#x27;t have time to get grievous wounds, his tankiness becomes overpowering and he can start to dive. WW&#x27;s Tiamat dependence for proper farming is one of his balance levers and this is negated as well. Random early leads are the way WWs dominate. WW can&#x27;t properly farm Krugs or Raptors and yet he frequently gets a kill top ~2:45 after 3 camps. This gank timing is so common and reliable. That&#x27;s not WW being strong as much as players being bad. Nerfing WW in any sizeable capacity appeases bad players at the cost of true balance and viability through the entire skill tier. It&#x27;s a band aid fix that makes your game objectively worse just to shut up some whiners who refuse to learn. Vs competent teams, he&#x27;s already very hard to pilot properly late game so at the very least his scaling shouldn&#x27;t be made worse. Right now, he&#x27;s good just because he&#x27;s a snowball champion with a high chance of actually snowballing. His whole kit is built around it with his passive, R, E, duelist &amp; skirmishing kit with minimal teamfight effectiveness etc. How can you NOT expect that he will have a good winrate especially in weaker regions? That doesn&#x27;t make him OP. If you want to nerf him for average players, at least provide something more for skilled players to compensate at the highest tiers.  \n> \n> 3. I enjoyed Kog as an AP mid in Season 4. He&#x27;s not really viable there anymore. Again, if you nerf him, I&#x27;d like to at least have his secondary role be more powerful.

Even then and when a champion has a good pick rate, it may still be just that the skill floor is low so people don&#x27;t screw it up so badly but a champion&#x27;s strength should really be judged by the skill ceiling (aka as optimal play). That&#x27;s the real test and that&#x27;s how you create a balanced game that doesn&#x27;t need futile band aids every few weeks... the holes in such a strategy will inevitably leak because it&#x27;s 100% unsustainable and wrong. If you manage to do that and aim for it, people could just accept they suck and it isn&#x27;t really the balance holding them back. Doing the opposite of this just makes players arrogant and always expecting that anything with a higher winrate gets gutted regardless of the objective balance state or reasons. They don&#x27;t even bother to adapt besides banning. They expect hand holding. They don&#x27;t try to think &quot;why am I actually losing to this champion? what are the weaknesses/strengths? how do I adapt to his strategies/kit? etc.&quot; People want you to balance around the &quot;majority of players&quot; but the majority of players don&#x27;t know shit about the game or balance. I played a normal game and people were complaining about how OP Garen is because of his ult. is... these are the people you want to listen to? They&#x27;re good only to understand what most people find fun. Would you pick your heart surgeon or systems architect randomly off the street just because they&#x27;re the &quot;majority?&quot; That&#x27;s how a game is ruined. If people could just trust that Riot were focused on objective balancing around optimal play - not because Riot cares about competitive more but because that&#x27;s literally what balance is. You don&#x27;t balance around someone making a ton of mistakes... that&#x27;s just useless. What if every chess game I started 1. h4 2. h5 3. h6 and then predictably white had an awful winrate. Would we now give White 2 moves at the start to compensate for this bad play? No one can take a game seriously and invest in learning it at a higher level if they can&#x27;t trust that balance is being done properly and that the game actually has depth.\n\nThe only Ekko JG that can be viable but still not amazing is bruiser (some AP but also tank stats). A melee diving champion as a jungler on a low income budget is just never going to work out in the average game. Riot might not like for Ekko JG to be tanky but he does have high mana costs which make it less attractive and yet it's still the only way for him to go when not snowballing. It also messes up your team comp. if your jungler goes a champion like Ekko and gives nothing to your team comp. that Rengar or Shaco can't. The whole point of Ekko is to be a more subtle diving assassin with CC and outplay potential. To actually benefit from this realistically, he needs fights to be long enough for those things to matter. For that, he can't be 3 shot and die or panic ult. ... he needs time to position and to go in/out of the fight. That's why despite what Riot wants, the best Ekko will always require some tanky stats - even in mid lane. Kassadin is similar. He needs at least something like RoA for tanky stats. It's not wrong or unhealthy. It's forced on you if those champions are to be useful. I hate feeling like when I play a champion like Ekko as HIS KIT IS - bruiser, I am afraid of it getting gutted again. Unless he's going to be a cheese champion, even better AP ratios won't make him viable as full AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wobaji","date":"2018-03-30T22:00:49.157+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=astralwit,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=na3Ko02t,comment-id=005f,timestamp=2018-03-30T19:43:06.165+0000)\n>\n> 1.
