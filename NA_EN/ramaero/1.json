Talon kit could be improved sure, but in no way should that be a revert. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nTalon after the assassin update became less one dimensional and had something more unique to him as an assassin, not to mention damage wise he has an overall higher potential damage output in teamfights especially considering you can trigger bleed on multiple targets(although very difficult to do in certain teamfights but that is his potential), and despite it not being a blink and slightly less range his gap closing q has a shorter cooldown than his old E and his new Q has a chance to be reset if u kill the target, which I try to set up with certain combos/situations so I can have that ready to be used again soon, but many times that just happens without me having to think about it. And that is just me talking about his Q and his passive, I haven't even mentioned his E, which not even going to bother going into why that is an amazing improvement to his kit that helps in him overall having good roaming pressure over the map, in addition to helping in escapes and engages.\n\nIf you know how to utilize his strengths after the assassin update well he is by far better, and in my opinion his gameplay is much more enjoyable. The old Talon is highly overrated, and I really wish people would see that objectively. Talon should not be \"reverted\", and if there is any change to be made, it should be an update to his kit kind of like how Xin had one not too long ago. I have of a well thought out and in depth update to his kit that would fit well with Talon's identity as a champion, diversify his playstyle more from the other assassins, and increase his skill ceiling.

I don't wish for him to have a Katarina-esque skill ceiling, but it would be nice if his kit revolved around more than \"parkour in, one-shot single target, parkour away\". It's not interesting, and honestly there just doesn't seem to be meaningful ways of skill-expression in his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-04-25T19:31:04.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feast or famine and if you have an assassin like character it will always be that way.\n\nAtleast give me the fun version.

Old talon was braindead and required very little skill to stomp when ahead (getting ahead is another story, of course). New talon actually requires an understanding of macro and how to end a game to play properly. The silvers/golds asking for a revert just want their low-skill, poorly designed stomp-in-lowelo champ back.\n\nThe new talon doesnt require skills more than the old. Also the only ones enjoying new talon are silver bronze because no one side step talon w so they get bursted try to play vs plats diamonds and see how effective he is compared to all the other assassins","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2018-04-24T19:27:19.419+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"i just want talons cut throat back thats all i want ","replies":[]},{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-04-24T22:04:03.292+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"If Riot does anything that isn't just number changes to Talon, they should make his E a mini-dash similar to Riven's E and if it collides with terrain, he leaps over it.
