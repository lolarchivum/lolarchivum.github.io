Now she is completely broken and not in the good way. Her ult is what was crucial in every single ability she has. Max range ult would just barely hit people, slowing them enough for you to wall them at max range or hit q with the very tip. Now that her ult has been so badly nerfed her whole kit is less than satisfactory. \r\n\r\nReason why I believe they would change her ult to grow - wave clear is too strong and distance was too overwhelming perhaps? But honestly it has been completely gutted. She strives when the opposing team is out of position and now, she feels so under-tuned to what her identity was. Slow burst mage that capitalizes on positioning.\r\n\r\n A reasonable fix to her ult  would be to double the rate of expansion. It takes 3 seconds to fully grow from 150 to 550 radius (was 400 before). to cast her ult is 75 mana, per second is 50 mana. It takes 225 mana for it to be full size. The problem isnt the mana its the rate at which it grows. Most fights you will never let the storm go full size because of 1. Kiting, 2. CC (any form of CC will interrupt her ult) 3. Cooldown doesnt start until you cancel your ult. In my opinion, her ult should grow to full radius in 2 seconds, cooldown START on cast, and keep &quot;Final Form&quot; but reduce the AP ratio on her ultimate.\r\n\r\nIf the above isnt ideal then perhaps just change the starting radius from 150 to 300, reaches full 550 radius in 2.5 seconds (instead of 3). Reduce ap ratio on ultimate.\r\n\r\nOr possibly change the full radius to 650 radius in the full 3 seconds with reduced ap ratio.\r\n\r\nReference.\r\n&quot; new FINAL FORM At maximum size, Glacial Storm&rsquo;s damage, chill duration and slow are increased by 50% &quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nThank you,","replies":[{"poster":"Alüe","date":"2016-05-05T22:29:19.868+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"upvoting solely because i understand how it feels to have such a small impact radius with your ult #ridiculousskillshots\nXerath main","replies":[{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2016-05-06T14:57:32.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alüe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZR2gwsTl,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-05T22:29:19.868+0000)\n>\n> upvoting solely because i understand how it feels to have such a small impact radius with your ult #ridiculousskillshots\n> Xerath main\n\nWhile I understand his ult has a small hit box it also has a huge range, and multiple hits to reward skillful use \n\nAnivias ult is worse in the aspect that it's got an extremely short range in comparison and she is just a squishy as xerath\n\nCombined this with its utility not being that great and it causes a problem for her to even try to get close enough to use it. Then add in the mobility creep and most enemies will be able to dash out of it before it becomes effective, and that dash usually means onto anivia to break her egg and then scrabble it\n\nThe starting radius is so small that any dash in the game can be used to get out of it\n\nThis nerf might have been reasonable if her R also grounded the target (preventing dash and flash) while inside of it because then it would be truely be able to fulfil it's Job of being a powerful zoning not tool, but as of now it feels weak, is easily avoided by anyone with a dash (still not hard to just walk out of it either), can be easily interrupted, and by the time it reaches full growth the fight has usually already moved to a new spot\n\nThings they should change to make it better (since though it is gutted it does make more counter play for the enemy which is healthy game design)\n\n1. R now also grounds any targets inside of it (seperate effect from the chill)\n2. If you land a critical E while R is channeling R will instantly grow to full size\n3. R at full size also prevents targets from dashing through it (think poppy W)\n\nWhy you ask? The change to R offers much more counter play, the issue is they didn't buff the ability for this bonus counter play in a meaningful way, they slow bonus after charged doesn't really do much because the fight is already gone from her R, look at the Taric change to stun, it was single target point and click to an aoe stun with a delay, that was proper compensation tontaric for makinng it have much more counter play (which is what happened to anivia without proper compensation)\n\nThe changes I have proposed will make anivia able to skillfully outplay her opponent while still giving counter play but make her abilities feel rewarding for properly using them\n\nR would now have a way to instantly grow if you can land the small radius R or Q, then E while R is channeling to make it instantly grow, and it is now an effective \"my zone\" tool for anivia because while inside of it she will have faster MS than her enemy due to the slow and they cannot dash on her\n\n\"But that's overloaded\" an ability that has huge counter play should be powerful, after all the counter play to her R is\n\nCC her\nDodge her E crit by avoiding chilled from R or Q\nGet out of it and move the fight elsewhere or wait for her to stop it due to mana drain\nForce her away from it because she can't move it at will and it will have to regrow\nKill her\nGo around it\n\nAlso note the instant growth requires at least 2 spells to cause and if you dodge her R she now has to use her defensive utility Q to try and make E crit for the instant growth \n\nThe problem isn't that they made her R have more counter play, the issue is they made it feel underwealming even when used skillfully and outplaying your opponent","replies":[{"poster":"Alüe","date":"2016-05-06T20:45:58.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the same with xerath except in the matter that it is impossible to land his skill shots at higher elo.

Point and click, sure, but look at Annie who can do a hell of a lot more damage with the same gold (post 1st back). Toxic counterplay is where you can't do anything against the opponent, but she actually had lots of inherent weaknesses pre-6.9, especially if she lost lane early. Building just a tiny bit of MR makes Anivia's time that much harder because she had to prioritize 2 mana items before getting to AP or penetration (and she can't just get them both unless she's super fed... and any champion is super strong when they're super fed). Shutting her down early with cc ganks basically wins the game right there because she has no egg and no mana if she tries to rush some AP hoping for a miracle.\n\nI also disagree that her ult was used for only a critical strike E, because I would often set up a wall + ult behind a surprised enemy to force flashes in many of my ranked games. And it is incredibly useful for catch potential, which she no longer has save her wall.\n\nShe's basically unplayable now to the likes of just about every other mid lane mage, and she now lacks in sieging and counter-sieging which is what she has always been picked for.

However, that intended use scenario is not seen as often as you're trying to make people believe. The vast majority of R use is to proc E, even at low levels of play. Only 2-3 R's per game are used for more than 1 second when fighting champions, because the free E proc is all most people care about.\n\nAlso, the mobility argument is okay when considering mobility, but remember that things that beat mobility or help against it (point and click in particular) tends to fuck over non-mobility even harder.

I'm not saying this new Anivia is healthier or better or anything, just talking about old anivia.\nThere's a character with one ability that relies on two others. One of the two is a slow moving dodgeable skillshot, the other is a pretty much guaranteed hit. Unless you're facing a very mobile character, you're pretty much guaranteed the E crit. Does this sound healthy?\n\nAssuming the opponent also has a way to shoot back, which most midlaners do, then it comes down to who can do more damage in the trade. Understand where I'm going with this? If you can trade back, you HAVE to have more damage output than her. Else, she walks up to you and it's a guaranteed won trade on her end. Does this sound healthy?\n\nSo, if you don't have enough burst, the counterplay is stay out of range. It's not hard to stay out of range... Except that's some pretty hard zoning. Do you think \"Stay out of range\" is healthy? What if you're a melee mid? Do you just accept the dick and farm whatever meager supply of minions reaches your tower? \n\nThe combination of all of the above makes Anivia super unhealthy in every scenario.

If you have enough mobility to avoid her guaranteed combo, you're probably playing Leblanc or Zed so fuck you.

I still suggest that changes happen.\"\n\n I hope for changes as well, but those would look like buffs to you ( all i want it her to be her old self) \n\n\"Getting in your target's aa range is not a skill based thing.\"\n\nIt is, if your enemy has means to stop you from doing so. If you are able to dodge this abilitites and get to your enemy to do dmg. Dodging abilities is considered skill. ( It it something palyers love about mobility, only that with dodging while moving a little is not that exciting) \n\n\"Ever played Nunu top? I think you know where I'm going with this.\"\n\nNo, and I would not know if I havent read your comment 3 times by now ( my pc crashed so I had to redo this comment btw.) \n\n\"If you didn't get in aa range it's because they have the means to counter attack you.\"\nJep, thats why it is skill to get past those counters. They have means to stop me with better range, if i manage to dodge those I won the trade, if i get hit I lost. Thats the risk behind every trade against higher ranged/cc champions. And that is considered skill. \n\n\"Don't fool yourself, that isn't skill.\"\n\nEvery zed , yi, leblanc and yasuo would disagree with you. They are quite proud of their ability to doge your counteratacks. \n\n\"Don't fool yourself, that isn't skill. That's knowing they can't fight back hard enough.\"\n\nUsualy I face enemies that have the ability to do so. Every trade is a test between you and the enemy whether they can outplay you or not. Even more so if they have different atackranges.\n\n \"I guess Nunu is just as skillful, huh? \"\n\nMaybe, maybe not. Wheter he actualy tries to doge or not is quite irelevant for him at some point. Explanation below:\n\n\" His range is lower, after all. He's putting himself in even more danger! \"\n\nIt is, but he is definetly more tanky ( not early on and depending on the build ). But more importantly, he can heal himself quite often and without any manacosts . \n\nAnother diference is, you dont have to face enemies toplane which would outrange you as much as they do midlane. Melee, or close range enemies like vlad are roaming the top side. \nIn case of melee enemies you are in fact outranging them with your q. If vlad ore someone similiar (like ryze) is your oponent we are having a different situation, but then again he can heal himself. If anivia could trade like she does right now and afterwards have the ability to heal herself that would be op, indeed. But that just is not the case. \n\nYou can not truly compare an ap mage with nunu ( I am not sure which role he actualy has, tanky ap? And more over, Toplane and midlane with entirely different championpools. \n\n\" If being in auto range to use your abilities was ever a dangerous/big concept on its own, assassins and lux players wouldn't exist.\" \n\nAssasins have their mobility and sometimes even dodges ( like yi alpha strike) that deny any kind of cc thrown at them. ( This protext them form e as well) \nThey might dont have the range, but they have gapclosers and their cd's are low and sometimes don't matter to them as much as they matter for ap carries. \n\n\"(The lux example is referring to the fact that most lux players try procing passive in lane, which is auto range).\"\n\nThey usualy do so when their enemy damage skill is on cd or they have snared them ( I played lux , and more over, most classic ap mages on a regular basis, so I know what they do and so on ) \n\nOr in other words: They have done what was necessary to perform such a risk without dieing. ( Or not, then they die.)\n\n \"Anivia's kit still looks and feels incredibly outdated\"\n\nNo ,it dosen't. It got new effects already ( which puts her in front of most champions around )and not only that, but her abilities are working well together with one another and are all necessary to make her a unique and interesting champion with a high risk,high rewarding setup. \n\nAs this came up not the first time, I simply have to ask: What exactly makes her kid seem outdated for you? \nIt's not like her abilities have any marker on them showing that she is one of the oldest champions. I can't see any difference to any other mages speels so I would love to her an explanation for this. (Annie is about the same age and i usualy don't her anyone complain about her kid being outdated) \n\n\"and just because she's your favorite doesn't mean she's immune to changes\"\n\nShe isn't and that should never be the case. Troughout her 6 years, only recently they made changes that actualy impacted her so much. And to my surprise in form of a nerv. ( They once increased her ult speed by 100, then they added a area of effect marker so you could actualy see which area her stun works in. Another was the rangenerv just last year i believe. Those changes where about a Year apart each.) \n\nThey also made a visual update for her entirely ( her Abilities once looked a lot let refined than they do now, and her model got smoothed and refined as well ) \n\nAnd this is a big surprise for me. After 6 Years of a almost entierly untouched record they suddenly change her like this out of nowhere. If you would have such a sight of the things you would realise that it looks like they changed her for the sake of changing, and that is more than upsetting, since there was not realy something wrong with her in my point of view ( and I feel quite confident about this as her changes over such a big time realy are minor until now. \n\nMoreover, they did not even think that they nerved her, they just believed that they gave her more room to work with. They made the stun longer but lowered her dmg slightly, they made the ultimate weaker early on but stronger after 3 seconds. They buffed her aa speed to the level of any other mage ( balanced it to something every other champion of her role already had) and made her e faster which slightly changed her timings for combos. \n\nThis does sound like a buff if you dont play anivia mainly. She relied on the size of her ult as it gave her not only room to work with, but also made multitasking possible and helped her fulfill the role of a utility champion. \n\nDefending the base, pushing, mild cc on the enemy team in case of a teamfight, as engage or disengage. To iniciate her combo. It was a heavy nerv if you think about the strenth they took out of this ability and how much she relied on it. And in a time where manadrain was your worst enemy, if you used your ult a second too long it could have meant a lost fight. ( I was playing with clarity on her until they removed it because it opened up a whole new strategy and I loved it. I never cried about that though because I knew i was the only one who did that, even though I got a lot weaker due to this) \n\n\" especially when she is a stat-check in most lane matchups and relies on bullshit e procs all game to get her damage,\"\n\nIf you think it is bullshit that 2 of her abilities( one is closeranged)  can give you a fair amount of damage you would have to nerv EVERY  damage champion there is because with sydra ulting you into oblivion, annie falshtibering you, malz lauging about his enemy while using r, lux bursting you down completly once you got into a cc longer than 1 second ( i wont listen more as this is ridculous) all of them did nothing but pressing a button and maybe aimed slightly in their atempt to do so. \n\nSometimes it realy sounds like the players wanting her nerved want the e to be removed and instead give them heal or something....  With 2 burst spells, both relying on conditions that are counterable I am realy not sure how this could be considered an issue ( even after explaining it like 4 times in this thread alone) \n\n\" rarely relying on q unless there's a melee champ sticking to her.\"\n\nAnivia relies on it her whole early. And as a gank is something that can happen, using your q to try to hit your enemy can quickly end up in your death. With 16 seconds coldown ( trice her e ) it is not save at all to use, even if you hit your enemy you still have to get e on your enemy and stay out of counteratacks. ( I had a ahri in a recent game that got killed pre level 6, and she still blamed her loose on my r e combo... I did not even had to use my e r all that much against her. She simply could not dodge properly. She claimed anivia was broken, I can only smile when i read that. A few games after that I had an enemy veigar who is usualy quite easy to get. but this one was good and he got me lot more often and would have won if not for his team plying wore than mine. He simply did what you said is not skillbased, get close ( which means he had to dodge my stun ) He outtraded me) \n\n\"Do you think Irelia players should get to avoid a rework just because she has to stay in melee to get her damage out and popular builds leave out early defense?\" \n\nAs most melees she has a potent gap closer and hard cc in form of a stun/slow depending on how she uses it. Also absolute dmg and her ranged ult heals for a fair amount. She was able to erase your whole team solo back then. Easy pentas they said. ( I never had to face such a Irelia myself, and I am thankful for that) \n\nShe dosen't need a rework. Balancing would be all right. I dont have a clue how well she performs right now though. Reowrking is a bad habit of Riotgames. They change champions, sometimes into different roles even ( like malz right now) which is weird if their kid was never a problem to begin with. \nI do understand tweaking of kids or getting rid of toxic abilities like zyras passive ( No champ should have an ability that requires them to die, looking at you karthus/kog' maw( anivia is saved by her passive, so she is not realy diying)) \n\nI would say there are unhealty changes, and there are good /necessary changes. Anivia did not nead to be changed. Tweaking her would have been all right, but forcing her into a role and making her worse in said role is something I wont accept without trying to defend her.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2016-05-06T20:03:56.155+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If R+E is the problem, fix E.

It can be used to: set up an area of damage in a teamfight, clear minion waves, slow retreating or approaching enemies, set up her burst combo, or deny an area to enemies.\n\nAfter these changes, it is no longer useful at most of those things: it can clear minion waves only after you let it grow (at enormous mana cost), it can no longer reliably slow retreating or approaching enemies, and it can no longer reliably set up her burst combo.\n\nAll it's good for now is creating a \"set it and forget it\" area, that can still be disrupted if the enemy hits her with any CC.\n\nTL;DR: If you think Anivia's burst was too high, her E is the real culprit, not the R.

If it weren't for burst enabling, everyone would think the ult is complete garbage... Because it is. It was balanced around the fact that it enables burst. Now imagine E was nerfed to do less damage. Once again, people still consider the ult garbage because burst-enabling isn't worth it, which makes the ult not worth it. Ult and E might as well be just one move. \n\nIf it weren't for the e crit, the ult would be complete shit.

The difference is that last patch, if you got ahead you could be pretty useful for your team. This patch, being ahead doesn't mean as much for Anivia.
