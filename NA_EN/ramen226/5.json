Lets restart from scratch.\n\nELO is a generic name for a ranking system based on a \"elo score\" allowing you to rank people efficiently based on a win lose system. It's mainly used in chess, board games, video games.\n\nMMR is the name RIOT gave to your ELO score and they keep it hidden. MMR = ELO score.\n\nThere is no question of \"elo can be 0 sum in this situation and can\"t in this situation\", elo is a \"SYSTEM\", you can't change the rules of this system without breaking it hard.\n\nNormal have the SAME ranking system as ranked games have, it's just a separate one and it doesnt tell you any fancy division or stuff like \"you are gold, you are plat\", but the real system behind normal mmr and ranked mmr works exactly the same way. If tomorow they want to add a rank to normal game they can do it in the blink of an eye, all the numbers are already there, you just have to display each player's mmr.\n\nLP is never required to be 0 sum, LP and division are just fancy rewards so people can set up fancy goals while playing (at least fancier than saying \"i'm going to aim for 2000 points), it breaks the goals in small steps and give medals to people.\n\nThe best proof LP doesnt follow a 0 sum algorithm is when someone dodges he loses LP and noone wins LPs. \n\nYou can also see that LP can't follow a 0 sum system since there's a shifting to the left in \"LP ranks\" (aka the divisions) at the begining of the season and it pushes people to climb back.\n\ntl;dr : elo = MMR, LP is not 0 sum, you mixed up everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-05-10T14:03:36.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You already said you were done answering, two posts before.

And since people aren't consistently competitive in normals, matchmaking is bound to be less accurate.\n\nNone of that is problem though. That's how it should be. People just need to realize it and deal with it. It's intended to be a less competitive queue, so we should accept that it's gonna be a little less balanced on average.\n\nAuto-losses and stomps are still lame, but if you go into a normal game with lower expectations (like don't base your entire appreciation of the game on the end-result; winning doesn't matter, \"it's just normals\", right?) it can still be somewhat fun. Don't play normals to win. Play them to try something new, or to goof around with friends, or to just get one good fight or make one cool play. Or just follow the advice everyone's heard a million times already, and focus on your own play rather than the game at large. If matchmaking sucked and put you against diamonds, or your team just dicked off all game, whatever; personally you can still do well and have fun (before surrendering at 20), and maybe you'll learn a cool new trick from that diamond player.","replies":[{"poster":"Ramen226","date":"2017-05-07T23:20:09.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand your point that normals are supposed to be less competitive.

I DECIDE the skill level I want to input in my next game. This isnt a move the system can forecast, this isnt a move the most advanced system in the world could forecast. \n\nSure I can't play better than my maximum, but I truly decides if i'll play like a bronze or like a diamond. It's not up to the matchmaking. it's just up to me, the choice of my champion and how much I want to win the game.\n\nWhen I'm in ranked, I'll always choose my mains, and play the best I can. In blind solo queue ? Just depends on my mood. Sometimes i'll just pick my main (veigar) and aim for 1500 ap and I will CRUSH the game, sometimes i'll play soraka with as much lifesteal I can, when i played maybe 10 time soraka in my life. It often ends up with me, my botrk half finished and the ennemy team taking the nexus quite fast.\n\nNow tell me, tell me how any system could solve this problematic. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
