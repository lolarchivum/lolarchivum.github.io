I ended season silver 3 and am silver 1 now. Lol.\n\nAlright, so today when I went to login I was greeted by a nice message:\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/e6c6a2d47d6f94b0b97e39b4910815ac\n\nI thought, oh god, had I become toxic once more ? No, this was not the case, I logged into my dedicated email that has all my LoL accounts attached to it and saw an email I recieved which read this:\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/8b59c947fdcd45852610b80df8f3ce3a\nhttps://gyazo.com/9d2c079eda3e0959fe16a03892728b5a\n\nHmm, strange, I had been caught getting elo boosted ? This made absolutely no sense, as I would never pay someone to Elo boost me in the first place. Now before you jump to conclusions and say, you're clearly lying, heres some facts for you:\n\nI played 916 ranked games this season (Roughly)\nI peaked silver 1 promos to gold several times, unfortunately losing them everytime.\nI hovered between silver 2 and silver 1 for the majority of the season.\nI ended the season silver 3, and just now in the preseason have I hit silver 1 again.\n\nSo I figured I'd send in a support ticket to Riots fabled Player Support, I wrote to them, \"So I just saw I got an Elo boosting email. I'm not quite sure why you guys think i've been elo boosting, I have proof its only been me playing on the account. My friend has streamed every game on (Friends twitch link), and i've only played with him since playing League again. I have no idea why you guys think i've been eloboosted....\"\n\nAnd they responded with this:\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/ffb8ce9654ad7f5b4b4b61e65399837e\n\nI left the supporters name out for privacy reasons. Now, this seemed odd to me, \"Your suspension was only issued after an extensive investigation\", so you extensively investigated my account and saw that I am an average player, who ended the season in the average league, and is still, in the pre season, in the average league. Interesting.\n\nNow, I'm not posting this here to cause drama, I am posting this because I hope they see that they made a mistake and correct that mistake. I would very much like to keep my season rewards and continue play on my account.\n\nEDIT: They responded to my newest ticket with this: \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/a990fd4c321af6cc5c8897cc894e9ca3\n\nSo I guess they will not give me the chance to provide my evidence, nor would it matter is what this agent said. Its so easy to see that I was not in any sense or way boosted. I bet they looked at the ranked games I played before I moved away for school, and then when I moved away. And saw a different IP and then eventually a different MAC. I started to use a laptop instead of my PC. But I still have both, I can willingly provide all MAC's used on the account as well as ALL IP addresses. But I guess it doesn't matter, because like a toddler, when Player support thinks something, they won't change their mind.\n\nI hold nothing against Riot as a company, I've put several thousand dollars into the game as well as thousands of hours I will never get back. I have played this game since season 2 with out ever getting even a warning for something like MMR Boosting, I am disappointed that I was not given a fair opportunity to prove my innocence but so be it. Unfortunately I see now that I am not valued as a customer to them, nor a player. Thus I will not be returning to the game and will be quitting; I do not wish to play a game made by a company who deems it okay to punish someone for something they did not do, and then not even give them the chance to prove it. It is unlawful and childish, but so be it. So I guess this is goodbye, after 7 years of playing such a wonderful game, it gets ruined by something like this.\n\nEdit: Keyru has responded on my ticket, and I have just provided my proof. Hopefully it will be enough for him to reconsider and see I am in-fact innocent. I am posting this to stay honest, and will not deface Riot's image even if I am not happy with them. Trying to give the full story:\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/afd93073ac66ab97045a52dd77e6bde8\n\nFinal update: Keyru said my proof is not enough to show I wasn't MMR boosted. I guess every MAC and IP that's played on the account is not enough. I have nothing left I can provide. I cannot upload 2TB of videos for them. I guess  I'm just going to be wrongfully punished. Sorry to say I will no longer be playing this game. \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/e335e12ea05685032784c3e897e4e3ed","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2017-12-09T22:46:52.646+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":25,"body":"Hey all,\n\nChiming in to say that our support team handling these types tickets are not robots and each player that is writing in regarding their MMR bans does have a human eye looking at them. I know it kind of sucks that we aren't sharing more information but this is done so that for those who are in the 100% (which we are confident in) can't retrace their steps and \"fix\" what they did that got them caught in the first place.\n\nMMR Boosting doesn't have to be a paid service. It can be a simple act of sharing an account with someone and them playing ranked on it. They don't have to reach a particular tier (Gold+) and it doesn't look into how you played the majority of the season. Once someone that is not you, logs into your account and plays a ranked game, this is considered MMR Boosting. This is why we strongly tell players they should not share their account information and credentials, even to those they trust.\n\nAs to OP, I've read your case. Multiple agents and myself included, have looked into your account and we're all confident this was an accurate punishment which won't be reversed.

If not, then this applies.\n\nIt really sounds like you guys have a bunch of standardized measures or a checklist for this sort of thing. Which, I'm sure works as a filter most of the time. However, isn't the point of having human eyes on this, to be able to exercise reason and commonsense with regard to those things? Otherwise it'd save you time to just have it done automatically, with automatic replies sent out for tickets.\n\nHis two ticket responses didn't seek to have a discussion or explain anything, they reiterated the punishment and didn't engage him in a meaningful way. You came here to defend the idea that you don't just have bots running this thing, but what's the point if the team that we reach out to, acts exactly like an automated process? \n\nThis guy has been up and down to Silver 1 several times, he's FINISHED THE SEASON silver 3. So he didn't even get the gold reason rewards. Why would someone who's been up to Silver 1 and down multiple times boost himself in the preseason. He's got streams with his voice/teamchat over several games and teammates who can corroborate individual games. For god's sake just match up the games you think are boosted with the games he streams and has voice chat for to determine whether your system failed at some point. If the location and mac address changes match up with the time periods in which he's moved around as well, then this seems cut and dried.\n\nKeyru, why is it difficult for the team to come up with such an obvious solution. This is why people feel like they're interacting with robots.\n","replies":[{"poster":"JeLLö","date":"2017-12-10T13:37:46.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"A lot of people seem to be fixated on preseason because that is where the OP is saying all his proof is located.  The problem is this may have ZERO to do with preseason and could have happened at any point  during season 7.  So any talk about preseason is essentially meaningless when trying to defend the OP.  This would seem to be obvious if the OP is offering recordings of preseason specifically but not the same evidence in the regular season.\n\nSecond of all, another thing most people seem to be not understanding is that mmr boosting bans can simply be a case of 1 other person other than the OP playing a ranked game on the account in question (conceptually confirmed in a RIOT post).  So again, his rank and what ranks he fluctuates between is completely irrelevant.   No payment needs to be accepted and the 1 game can be a loss.\n\nThird of all, and more direct to your post specifically, multiple humans have looked at this case and determined without a doubt that a violation occurred and \"exercised reason and commonsense\" based on DATA they hold he is guilty.  \n\nThey will never tell how or what specifically flagged it because it will put future ban waves as risk of being avoided (common sense here people)","replies":[{"poster":"Ikilleddory","date":"2017-12-12T09:06:09.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You really believe someone would boost them to silver 3 from 1, and then un boost them from silver 3 to 1 Really hell of a boost right there. -.-","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mos Deadly98","date":"2017-12-10T01:13:38.783+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":22,"body":"Youre so full of shit it hurts.

In the vast majority of cases the MAC address should not change, so this is how Riot has determined that you are \"being boosted.\" You should try to bring this up in a support ticket (hopefully reviewed by a person).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-12-09T06:05:30.283+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who elo boosts between S3 and S1?
