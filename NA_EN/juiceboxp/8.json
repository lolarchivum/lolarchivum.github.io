Doesn't stop me from ending up behind every match to my mid lane or top lane, who level way more quicker. In my opinion Jungle is the worst role in this game right now, if a enemy top laner or mid laner gets ahead its insanely punishing and they can end up 1-2 levels higher than you after your jungle clear. This makes it hard to gank because it makes a possible 2v2 impossible. I really think that jungle exp needs to be on par or just a bit behind top/mid lane. Bottom lane will always be the most behind in levels because youre trying to have your ADC farm efficiently and become a Carry late game, while having a champion that can protect him from other lane. But when I finish a Jungle clear and get to level 5 on 2nd clear, and the enemy top laner with one kill is level 7, there's not much I can do in a 2v2 situation. \nHonestly its just dumb how Jungle gets punished so hard by your own laners doing bad.

(Haven't seen him much recently, not sure if it's still the case.) It also made jungle so much less enjoyable for me. I constantly need to take breaks from the role because it's become too stressful after what, the third exp nerf?\nThere's honestly more ways to slow down junglers: Increase camp HP, slightly reduce their damage and slightly reduce the respawn time to compensate the extra time spent. Boom, junglers have less time to gank your lane but they won't be 2 levels behind on the enemy Nasus or Darius. They also won't be 3 levels behind on EVERYONE when they get killed at their buff and have 2 camps taken. :)))))))))))\n\nAnother step to getting some tanks back into the game wouldn't be buffing them a lot to ruin ADC lifes before 30 minutes but actually allowing them to be able to contest the jungle again.
