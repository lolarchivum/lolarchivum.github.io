Once you hit six, your full burst does more damage than hers because she probably won't be able to hit an E on you. Wait for her to jump on you, activating E before she does (it's fairly obvious to tell since you can farm out of her range), then use your Q to make sure the stun lands before using R+W+Ignite. She wil die or be forced to flash. You also outscale her, so once you get items you can easily 1 burst her while she will have to deal with your HP or mr, since I reccomend either rushing RoA or Abyssal Scepter. If you get behind, Banshee's Veil is wonderful, since Annie only needs 4 AP items to still do loads upon loads of damage. \n\nWith {{champion:238}}, you need to survive till you hit lvl 3. Just farm with Q. After this, you can easily trade with her by waiting for her to engage on you, then tossing your shadow (W) where she used her distortion (W). Activate your E, since she will either take the damage from being right next to you or next to your shadow, then Q to get more damage. If she is low after a trade or two, reactive W to get next to her and auto-attack, procing your passive and probably procing hers. Ignite her and she will be forced to flash or die. If you get behind, just roam to other lanes and splitpush, since you will be able to 1 burst her in due time.

QR doesn't do a ton of damage even when fed so she has to hit W or E to kill someone which are skill shots. Not to mention the whole argument about LeBlanc involves her being fed. It's not exactly hard to deal with her or avoid feeding her if you follow these simple tips.\n\n1) Respect the burst - No seriously. Don't be a jerk, don't try to play forward vs her and give her easy damage. \n2) Pick accordingly - If LB is unbanned and you don't play her, especially if you're lower elo, you can expect someone to pick her cause word on the street is she's OP. Cho'gath, Heimer, and pretty much every champ with good wave clear or tankiness very much ruins her day. My go to pick is cho since W completely ruins her day, R gets you tanky as heck, and Q+E help you shove LB to turret which forces her to level W to not miss tons of gold and lowers her overall burst. If you pick before her just play champs that don't suck at pushing or play something with long range. I have had a lot of Lux picks get LB played vs her and I just hang back and play safe and she doesn't get anywhere.\n3) Build accordingly - If you're a mage go RoA over tear or chalice, bruisery thing go abyssal, or ad go hexdrinker. It's not hard.\n4) Don't be a dick - Kinda like point one but it needs to be reiterated. Don't think you can bully her around, don't play mad aggressive and eat minion damage+q poke, and don't push endlessly and not ward. Ping missings, play safe, and force her to earn her gold the hard way, last hitting. Too many players think to win league games you need to be 15-0 by 10 minutes and play so, so needlessly aggressive that they're extremely punishable and then wonder why they're getting 'camped' or 'how lucky LB is she got away with 10%' or 'lag' or whatever the excuse of the game is.\n\nThese aren't going to make you win every game vs LB but you can't win all the time. The removal of her silence made her SOOO much more easy to fight and honestly if you think she's bad now she's not even remotely as oppressive and obnoxious as she once was. At least now you can turn around and try to cc/do your own combo while she does hers, back then you literally had to sit there and wait for LB to let you play before you could even push a button.\n\nAlso people can play w/e they want in normals. I play Yorick in normals. I play Panth in normals. Saying someone is a jerk for playing LB in normals is a really loaded statement. Maybe they're learning her for ranked or just like playing her. You don't get to dictate what is fun for other players and even if you don't like it they're entitled to their opinions. League is a game of strategy, even if you don't like playing vs someone you can use the experience to get better as well as try out new ways to deal with LB because normals don't have as much consequence. Every strategy has a counter, develop yours vs LB by playing against her more. \n\nShe's in a fine spot and is a result of a perceived power spike despite her actual power not being as high as everyone says. Lux can 100-0 you from across a lane as well as chunk an entire team in teamfights. Malz can point and click murder someone, Swain is a huge bully and gets really tanky, and Cassi is a turret of absurd dps.

What makes this infuriating is that her counterplay just isn't rewarding. If you react properly, she still isn't heavily punished as frequently as she should be.\n-----\n**Long Version**\n\nI'd vote for number three. yeah LB has counterplay but it's horribly unrewarding and is way harder to perform than it is for LB to do her combo. This results in two things: Unequal effort and unequal reward.\n-----\nUnequal effort is frustrating because LeBlanc puts in little effort to take nearly have of your health bar in one .6 sec combo, but you have to have extremely good reflexes to react. To be specific, the average human requires .2 sec to recognize a threat, let alone react. Is it possible? Absolutely. Is it harder than what LB has to do? Without question.\n-----\nUnequal reward is what makes this a problem. Can unequal effort be okay? Yes, it actually can, depending on the rewards. We saw the low risk and high reward proportions for LeBlanc's combo, but how about her counterplay? It essentially amounts to \"Okay, you're not deleted instantly, but you're low on health. Now you get to back before my low CDs are up again to finish you off.\"\n-----\nSolution number 3 is good, because it reminds me of a certain other AP mid assassin that rustles jimmies and snowballs like mad. Katarina. Annoying? Yeah. Hard to use? Nope, just hard to master. Easy to react to? Mehhh, depends on how the Kat player plays. However, one thing is certain. If you react to Katarina properly, **SHE BECOMES VERY VULNERABLE**. She probably used Shunpo to go in, and with no reset, that leaves her with very little options to escape with and you just stopped her primary source of damage.

I'm inclined to agree.\n\nHell, killing Zed is a nightmare unless you can CC him from start to finish. He pops his shadow in one direction and walks in the other, what do you do? Chase him? He teleports to his shadow and gets away. Stay at his shadow? You just let him walk away. There's two of you so you can cover both? Odds are once you're separated he can kill one of you and walk away. Three? Same, he'll just go for the loner. \n\nYou need at least four people to stop a running Zed, and that's on top of his absurd burst. Leblanc has similar issues with her clone added on top tp confuse you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grim R3aper","date":"2015-05-21T01:50:48.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"remember when she had a silence","replies":[]},{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2015-05-20T15:47:30.851+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-05-20T16:50:48.223+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"True, Galio counters LB.
