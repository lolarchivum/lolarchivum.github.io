Even in the case of Yasuo's Q, which basically just acts as another auto attack, also offers an AOE knock up.\n\nTo be clear, i never said other champions didn't create the same type of unfun gameplay due to mobility and CD abuse. Riven is one of these champions. Even if she's at a 40% win rate, she's just not fun to play against due to very similar issues as yasuo. Zed is in a similar boat, lee sin, Camille.

THEY SHOULDN'T BE, at least not in the state they are in. This is why shit like grounded debuff needs to be far more common place.\n\nThe champions which are the LEAST fun to play against, shouldn't be the champions who are given the kits which are the most fun to play. This is also party the community's fault, but also in part due to riot, that the only thing which seems to be allowed to matter in what makes a game fun or not, is WINNING. I don't care if i lose every match, if i have fun while doing it, but sadly the champions who most likely will win against me in a match are almost always the one which make the game impossible to enjoy, no matter if i'm winning or losing.
