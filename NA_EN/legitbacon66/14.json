When the limiting factor of abilities being able to 100-0 targets isn't their numbers, but rather the rate which they can be input, then what you see is that continued power creep only works to close the gap between the DPS damage, and burst damage. If DPS takes 2.5 seconds to kill a target, with almost none of that time being limited by input lag. Then a burst combo takes 1.0 seconds to kill a target, with about .5 of that time being input lag.
