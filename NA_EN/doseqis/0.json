I guess? maybe?\" it's a natural cognitive bias and it's always going to be like that, ex: auras, the support role etc.\n\n2. like you said, Dark Harvest tends to be good on champions that are underperforming, most melee-ish damage dealers, assassins and some juggernauts. the only champion in the top 30 who makes any use of this Keystone is Miss Fortune, everyone else is better off using something else.\n\nimo, you shouldn't make any more change, it has a healthy place in the ecosystem, it makes bad champions better, not great still, but better, and reduces the gap between said bad champions and the better ones, any attempt at further balancing this keystone and is going to make the game less balanced as a result.\n\nedit: do you have data for games length? say last month vs 1 year ago? and dark harvest win rate over time? it's also possible Dark Harvest power might get darwfed a bit there and the games are noticeably shorter than they used to be and Dark Harvest becomes more oppressive the longer the games last","replies":[{"poster":"Almo","date":"2018-02-26T19:41:09.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one thing you have not considered is that ARAM is all about team fighting.

The other keystones are either active every x seconds or don't scale as much. \n\n\nDark Harvest:\n\n1. Gathered with Enemy Death , Ally Death, Cannon minion \n2. Dominates team fights which is what ARAM is about (yes you can have your poke comps which can still abuse dark harvest)\n3. There is no Time limit on \"use.\" kill a champion, pick their dark harvest, attack the next and so on. \n4. Makes Tanks deal more \"significant\" damge while solely building tank items. \n5. Scales really fast. Its easy to get given how narrow ARAM is and everyone is  in the same place. \n6.   I want diversity.

It's diverting champions from picking up relevant keystones with a few exceptions like Jihn. The main issue with ARAM is its not a fair\"all random all mid.\" People have different champion pools and some even go to the extend of building ARAM accounts. This is the main issue with champion diversity that also increases the discrepancy between good and bad champions. DH is not the solution.

I believe the 'fighters' pool has the most champions of any other classes, that may explain why you see it more often than some other keystones, it's also a generalist keystone which means it should have a wider audience of champions that can pick it up, but the more specialised keystones are often better on all those champions, Aftershock may not be great on mages or adcs or assassins but it's very good on tanks, Fleet Footwork may not be great on tanks or mages or assassins, but it's very good on ADCs. etc. Having a keystone that is mediocre on a lot of champions is not an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Almo","date":"2018-02-28T05:08:20.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"don't remember the last time I played ARAM.\" Your last game was on  9/15/2017 which is more than 5 months.

I don't know how many ARAM games you have but I have about  4200 games. Riot fixed Tear, Nasus Q stacking, removed GA, and other things. When you have DARK harvest running in every game in Plat/diamond ARAM mmr then you got a  problem. It's still broken and makes the game anti fun. It kills the diversity we used to see where people pick different runes.\n\nARAM will be \"fair\" when Riot makes all champions available for this mode. This way people actually have to try to win. Having all champions sucks when playing ARAM. I only get to play Lux/EZ/Sona,etc  once every white moon that is if no one dodges. \n\n\nURF is not ARAM. URF is a rotating game mode. ARAM is one of the most active queues.
