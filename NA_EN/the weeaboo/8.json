What i do mind is that she can make it incredibly difficult to farm under tower without getting head shot constantly and you know shes gonna push. she's caitlyn. Don't even need compensation for that. Just dont let her place traps under tower. make her place them anywhere else.  Her net should not proc a head shot. there I said it. it gives her burst damage on anyone running at her which is just silly. thats supposed to be an intended weakness. Here you would need to compensate her since thats a BIG blow. I'd say give her an attack speed buff she lands her E so it rewards caitlyns who kite after landing E and not just mindlessly shooting you once for 30% of your health with one auto. \n\n\noverall though while caitlyn is toxic, she doesnt need nerfs per say outside of her traps not working under an enemy tower for very long.","replies":[{"poster":"Ormylar","date":"2017-04-25T03:00:23.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess one idea I just thought of is make traps last less time under tower, but that duration increases back up as you level it up?

The closest thing she has is her passive. Like he said, she can't use Q in fights late game because it's a decrease in dps, traps are a sieging tool and net can be a burst tool but it's also her only escape tool so you have to be cautious about using it offensively. Her R roots her and can easily be blocked, though it still deals fair damage at very long range.\nNothing in her kit says hyper carry. She's good in teamfights because she has long range and can attack targets other ADCs might need to put themselves in danger in order to attack. She's great in laning phase because of her range, allowing her to both poke while CSing as well as safely poke the enemy who's farming under tower.\n\nHypercarries are champions with stat improving abilities. Think Wuju style for master Yi, Trynd's passive, Yasuo's passive, Trist's Q, Kog's bio artillery, Jinx's Q and passive, Ezreal's passive, Twitch's Q as well as R. All these abilities and passives grant free stats or damage multipliers/enhancers. Those are the hallmarks of the hypercarries. It doesn't mean that Cait doesn't deal good damage, but she certainly doesn't output the kind of dps that these guys can come late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Muzét","date":"2017-04-26T09:06:35.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot man for your support ♪","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Luminier","date":"2017-04-25T02:19:39.830+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only issue I have is not being able to do absolutely anything against her dumb fucking traps.

Once she has IE+Hurricane, her power curve becomes quite linear. \n\nActual hypercarries outperform her pretty hard. Cait needs at least 3 AA to get a headshot, assuming you get at least 2 attacks to split to 2 additional targets through Hurricane. If she only gets to hit 1 target, she gets a headshot every 8th attack, while many other ADCs will have large attack speed increases, damage increase on every shots, % shreds or AoE attacks (or a combination of those).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2017-04-25T18:20:58.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bubbaman73,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gRI7dA91,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-24T21:00:03.197+0000)\n>\n> Reminder that most ADCs outscale her\n> \n> and https://gyazo.com/e4c7ebd9384a71b8eb40697f3e5a7989\n\nI may be wrong but I think;\n\nMF does not outscale Caitlyn.\nEzreal does not outscale Caitlyn.\nLucian does not outscale Caitlyn.\nVarus does not outscale Caitlyn \nJhin does not outscale Caitlyn (Unsure about this one)\n\n\n {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:18}}  outscale Caitlyn late game.\n\n\nNot sure about {{champion:119}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:22}} ","replies":[]}]}]}
