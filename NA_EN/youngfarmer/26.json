You seem like the sheltered type who doesn't actually understand the world or the way it works so just a bit of advice: go have fun. Weed and booze are parts of life and they are fun!

Becoming addicted and drinking and smoking/whatever in excess is different. Trying them once is actually something I would recommend, It is not in any way a bad thing to understand what they are and how they affect you. I personally have tried Marijuana on a few occasions, I found it just wasnt for me, but I am  glad I at least tried it. I say that for many reasons, one of the bigger is that I can not be pressured into it now, I have tried it and thanks to that experience have formed an educated opinion based on it.\n\nNow the try it once idea does not work for everything. There are many drugs out there that can do irreparable harm to you even after a single use. That is why it is good to know what you are getting into, do a little research on something first before doing anything extremely dangerous. Same goes for marijuana, do a little research, just make sure your sources are not propaganda and falsified. I can tell you though, trying alcohol or marijuana once will not harm you in any way... unless you do something really stupid after using them but that is on you if you went overboard. Oh yeah and it doesnt hurt to do it with a friend that is a little more experienced with it as it is much safer then.","replies":[{"poster":"MeesterMoo","date":"2015-10-07T02:06:16.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jingerbeardman,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=baAkiABl,comment-id=000000000000000400000000,timestamp=2015-10-07T01:04:57.255+0000)\n>\nunless you do something really stupid after using them but that is on you if you went overboard.\n\n\nYou just said one reason why it is stupid, most drugs affect the mind and can cause extreme brain damage and make you do stupid things WHICH is why they are dangerous.

My computer can barely keep 40 fps in a team fight on low settings. I got college debts up to my knees, and my mom with her drug history and my dad with his health problems are not only not together, but are having a general hard time in life while I just watch because I hardly have enough money to keep myself afloat. I live in a low-income neighborhood with crime and violence happening all around me and to top it all off, I'm just this unattractive guy, I'm not fat or anything I just don't look like a famous rapper or actor, no chiseled chin or 6 pack abs. The Point I'm trying to make is that drugs don't make it any easier, and every penny you spend on drugs goes to some fat druglord when it could be going to someone who deserves it: You.","replies":[{"poster":"Tac0Destroyer","date":"2015-10-07T04:57:45.016+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Great wife, job, kids, lifestyle, and hey look at that; even got a bachelor's degree.
