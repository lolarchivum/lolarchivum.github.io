As you can guess the time has to be right to fit trundle into our plans but it's clearly a contender and personally I'd love to do it.\n\nI'm curious as to what you mean by \"the time has to be right to fit Trundle into our plans.\"  Does this mean that there are some champs who are always going to be starving for skin love from Riot for arbitrary reasons, like \"We hate how this champ looks, so no new skins for years\" and \"We need more Ahri, Annie and Katarina skins because they sell?\"\n\nI mean, Yorick's already waited four years for a new skin because of some really, really weak reasons, and it's going to be another two years (minimum) before he has a chance at a new skin (rework, then getting him to \"fit into your plans\" for that third skin)...  Same with Sion (who's already waited a full year after his rework).\n\nIs it going to be worth sticking around if your team is just going to say \"Nope, no new skin for Yorick until 2019?\"\n \n> Side question, are you tired of Blood Moon at a thematic or would you like to see more?\n\nMy problem with the \"Blood Moon\" theme is that it seems to be a default when the skins team can't think of anything else for a champion.\n\nTake Zilean, for example.  The team needed to come up with a skin for that champion since his rework is several years out and he had already waited 4 years for a skin.  So, you guys just put some red particles together, slapped on Shen's mask, added a red ball to a gold coin for his back and said \"done.\"\n\nI mean, even the concept of \"Blood Moon\" barely fits Zilean, a time wizard.  As opposed to say, I dunno, Blood Moon Diana would have been a perfect fit for that champ.\n\nSome people like that skin, and I'm honestly happy for them, but I got the feeling that the team just wanted to throw out a skin for Zilean to avoid the dank memes on these boards and Reddit and didn't care to make the skin worthy of a long wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-10-07T16:33:00.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah,BM Zilean just seems random as crap.I don't even understand how he,a guy who doesn't fit the concept,was given a BM skin before other champs,that would actually make sense for them to get one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Guap","date":"2019-12-12T18:48:55.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack, realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=RhFaeoPZ,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-10-07T07:45:24.871+0000)\n>\n> I just want to say that we are very aware, and have been for at least 2 years, that Oni Trundle is a great idea!
