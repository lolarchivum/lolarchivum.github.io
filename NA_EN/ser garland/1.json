She has an AoE skillshot blind. She has her crazy birdmode execute. Her teamfight mechanics aren't great (she doesn't have Sivir's utility, Graves' tankiness, or Lucian's raw mobility to make up for her low range) but when played right, the enemy team is forced to group at all times or suffer the consequences.\n\nUnfortunately, the sound-effect for her Harrier-modified autoattack seems to play like 5 frames before the attack actually goes off, making it almost impossible to stutter-step with her. The fact that Harrier needs to MODIFY the autoattack (as opposed to being a consumable mark, for example) is bullshit too, and that's not even getting into the shitty RNG minigame it forces.

I have to say she's at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to ADC's. \n\nAs an ADC her best part of the game is early game. Her level 2 is powerful. \n\nBut that's about it. And her early game is only good IF you can play aggressively. Her poke and range is not that great. She needs to land her Q and E's. \n\nIn this lane you faced an Alistar. You using your E is asking for him to combo you. if he does it right you will be CC'ed right in front of your enemy and Bruam will have to leap to you to save you. Putting both of you in danger. \n\nYou also faced a Graves. An ADC who likes to use his abilities to kill you as much as his basic attacks. He doesn't have to care about your blind. He can also be tanky. Which is a hard thing for early aggressive champions to deal with. \n\nSo you probably didn't do well early game. You were countered, or countered yourself by picking Quinn after them. \n\nQuinn is a champion who is very reliant on her basic attacks. Her abilities base damages and scaling are not very impressive. This means she is very item dependent. She has to use her strong early game get ahead and stay ahead. if she does not do this she will be weak in the mid game. And she's always weak late game unless she's super fed. \n\n- Has to have a strong early game. This has to be done by playing aggressively. This is hard to do in a duo lane where someone else can take advantage of her weaknesses. \n- If early game does not go well she will do poorly for the rest of the game 99% of the time. ADC's cannot be dead weight. Graves is an early game ADC and will still out scale past laning phase. Only thing you have over him is a blind and mobility on your ult. \n- Her abilities as an ADC are weak. Her E puts her in harms way. Her R is a clean up/escape tool. Not something you look to your ADC for unless it's Jinx. Generally she'll face champions who kill with abilities more than AA's so her Q isn't impressive either. W is nice utility and a great steroid, but isn't reliable at all. You can't 100% control her passive and using E is risky. \n\n\n\nIt's not about Quinn being bad. It's about knowing when to use her. She is very situational and requires getting ahead to work. This is hardest to do in a duo lane. On top of her other drawbacks as an ADC. You ultimately picked a bad lane on top of being counterpicked\n\nA lot of this wouldn't be so bad if her bugs didn't exist and weren't so common. But her kit as a whole even without bugs is bad for an ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fred Fuchs","date":"2015-07-07T00:26:55.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think shes a terrible adc (coming from a plat, 5 year bot lane main) due to many reasons. Really low range, an ult made for diving and clean up, poor spacing with her e, etc... BUT i play her mid assassin all the time, and i think shes great at it. she has amazing trade potential, she counters alot of assassins mid, her burst is pretty insane, and her ability to roam is almost unmatched with her movement speed in her ult. shes also great at avoiding ganks and makes vision battles mid lane and river way easier with her w. still i think she could stand to improve.\n\nways to improve: Her power during he ult is actually a bit hindered by the fact that she cant use her passive in it as well as the fact that her passive can be really unreliable with the target it chooses. i feel if she could use her passive in her ult as well as have valor mark the last clicked enemy and increase her passives range she could be way better. Her auto range could stand to improve as well but not by to much, and maybe fiddle with her e a bit. \n\noverall i think shes a way better mid laner than she is an adc, but unfortunately people forgot about her so quickly that she isnt even being played at all. and we all know how most people are. dont want to try things that might not work so they instead wait for others to do it for them \n\ntl;rd Quinn can mid way better than adc","replies":[]}]}
