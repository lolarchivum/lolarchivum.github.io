Hitting her skills feels rewarding as they do serious damage and apply a strong CC on people. Playing her in a support position makes her a unique pick as she breaks the stereotype of supports being passive team helpers.\nHer Black Shield in particular feels amazing for avoiding CC on the enemy side and that lets the ADC just go ham and not worry about the initial CC at all. Everyone on the enemy team is either forced to burn through it and waste CC on a shield to stop the champion or ignore it and let my teammate just go uninterrupted to his intended target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Deng","date":"2016-08-15T20:34:56.710+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:43}} just cuz she literally can play every  role but adc, is super underated even though she honestly is one of the best sup/utility mid laners.
