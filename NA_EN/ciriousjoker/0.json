There was also some mention of linux users getting tripped by the anti-cheat software, and a further caution to not use it. I think the first account got banned because of just that reason, and the second account I made was just one problem after another. When I would try to submit a ticket on the second account, as soon as 'WINE' or 'Linux' was mentioned, the Riot staffers would shut down, close the ticket, and tell me extremely shortly and usually in a not very pleasant way that they would not help me, and the ticket would be closed.\n\nI was using 2-3 different versions of wine, and using PlayonLinux as the front-end configuration tool, all on top of an LTS version of Ubuntu running a Real-Time Kernel. Usually, I would have to patch it multiple times to get it to work right, and even then, sometimes there would be issues with the in-game store; which occasionally would prevent me from buying items. And after I would spend several hours getting it running okay again, it would be broken by Riot the following Tuesday.\n\nI eventually gave up on playing LoL because it just was not worth it. The tutorial was practically worthless, and did not prepare you to play in a real game at all, and once you got past about level 10 or so, the player base is such a PitA that it really isn't any fun at all. Not to mention that the 'tech help' I got was borderline moronic as they did not really seem to understand how things worked together on a computer, and if you even so much as hint that you are using linux, they absolutely shut down. I think I got one tech support ticket from someone who actually seemed to get how the software works, and was actually helpful and willing to put in a little bit of effort to try to make things work.\n\nI've been a computer pro since the late '90's, and I've watched all of the changes; I switched to Mac in the early 2000's, and after Jobs died, and I saw the impending changes coming to OSX, I basically switched over to linux and open-source entirely. The last laptop I bought had a version of windows on it, and I kept it just so I could play Skyrim, and eventually I figured I would try LoL again--but it's a handicap that I have to reboot in order to do so. I see the day coming where I just won't play any game unless it will work fairly well on Linux, who actually has a growing gaming community because of the work NVidia and Steam have put in. \n\nI hope riot notices, and eventually makes a linux-native client--even if it only works on one particular desktop or distro.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NA Omega","date":"2018-06-11T22:44:18.213+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The safest thing you can do.. it to NOT run lol through Wine.

I've been Linux-only for years and currently I'm using Lutris' DX9-based install; it was almost completely hands-off (only some dialogue box clickthrough during installation) and it kinda-works.

I think thats why they banned me as well.\n you can look at my ticket as mysticrodent, and I know it wasn't the guy that took my tickets fault, but the first guy i was rude too because i was so pissed off when it first happened, because i had spent a lot of time building my account, i had lvl 4 honor, most of that champs, about 7 of the 20 run pages, several skins that where legendary and epic quality and it was all taken away because, riot decided that my account needed banning because i am running linux.\n Its hard enough to get the client to run in wine in the first place and damn near and impossibility to run scripts with of which I have no desire to run script just for the fact they are unsafe.\n What pisses me off the most was they lied right to my face saying i was heavily scripting when i knew for a fact there was no scripts period running at all and made feel like i was being called a liar on top of it, when i called them out on it their response was we dont lie to our customers because its bad for business, well the reality they can ban you for using linux/wine because its in their tos as running 3rd party whether you cheat or not then lie about you having some sort of advantage over other players, like what they cant rdp in my machine and look through my crap then sell it to 3rd party.\n I ask if i have to run mac or windows thier response was yeah run windows 10 and  youll be ok.\n Honestly i would rather be ran over by a train burned at the stake, hung from a bring and be picked clean by vultures.

To be able to if you wish download, modify (fix bugs), create and share software with your friends, family, ect.\n What gets me the most is both apple , google and microsoft have bastardized the very core of what gnu/linux is supposed to be,\nApple's core is freebsd as far as i can tell or seen they have not contributed anything to the bsd community, and they where sure as hell ready to close source any work they did on the mac\nGoogle 90% of mobile devices run a form of linux on them, and yet the only made cef availible for windows. Lets also mention that your mobile device spies on everything you do, where you are where you go, what you buy, what you search the INTERNET for so that they can customize ads to get you to impulse buy something.\nAnd finally microsoft the worst company ever created for violating the rights of its users, and if you think its bad now, in about 5 years or less, you wont be able to do anything in you home without microsoft knowing about it, and when it comes to your appliances in your homes, you will have to maintain them at your expense whether you want it or not.\nSo it may not matter if i get banned again, im probably going learn how to play dota2 since they are supportive of the linux community. \n Im also going to drop wow as well, i think.

If a player is caught out by just a little bit, and dies, then that sets off the whole chain reaction--it happens a little bit easier next time, but it takes another death or three before you can really learn that it's over and/or accept it. There's no way to learn in an environment like that.\n\nIf Riot wants shorter games, then encourage people to play shorter game modes, like 3v# or ARAM or URF. If Riot wants to see more spectacular plays, well; I hate to break it to you, but spectacular plays are by natural law, rare--that's what makes them spectacular.
