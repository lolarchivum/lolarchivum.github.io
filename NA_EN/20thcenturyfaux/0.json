Zyra the plant mage! \n\nThe biggest thing Zyra players have asked for is more play around plants, and we completely agree. Her enemies feel the plant theme strongly, especially when they&rsquo;re limping away from her burst combo under a hail of thorns. Zyra herself currently experiences plants as a way to invest more in a spellcast through W; we&rsquo;d like to take this further. Her broader role as a counter-initiating zone controller is awesome so we&rsquo;ll be looking to heighten it where we can. \n\nThe next thing on the wishlist is the passive. Player discussion as well as our own internal investigations have shown it&rsquo;s the weakest part of her kit, and we think we can do better for her passive. Rise of the Thorns provides some cool moments at a time when nothing else is going on since you&rsquo;re dead, so we expect players will notice the absence at first, but we feel this ability holds Zyra back more than it helps her. The spell&rsquo;s slow missile speed and long windup were required for it to be fair, but in the course of becoming fair it lost a lot of fun. \n\nOn the upside, Zyra has a bouquet of good stuff. Her E is cool, satisfying, and very planty. Her squishy, defensive zone controller thing fits &ldquo;plant mage&rdquo; really well. ~~We&rsquo;re balancing her for the support role, but we do want to ensure that midlane stays fertile ground~~ (update on this below). Lastly, the gameplay of spawning seeds during spellcast may not be the flashiest thing around, but it *is* uniquely Zyra and provides some subtle play -- do I put my seed on their feet or where I think they&rsquo;re going to go? Do I get two ranged plants, two melee, or one of each? They&rsquo;re unique and they deserve to be preserved. \n\nHere&rsquo;s where we think she&rsquo;s at:\n\nStuff that&rsquo;s good\n\n* Strong identity as a counter-initiate mage. \n* Preserve her ability to catch and burst people who enter her domain.\n* You feel the plant theme strongly playing against her. \n* She dies quick if you catch her. \n* Her ult is powerful, distinctive, and satisfying. \n\nStuff that&rsquo;s less good\n\n* She doesn&rsquo;t have enough ways to play around plants. \n* Her passive isn&rsquo;t as fun as a passive should be.  \n* Plant behavior often feels inconsistent / buggy \n\nHere&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to get out of the Zyra changes\n\n* Zyra&rsquo;s playstyle has more opportunities to play around plants.\n* Players who attack an entrenched Zyra should be very afraid. \n* Zyra&rsquo;s strategic nature as a counter-initiator is even stronger. \n \nThat&rsquo;s all the thoughts for the initial post. I&rsquo;m happy to answer questions and join in the discussion, I&rsquo;ll be following the thread as it develops! \n\nGood hunting,\n20thCenturyFaux","replies":[{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2016-03-18T02:44:56.276+0000","up_votes":338,"down_votes":50,"body":"Can you please explain why the hell you're primarily 'balancing her for support'?

What's more, given her strengths -- zone control, CC, damage etc -- most anything we give her will be good in both lanes.

We’ve done some research and had a fair number of internal discussions on the topic, and we wanted to post about changes in our thinking. The #1 clearest thing that’s come from the conversation is that there’s a lot of passion about where Zyra wants to go and everyone wants the freedom to make their own way on the rift, without feeling like someone's telling them what lane they should be in. To that end, we think it isn’t smart to aim balance toward a specific lane. We feel we should update Zyra as a whole, not any given role for her.  \n\nWe want to improve the experience of playing Zyra without mind toward lane. When we update a champion, we try to preserve what’s cool and unique about a character—a lot of what makes Zyra cool and unique has found success in bottom lane and we don’t want to remove it. That’s always been our aim; extending that to balance philosophy is a bridge too far. In the end, that’s what these direction threads are meant for—to catch stuff like this and fix it. \n\nWe’ve seen the poll and are doing our own surveys and studies etc, and the main lesson from them is that both roles have lots of players. Our goals for the update are to make Zyra feel more like a plant mage, enhance her strategic role as a counter-initiate mage, and help make her more fun. There’s nothing in there about lane, and it’s not our intent to tell either group where they should or shouldn’t play. Going forward, we’re putting her in more midlane tests and making sure we don’t leave a lane behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lesbian Zyra","date":"2016-03-22T21:40:45.315+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Katai Jyji,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=xVQr7ihf,comment-id=002e000300000001000b,timestamp=2016-03-19T10:45:33.698+0000)\n>\n> Personally, I wouldn't  use the word \"tolerate\" because it kinda seems negative, and some players just like to play her here.

As someone who has mained Zyra Mid since Season 2 (with 2000+ Zyra Mid matches), I'm very disappointed with this decision.\n\nZyra has always been a Mid-Lane Mage first, and Support second. Most Zyra players I know enjoy her more in the mid-role, but are only forced to play her support (over the last 2 seasons) because you nerfed Zyra to be a less-than-optimal pick in the Mid-Lane.\n\n**The Majority do not PREFER her as a Support, but have simply DEALT WITH IT and RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTED IT because it's currently the only role where she's more than mediocre at.**\n\n~~~\n\nLook at her Most Frequent Build on Champion.gg: {{item:2049}} {{item:3092}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3135}}  Apart from Sightstone and the Gold-Gen item (which are mandatory on all Champions playing Supp), where do you see the Support items in her build??? Where??? Since when does a Support build full Magic Pen (especially Void Staff) unless they intend to do nothing more than deal tons of damage and delete enemies on their own, without having to rely on the ADC?\n\nIn your supposed \"Recommended Items\" page for Zyra, you're telling us that we should buy: {{item:3117}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3060}} {{item:3050}} but when have you ever seen a Mid/High-Elo Zyra player frequently buying these actual Supportive items???\n\nI will tell you now, not a single Zyra Main picks Support with the intention to actually aid/support their ADC. We play her as \"Bot-Lane AP Carry\" and nothing else. We just pretend that we're \"supports\", but we're actually there to build full AP + Magic Pen, and be the AP Carry for the team.\n\n~~~~\n\nI was really hoping that you'd finally bring her back to the Mid-Lane with this update (as some Rioters previously stated so), but now I'm just crushed.\n\nWhy even balance her around Supports? Apart from her AoE crowd-control, she doesn't even have any of the utility that a true support has (shields, heals, ally buffing, enemy debuffing, auras, tankiness, mobility to roam, etc?). Heck, even Morgana and Lux have more \"support utility\" than Zyra does (with their ally-casting shields; one which blocks enemy crowd-control), yet everyone knows that Morgana and Lux are Mid-Lane Mages first, and Supports second.\n\nWhy balance Zyra around Supports when her combo can deal more AoE burst than most of the current Mages in the meta?\n\nWhy balance her around Supports when most ADCs don't even appreciate a good Zyra player because they'd rather a \"real Support\" that can heal/shield/buff them?\n\nWhy balance her around Supports when her entire kit pretty much screams \"AP Carry!\"?\n\nSeriously Riot...","replies":[{"poster":"Danskheart","date":"2016-03-18T15:41:56.295+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":3,"body":"> I will tell you now, not a single Zyra Main picks Support with the intention to actually aid/support their ADC.

It literally defeats the purpose.\n\nI 100% agree here - Make Zyra firmly a mid-laner; I'm tired of seeing her as a \"support\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Casri","date":"2016-03-18T01:48:45.392+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":5,"body":"I like the sound of everything except **this**:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=20thCenturyFaux,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=xVQr7ihf,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-18T01:01:18.351+0000)\n We&rsquo;re balancing her for the support role,\n\nAs a Zyra main (with a high preference for mid lane) this worries me.

Her mid and support share the same strengths- this is well known, but in a duo lane her inherent weaknesses (2nd most squishy and most immobile champion) are less pronounced as she is **not** the focus target, her ADC is.\n\nSo when you say you're balancing her as a Support, in my view, it provides an excuse to keep her solo lane weaker than it ought to be, at the potential threat of her becoming too strong a support.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2016-03-18T03:32:11.929+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":65,"body":"She gets played both lanes successfully and will continue to--we're committed to keeping her strong in both lanes.

The lane isnt even 'new' it was her originally intended lane. Furthermore 'balancing her for mid' isnt forcing her out of supporting. If you're suggesting it is then how isnt 'balancing her for support' forcing her out of mid lane?\n\nAlso the argument that 'most people play her bot therefore she should be balanced as a support' is flawed. She got nerfed out of mid lane. People who play Zyra didnt just randomly all decided they wanted to play her as support, its simply the only lane in which she is viable.\n\nA couple seasons ago people used to play Kha'zix mid until he got nerfed, now hes only played jungle. Similar to Zyra, Kha'zix players didnt magically decide mid wasnt fun and jungle was the place to play him. People want to win, if you cant win with Kha'zix mid guess what? You're probably not gonna be playing him there. If you really like playing Zyra and want to win, you're probably gonna play her in the place you actually have a chance of doing so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2016-03-18T02:04:01.539+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":6,"body":"Zyra support means taking kills from ADC and CS\n\nShe is only good bot lane IF you play her as a Mid laner and you are the Carry","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Katai Jyji","date":"2016-03-18T01:34:27.583+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":9,"body":"That's honestly kinda disappointing to wait 14 days in comparison to the 7 days for other champions and have such a lackluster resume of her imo, especially when you're aiming to balance her for support when you announced ( well not you but another rioter ) in another thread that  she expressed best herself when she was in a primary role for gold. A good mid will always find its way to the botlane, a good support won't find its way to the midlane.\n\nFurthermore, in the other directions every spell of them were treated differently, strenghts, weaknesses and what it implied for the gameplay of the champion and what they intended to do for each one of their spells.\n\nHere you're merely saying \"that's cool, that's satisfying, that's good\", just why is it good ? Why is it cool ? Why is it satisfying ? \n\nWhat do you intend to do with the passive ? Tweak the current one or add a complete new one ? In which direction will it go ? \n\n>You feel the plant theme strongly playing against her.\n\nIn what way is the Q representing the \"plant theme\" for you ? Except for the \"plant skin\" ? That's merely Brand's W, with less range, less damages, but a shorter CD. The plant theme is provided by the W effect, not the Q.\n\n> Zyra herself currently experiences plants as a way to invest more in a spellcast through W; we’d like to take this further.\n\nCool, how do you intend to do that ? Adding more interaction with her spells ? her passive ? \n\n>Do I get two ranged plants, two melee, or one of each? They’re unique and they deserve to be preserved.\n\nThe problem is plante balance atm and again, the AI behind both. One ATM is clearly stronger (range plants) due to the buggy AI, the fact that slows don't stack, and a strong synergy with some items ( Rylai.. ). Will we have a \"fix\" of the AI and the bugs we can often encounter ? ( Not attacking when in range, not attacking for 0.5sec after blooming, wrong target .. )\n\n>  Her E is cool, satisfying, and very planty\n\nHer E is cool, very planty and iconic of the character, sure, but it's everything but satisfying atm. That's one of the slowest CC of the game, so easily avoidable by anyone with dashes or high mobility, especially with all these new items and buffs,  that is requiring an immobile champion to stand still ( her crouching animation taking at least 0.5 sec) for 30% to 70% of its duration depending on your levels. \n\nSyndra can stun in multiple directions for twice the speed while not having a casting time, sure both are really different, and Zyra's overwhelming teamfighting strenght should come with a downside like her poor resistances and her fragile state, but in the other hand she doesn't have anything that allow her to survive or outplay the enemy depending of the player's skill given she's the slowest champion of the game, her E isn't complex enough to provide her a good protection and her ultimate has a pretty long windup thus isn't reliable enough ( knowing you don't seem interested in giving the choice to players for example to closing the trap early thus affecting the CCed zone) . \n\nDo you intend to do something about her survivability despite keeping her fragile state ( resistances, HP ..) or is that a no go?  That's one of the main reasons she's more frustrating to play every season due to all these mobility changes and new champions with pretty safe kits, I kinda have the feeling that by \"balancing her for support\" you're just entirely skipping the reasons why she isn't played much in other roles, that's because she's too dependant of others.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2016-03-18T02:02:17.402+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'll answer your questions as best I can!

As other folks have pointed out here, there's not much room on the spell--Zyra has enough to think about, so the Q has to stay simple; the simpler it is, the less room it has. We're exploring what we can do with it, mainly around giving Zyra more ability to make plants with it. \n\n> Cool, how do you intend to do that ? Adding more interaction with her spells ? her passive ?\n\nAll these are options, and we've tried most of them!
