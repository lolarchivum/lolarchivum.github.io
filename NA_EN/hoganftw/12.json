Bot lane only has room for up to 4 top tiers at once, so that's about it for me. She could be strong right now and I just don't know, since Kog has apparently been bopped off. Up till now, though, she's been \"aight\" in my mind. Not bad at all, but not some big shit popping in bot lane.\n \n> Sivir is not varus/xayah/tristana, but she can still work which means she is strong, because the opposite of strong is weak\n\nSo I think we're on the same page. I guess my wording was strong. I didn't mean to imply she was *weak,* either.\n\n> no adc is weak right now except lucian (even after buffs) jhin (even after buffs) ashe and kog (who should not be buffed but reworked)\n\nAND QUINN!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiG JJ","date":"2018-02-09T21:49:51.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't call someone with one of the shortest AA ranges \"good\" or even necessarily \"good\" design.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-02-09T21:53:22.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"thanks god she has 500 range\nthe adc that has i don't know how much movement speed with ult, passive, and phantom dancer PLUS has a spellshield\n\nsivir is literally kalista but with a spellshield, and instead of saving a single dude she can save an entire team","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-02-10T18:43:58.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's ... not right, as someone who used to play Sivir she isn't even close to Kalista lol. \nAnd trying to compare a second life to your supp  (+engage if the supp wants) to Sivir ulti is straight up stupid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-02-10T21:18:38.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"but she can still work which means she is strong, because the opposite of strong is weak\"\n\nWhat the fuck?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2018-02-09T20:40:30.147+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"What?
