It's that ADCs are the only ones tanks aren't supposed to counter (except by surviving a bit longer and being able to apply CC to give an assassin an opening in a teamfight; NOT by killing them alone, because only an assassin or burst mage should do that). And then Thornmail comes into the picture, and suddenly the only one who could beat them alone now kills themselves trying. Thornmail is overtuned. It deserves the nerf.\n\n\nmaybe in bronze. sorry, but you have no idea how it looks in higher elo, where adc has insane peel and it's very unlikely for him to die, and where full tanks explode in less than 2 seconds. the amount of both ad and ap damage combined with crazy amounts of penetration make tanks squishy honestly, and thornmail doesn't change anything right now, especially with the fact that adc is most the time the only champ in a team that uses aa to deal damage. so yeah, thornmail (armor items overall) is pretty much useless at late game right now, and it will get even worse after 5.16","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Horrow","date":"2015-08-17T00:01:10.631+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoMNia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Kt07wA02,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-16T18:37:20.571+0000)\n>\n> What?

Broken Wings and Wind Slash do not apply lifesteal.\n\nTo be honest, I would like to understand how Thornmail is supposed to counter lifesteal. It can counter if the enemy only has lifesteal. However, once they have crits, penetration, and some magic resistance (either an item that provides magic resistance such as QSS or Banshee, or an ally with Locket of the Iron Solari) then Thornmail becomes worthless against lifesteal. Also, I have seen some ADCs, especially Vayne, that forgo an Infinity Edge and instead use a Bloodthisther + Blade of the Ruined King, this makes them have ridiculous amounts of lifesteal, allowing them to heal more than Thornmail can reflect back. \n\nThornmail only counters lifesteal early when carries do not have those things. As the game passes, Thornmail tends to fall off, and late game, Thornmail isn't of much help even against ADCs. I personally think that Thornmail could reflect all physical damage to allow it to scale during the game.\n\nIt is also important to remember that rushing Thornmail is very risky as this item is completely useless against AP casters.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-08-16T23:30:18.108+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The math doesn't support that. Crits increase pre-mitigation damage, which increases damage reflection. As for MR, ADCs have a flat 30 base MR. Add Maw of Malmortius for +40, and the current 30% damage reflection is reduced to about 17.5%. Bloodthirster heals 20% of post-mitigation damage. BY ITSELF, Thornmail causes Bloodthirster to heal less than half of the reflected damage at any amount of AD. Add Last Whisper, and a total of 350 armor will still result in the attacker healing a little over 1/3 of the damage they receive (actual lost health, not pre-mitigation damage), which might be brought up to half if they have BT+BoRK. Thornmail basically always outpaces lifesteal by a significant margin.\n\nThere's a REASON armor is getting nerfed, and Thornmail in particular. I know a 400 armor tank gets demolished by magic damage, but a tank is not ever supposed to be immune to an ADC. That's not how it's supposed to work. Sustained DPS is the nominal counter to tanks. An ADC should not need an APC's help and have to 2v1 a tank, just because of Thornmail. And that's only if the tank goes full armor and doesn't fight back. A balanced build that allows them to survive the AP assassin to an extent still leaves the ADC up a creek.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-08-16T23:44:22.000+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"One thing.\nBork actually can heal over Thornmail, it's passive on-hit doesn't proc Thornmail.

Combine that with the fact that magic resistance largely reduces the amount of lifesteal needed to outpace Thronmail's damage (unless the tank has magic penetration, which is extremely unlikely to happen) and Thornmail basically becomes worthless by late game.\n\nADCs build mostly glass cannon, but the three defensive items that most ADCs build late game to finish build ({{item:3102}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3026}}) come with magic resistance, which reduces the damage done by Thornmail. {{item:3190}} (when built by an ally) further reduces this damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UPfreely","date":"2015-08-16T20:24:48.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"does hydra proc thornmail? if not that'd be a reasonable change.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-08-16T17:50:22.541+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{champion:238}} ults the tank and soon sees the shuriken over his own head as he jukes himself to \"safety\" \n\n\nyes please","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-16T20:39:27.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"Lmao crying about Zed.
