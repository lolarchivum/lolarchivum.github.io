The note about Harrowing being separated from Halloween only means the Harrowing Mist (Shadow Isles Lore) won't be the theme of every Halloween event from now on. This year we are having a **Zombie Apocalypse themed event.**\n\nQuote from KateyKhaos, answering someone on PBE:\n\n>When you consider it's a Harrowing skin... ehh. I would have much preferred to see something like the Zombie Jinx concept that was floating around. It seems like wasted potential to me.\n\n RIOT KateyKhaos: _\"It's not exactly a Harrowing skin, which is why it's not Shadow Isles-related or something we've seen in the past. This may make more sense **when the event rolls out**. I'd love to know what you think once the **event** is over!\"_ - 12 days ago\n\nalso:\n\nRIOT KateyKhaos: _\"We've got a lot of awesome stuff planned. Since it's going to be a bit different than other years, I'd love to hear your thoughts after the event ends!\"_\n\n\nThe only \"mistake\" (not really a mistake) by Riot's part was not releasing it on October 31, the official Halloween day. But the event will happen.\n\ntl;dr: ** Halloween will happen. I just thought I should make this thread because I've seen so many people bummed that they had been saving RP for the previous years' legacy Halloween skins and they thought they wouldn't come back from the vault this year. I'm no Rioter to give you 100% of certainty, but Legacy skins have that name for a reason: they always return seasonly, and this year there will be a Halloween event, when they should open the Halloween vault. So don't go on a shopping spree yet! Your anticipated skin might come soon!** \n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\nsource from the quote: http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/0WNQU63l-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-slayer-jinx?show=rundown\n\nI believe it has been stated by other Riot staffs that there will definitely be a Zombie event for this Halloween, but I couldn't find it.

I like lore, but if I wanted ONLY something to read, I'd go pick up a book. Last time I checked LoL was a video game.

Heck, Demon Vi and Spirit Fire Brand seem more \"Harrowing\" esque than what you went with. It was weird and not well thought out. \n- **Give us a map skin**. Why is it that you had the time to put out map skins when league was a start up game, but suddenly you have no time now? they even had interesting and intractable elements, such as the ghost urf, spooky bushes, or the \"coffin-ized\" champions.  It's like you just don't care about your own events. It's so important you actually set an atmosphere. You still have time to make a winter map for that season. Start now, if you haven't. \n-**Minion skins**. They were fucking adorable and easy to make.

Same with Definitely Not Blitzcrank. Not every skin that comes out for these events needs to be super expensive or high end. This is a case where quantity is important, because some champions will NEVER get a Harrowing/scary skin, with only ~2 coming out a year. \n- **Add an event page that interacts with the game.** Kind of like the Shurina or Freljord event. I particularly like when you give players a choice and make them feel like they're accomplishing something. The Sejuani vs Ashe vs Lissandra thing is a good example of this, and we still have the icons to demonstrate which side we chose. \n- **Make a video**. I know this one is a huge request, but you literally only need to make one or two of these a YEAR, and they don't have to be long. When you login to something scary as fuck, you know you're in for a good Halloween. Maybe you could even make the client scary too? Have some spiders and cobwebs on the login screen. Let's see that festivity right when you login (: \n- **LORE**. This is something you actually did pretty well on this year. However, without anything else surrounding it, it feels too isolated. For this reason, many people won't even bother reading it. \n\nThese are just a few of my suggestions. I'm sure others have more, but I hope you can realize why some of us are disappointed. I hope next Harrowing will be a lot better.","replies":[{"poster":"Kat  Head","date":"2015-11-04T05:31:43.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sophitia,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=rrtYgxix,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-11-04T05:18:42.353+0000)\n>\n> Let's be honest, that's boring as fuck, and every year it seems like you actually lower the standard. \n> I'm not even looking forward to your next \"event\" at this point. \n> Compare the Harrowing now to league's first harrowing, and you'll see why your users are so annoyed / upset. \n> \n> You know what we want, and you just decided you don't want to do it.

They just do not seem to care anymore. While there are quite a few great individual Rioters the company itself is devoid of soul, it has lost its human touch and its ability to know what its customers desire. It has lost its desire to actually do what it knows the customer wants done.\n\nTime and time again Riot proves they do not care about there customers with the actions they take. Many times they even take this a step further and antagonize there very own customer base, many times mocking them with the changes they make. This game is on its death bed, it is only still populated because nothing solid has yet risen to take its place. It will happen, maybe this year maybe next year but Riot unless immediate and massive changes take place is dead as a gaming company. What a shame that is, such a great start this company had with a great game to boot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Níx","date":"2015-11-03T22:20:17.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Snowdown not for Christmas\n\nHarrowing not for Halloween\n\nLunar event IS for Chinese New Year.
