For starters the % may not be right, - 50% is such a larger difference that characters with strong healing end up being really feast or famine depending on whether they're facing GW or not. Shifting to a lower %, and reducing healing/regen amounts somewhat, might be more appropriate.\n\nAs far as GW on individual champions goes we've stripped it off a number of champions because of the amount if felt like some match ups were decided in champion select.

Stacked up to 10 times to a full reduction. A bit of a difference though as that game's resource system was a lot difference(4 elements, you'd use one ability to charge the element,then another to consume). Wasn't horrible, had it's down sides though. \n\nBack on point on this though. What if healing in league reduced further healing by 5%, stacking up to 5 times. Then make GW double this debuff. Keeping the full 50% as a possibility but situatonal. \n\nProblem comes from special effects like Janna's R, Swain's R, Vlad's everything. Champions who's kit is based on or have a lot of repeated healing. \n\n------\n\nAnother one, which I personally really like, is a \"gray health\" mechanic. Works just like Tahm. Taking damage leaves a bar of the missing HP. \n\nAfter this reduce all base healing by whatever the balance teams says to. Then give all heals the ability to heal \"x\" more of this gray health.\n\nI really like this because it makes healing a little more reactionary instead of passive like it currently is. Sooner you heal, the more your heal is worth. If you just sit in the back, it's going to cost you more mana(or HP for Soraka). \n\nA lot can be done with this. You can make a champion like Soraka who already costs her own HP to heal, have a better base heal but less gray heal. Nami's heal could be the same for all bounces, but the %ap change could factor off gray healing. \n\nCan go further with items. SV could increase the gray health left or reduce the decay. Warmog's could grant it's passive to gray health even if in combat(probably need nerfed though). Spell vamp could be buffed but have a larger focus on gray health. \n\nGW could increase the decay/reduce the gray health left. \n\n---\n\nLast one is a ward. It'll share a slot with pink wards. Have 3 HP. Does not stealth. But applies GW around it in a large area. A lot of down sides could come of this \"anti-healing in a pocket\". But I could see Riot rolling with it and making something interesting. Or just items with actives in general. Like FQC. Which is considered the weakest support item.
