Except for the characters themselves (who are very well illustrated, well done there), the splash is extremely boring. There&#039;s nothing happening other than them posing. The background is a pattern over a purple gradient and nothing else, which is really lackluster after the amazing Arcade MF and Final Boss Veigar splash arts. \n**Edit:** I'd like to expand on the MF and Veigar example. Their splash arts actually have something happening in them. Veigar is descending upon the land on a tetris piece to destroy and conquer. Miss Fortune sits in a glorious arcade throne with Gangplank in the background glaring angrily at her. In comparison, this splash for Riven/Blitzcrank has them illustrated independently and thrown onto a seemingly unrelated background. _Nothing is happening_\n\nThe worst part of the splash is that it&#039;s _one splash_ for _two 1350 RP skins._ You have two 1350 skins here, the least you could do is give them their own cool splash arts. This is becoming an alarmingly common occurrence among your recent skins. I get it with the cheaper 750 skins where they&#039;re nothing THAT fancy, but you have two much more expensive skins here. People pay the extra money for skins like this because of all the effort gone into them and how nice they look because of the effort. The splash art seems like a small part of a skin, but it&#039;s still a lot to cheap out on, especially when you&#039;re paying $15 for it.\n\n**TL;DR**: The splash for the two new arcade skins is really disappointing especially considering it&#039;s \"the splash\" and not \"the splash_es_\"\n\nNot to mention Blitzcrank's claw is on the wrong side in his own version of the splash (pictured above)\n\n**Edit:** A couple people pointed out that it looks like a fighting game loading screen, sans the \"VS.\" It really needs a \"VS\" if that's the case to make it a bit more exciting. The shared splash is still a really lame trend though and I'd still like to see separate splash arts for these skins as they don't really fit together other than being thematic enemies (which should be reflected in the splash if they _must_ be together. They could be doing battle or something rather than simply posing à la fighting game loading screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-08-06T00:56:14.256+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly?

I don't know what the final plan is for it or why it's not on there yet, but I actually did a little bit of work on it so I know it exists. Often yes, it's lower scope skins that have combined splashes (although I do like that they allow us to show a group of skins in context), but occasionally an idea like this comes up that we think is genuinely cool. The other thing that happens is that while the splash is being worked on we go all out on a skin that was planned for a low scope and push it up because we have a great idea.
