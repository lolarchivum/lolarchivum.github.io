Just because you cannot see the wonder that dwells within something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  It is easy to love something _because_, because it is beautiful, or wonderful, or awe inspiring.  True love is in the despite.  Loving something despite it's flaws.  Being willing to put aside differences, to look past the ugly side and see the gem inside.\n\nThat is something we too often forget.  It is the lesson I learned from Taric, because playing him has truly shaped me over the years.  I used to be dark and cynical, and a part of the still dwells within me.  However due to Taric I can now look on all things and attempt to look past their flaws to find the beauty within.  It is the reason I haven't given up on this community or the people in it, and if I can look past the shadows at the heart of League players to try and help them and appreciate the beauty within then who is to question my mentor's ability to see beauty at the heart of Ezreal?","replies":[{"poster":"New Tool Album","date":"2017-03-08T19:33:15.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i fucking died \"to look past the ugly side and see the gem inside\" and your name","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-03-08T21:31:53.269+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=reaperteaser,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=k30z7yUW,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2017-03-08T05:42:32.844+0000)\n>\n> i dont get what taric sees in him, he deserves better\n\nIt's not what Taric *sees* in him.
