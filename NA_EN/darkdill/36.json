On the other hand, Zed has above-average sustain for an assassin that has manaless poke and good last-hit capability, so I&#039;d have thought that nerfing his health regeneration to a level similar to Katarina would be a good type of nerf.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it would seem you don&#039;t think that way.

That's a principle driven change, rather than a power driven one, so changing base stats doesn't address the same issue. \n\nIf, as a separate problem, Zed's shrugging off damage too quickly in lane we certainly could nerf his health regen. There is the risk with that approach on a character that builds lifesteal early of creating a more snowbally pattern of success/failure however, something assassins are already prone to. Would want to dig into what the laning problem was, when in the lane it occurred, against who etc before picking a specific solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2015-05-15T02:05:33.217+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"but what about the unlimited return range on his ult... a 1 second window is great but that unrestricted return range is still ridiculously powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"YossarianSensei","date":"2015-05-15T02:07:58.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I agree, Zed is too mobile.

Currently zeds ult is even worst than it was before in team fights. The one second delay at lvl 6 to about 13 is fair but as the game progresses it's not about 1v1 situations where the opponent can react. Zeds ult is pretty much a gap closer, evasive spell in team fights and most of the time does zero dmge. Zed has the most delayed burst out of the assassins if not has zero burst if they know what they're doing. Idk how you guys can say zeds burst rotation is .25-.5 seconds when it clearly says the mark detonates in three seconds during which so many things can be done to stop it. If you're talking bout wqe combo, well if the enemy adc is within that range, that's their poor positioning. \n\nHonestly a fed kat/leblanc or talon is way more scary than a fed zed. You know it's over when their Katharina gets fed and just face rolls a penta kill. Zed gets fed? Cool lets play it out and when he ults just exhaust/cc/qss/zhonya and force him to just r back instantly doing no dmge(which he can't even do anymore).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mephistophilis","date":"2015-05-15T10:00:39.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reduce his waveclear!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-05-15T02:29:02.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you considered looking at AD caster itemization in general? It is *way* too lenient. Way too many things build out of longswords or other first cheap components. I always find that if I'm in lane against Zed and I bully him out he'll always be able to get something when he comes back. Meanwhile I have to farm to large breakpoints while being forced to rush a defensive item.\n\nThat's just one of many things that he has going for him. He might not be incredibly strong at one thing, but he's got so many smaller things going for him that he shouldn't be able to do.

Zed ult is already countered by so many things in this game like qss, zhonya's, among others, which means there's a ways in the game to counter is ult. \nMaking zed survivability worse is not a good ideia since you are a squishy target made to assasinate and with a high skill cap already. What you could have done is making is w cd higher at early ranks instead of chaniging more things in is ult. \nThis is my opinion on the change to zed ult and I believe it hurts zed realy badly. He is supposed to be high skill high reward champ so there are somethings I think that can't be messed up.\n\nPS: The ideia on the delay time before you could back to your initial abaility location would be a great nerf to lb. That's the champ I feel if she couldn't return to is W before waiting one 1 sec would make her less banned and hurt a bit on is ludicrous mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"lB2kGRlc8y","date":"2015-05-18T08:20:08.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, expensive items were a counter to Zed's ult, like banshees and mercs were counters for Veigar's stun, but they nerfed the hell out of that, so it makes sense that they would share the love.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-05-18T06:10:16.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, you say there should be \"a brief period in which to respond\"... but we're letting LeBlanc just nuke people and jump away to a safe distance?

Why is zed so tanky out of the box with no items even though he builds a mix of damage and lifesteal to keep him safe while also dealing damage? His ult has never been his problem (imo) because so many things in the game counter it so nerfs to that don't really change my frustrations when playing against him.

Now is almost impossible. \n\nYou know that 1 second is a LOT of time talking about the gameplay of an assasin. \n\nAnother point, you made Zed's Death Mark to create the shadow in the original position as a safe point, a less abussive ultimate, but now you are taking away a part of that factor or \"ability\" you gave him.  \n\nI'm not here to convince you to change what you have done, mostly because sadly, I'm not a designer, but I've played Zed so so so many times that I 've lost the count.\nThe moment I play against someone who knows how really Zed works is when I feel the nerf so hard thus is not a good experience for me to know that if I try to kill someone bursty like me I will also die, in a normal situation I won´t kill my target in 1 second even throwing my whole combo in 0.5 seconds, I'll have to wait for the mark to pop in order to assassinate, if that target is not a burster it will be a ccer and we have the same uncomfortable situation where I cannot even rely too much on the W because it has a lower range than the ultimate and it is slow and doesn´t make you untargetable...\n\nIn this case, shouldn´t the W has less cooldown, or make something like \"While Living shadow from Death Mark is active the cd reduction of W from enemies struck by Shadow Slash is increase by 3 seconds instead of 2\" or \" After dashing through his target Zed gains 30/40/50% movement speed by the duration of the mark (3 seconds)\"\n\nRegards and peace.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-05-15T02:08:06.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I often feel when I try to poke at Zed as Lux, he just shrugs it off once he's got a Bilgewater Cutlass unless you try to proc her passive on him (which is suicide). However, that could just be a Lux problem; her E's damage is pretty weaksauce for what it costs.\n\nBut think of it this way - Zed's got many of the same strengths as Katarina in lane: good manaless poke with his Q, mobility, and a good ability to last-hit minions thanks to his passive. But unlike Katarina, he also has good lifesteal synergy, whereas rushing Spell Vamp on Katarina isn't the greatest of ideas (you generally rush MPen as Kat).
