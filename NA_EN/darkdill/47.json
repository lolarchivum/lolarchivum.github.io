She is by far and away the most polarising mid right now. \nYes, the shield change is a good one, but if you're going to nerf ults for being too short a cd, at least look at one of the most polarising mid ults in the game. It does too much damage and has too much range for how short the cooldown is.\nEdit: and I went without mentioning her E. Mana cost high thus power budget earned but it's such a wide hitbox and it's so fast, also detonation being able to be buffered before the E lands means she can poke/zone fairly easily, as if you get near her E you run the risk of taking a Q then her popping E then R'ing you, then autoing you once, annihilating you.

I'd argue that a nerf to her shield was not the nerf she needed. I've often played against lux midlane (average 8 out of 10 times) both in rank and norms. Lux can still disintegrate you and her getting a worst shielding wont stop that. Nerfing her shield will just make her trash tier against assasins as of right now they are the only types who have a good chance of beating her ( namely {{champion:238}} and {{champion:55}}) I don't play lux, I honestly find her hard to play tbh as I never find an opportune time to land a root, but maybe that's because I rarely play her. I'd revert her shield nerf and nerf her dmg output. {{item:3285}} already gives her a lot, there's no need to avoid it Riot. I know you guys acknowledge she's strong but nerfing her shield is your sad attempt to tell the community (ok we nerfed her) while keeping her damage intact. She has support as a name tag for Nagakaborous Sake.

Thats the part of the kit that is frustrating and winning her games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RitoInvoker","date":"2016-03-09T11:32:47.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly if you nerf lux she might become useless.. lux's main problem is not her shield although that makes her much harder to kill....
