The game has never before been this cruel to me.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":126,"down_votes":22,"body":"**Disclaimer: salty rant about the current meta. Don&#039;t bother trying to read unless you&#039;re here to laugh at how pathetic we top laners have become.**\r\n\r\nI feel invalidated as a player. No matter what i do, i can&#039;t influence the course of the match anymore - if bot lane loses, the match is over at 07:00, if mid lane loses everybody gets blown up in the blink of an eye the moment they leave their base and if the enemy jungler is fed they can both face tank a tower and burst someone down from 100 to 0.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in top lane...\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#039;t matter if i&#039;m playing a tank, a bruiser or an assassin. Even before laning phase has ended, one of the other lanes has gotten completely dumpstered and as a result the enemy jungler has nothing else to do than to pressure me. Their winning lane will eventually come along and i will be forced to give up two towers.\r\n\r\nEvery other role in the game has an impact when they get ahead. Top laners do zero. You&#039;re just one player in a game where quantity&gt;quality. \r\n\r\nExample is not based on any single game. It&#039;s more like a conglomeration of all the freak shows i&#039;ve witnessed since preseason begun.\r\n\r\nNow i understand Riot wanted to get away from the one man army snowballfest of seasons past, but what&#039;s even the point with having a top lane at all? It feels like we&#039;re the new supports, in the aspect of what support used to entail back in season 1-3. You spend the entirety of laning phase barely surviving an extremely harsh dueling lane where you have to constantly watch out for a jungler or mid laner that can blow you up faster than you can flash, and all you get to build is tank items so that you can be a meat shield for your team. You can&#039;t possibly focus on outtrading your lane opponent, because if you build a damage item you&#039;re not going to have the resistances required to survive the full combo of the various damage types featured in the entire enemy team. Damage types massively boosted by new keystones only available to certain classes of champions. Your keystone is always melee-based - and nearly every champion in the game has ways to ensure you will never get into melee range with them.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn&#039;t mean you need to go FULL tank, right? One black cleaver, a trinity force, a titanic hydra couldnt hurt, right?\r\n\r\nYes. Yes it can. In fact, if you even think about building anything that doesnt benefit the entirety of your team, you may very well decide the outcome of the match from that one item purchase.\r\n\r\nBecause your assassin jungler is too busy finishing his third duskblade. Your mid laner is still building their morellonomicon 30 minutes later. Your adc is working on their {{item:3085}} {{champion:119}} and the support {{champion:63}} is building {{item:3504}}. \r\n\r\nIf you dont go tank, nobody else will. And then there&#039;s nothing standing between these full offense teammates of yours and the enemy super fed *insert snowballed role here* that is drooling so much their adc is wondering why their support hasn&#039;t warded this new river yet.\r\n\r\nOf course, these glass cannons are also so afraid to die that they will run away at the first sign of trouble. If you get caught, tough luck - you&#039;re obviously inting.\r\n\r\nThey get engaged on and you peel their assailant off them? Wave as they never look back, high-tailing it back to base to refill that 5% HP they lost.\r\n\r\nThey ping you to go in and you do? You&#039;re now being attacked from every direction by 4 opponents while your teammates (yes, all 4 of them) panic flashes away from the enemy jungler diving into them all alone. Yeah, that full tank jungler that ends the game doing less damage than both supports.\r\n\r\nWhat am i supposed to do, as a top laner? Do i have to duo queue with a tank jungle main and abuse the heck out of {{champion:84}} or {{champion:105}} before electrocute gets nerfed? Do i have to switch to being a jungle main to be given even the most remote impact on the course of the game? \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried jungling. It&#039;s my off-role. And i absolutely hate it - because every time i do, my top laner will lose their lane extremely hard - even if they counterpick their opponent - and they&#039;ll have absolutely no impact on the game, whatsoever. \r\n\r\nIt doesn&#039;t matter what champion i play. If i&#039;m playing top lane, i can only pray matchmaking gave me teammates better than my opponents - because even if i teleport bot at level 2 and give my adc a double kill, you can be certain the enemy adc is going to be 5/1 by the time laning phase ends.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me this isn&#039;t your ideal state of the game. I figure this might be what makes the fun plays in the tournaments and on the streams, but i&#039;ve never been more miserable.\r\n\r\nPlease dont force me to quit the lane. It&#039;s the only one i truly enjoy playing. But as it stands, its completely unplayable as a solo player - i don&#039;t play lethality slave champions that just stack anything with &quot;lethality&quot; printed on it, so i can&#039;t do anything once the laning phase has ended.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-11-14T05:20:18.270+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":5,"body":"When did riot ever give a fuck about top lane?

That is a common low rank misconception - AD champions are just as strong as they have always been. \n\nYou wanna know why marksmen have been going through the roof?\n\nIts because AD champions havent been getting stronger - AP champions have. {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} \n\nMage supports were finally given proper items and is at last, after all these years, considered \"real champions\" like every other class and role. And as the supports became just as strong as all other champions, it caused a gigantic upset in a meta that for years had been shaped around supports being near-useless ward bots barely worth killing. Suddenly supports have just as much impact on the game as every other role - which means their abilities balanced around being weaker than everybody else were suddenly stronger than everybody else.\n\nSo no, AD champions are not being favoured. Supports are.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Garen Support","date":"2017-11-15T12:49:48.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Low rank really? I am a platinum player.

Diamond 2 and low master are the middle ranks. high master and challenger are the high ranks. \n\nDue to the majority of the playerbase being low ranks they do not realize just how big the impact of the supports are. They think the adcs are the ones that are busted.\n\nThing is, once you see that 8/0 Tristana jump alone into mid lane and get 1-shot by the 0/3 Syndra, or get 1v1'd by the 2/0 Ornn, you'll quickly realize that the supports are the true masterminds behind the \"adc meta\". It's the huge amount of shields, attack buffs (both damage and attack speed) and large amounts of defensive crowd control that makes them so strong. \n\nTristana is currently the Irelia of bot lane. Vayne has always been the riven of bot lane. Both snowball massively, both deal huge base damages and both have near uncounterable late games. That doesn't necessarily mean they are busted - they are supposed to be strong in the late game, after all.\n\nTheir supports are the ones letting them reach that \"late game\" 8 minutes into the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-11-15T17:21:27.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's in EUW though, so he is a much better player to be Diamond EUW.\n\nYou also fit arguments to make you seem right always.

In the current meta you need to roam, win lane and then farm. Seriously. Both top laners were level 4 when bot lane's tower fell. I was jungling this game, so i could actually impact the rest of the map - but the top laners had no agency whatsoever. They just traded lanes as the bot laners switched to top lane, and then they kept farming. \n\nAt the moment, bot lane is decided long before top laners have had time to even back once. So you either do a super early teleport to bot lane and try to change what's happening down there (thereby sacrificing your own lane and falling really far behind in both levels and gold) or you simply farm and let the bot laners decide how the next 30 minutes of the match is going to pan out.\n\nOf course, this is different in the lower ranks. On my smurf account (that is currently Platinum 3) the games are MUCH slower paced, and snowballing top laners can often 1v2 or even 1v3 opponents. It's as if the ranks below diamond are still playing league of legends in season 5. \n\nBut at the very least, in low (and in higher, i presume) diamond the games are often decided before 10:00. Top laners have no impact whatsoever unless they play supports or hyper assassins like {{champion:84}}.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2017-11-14T13:10:22.363+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Frontline Fury,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JZxMuG3E,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-14T05:58:16.986+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s as if the ranks below diamond are still playing league of legends in season 5. \n> \n> But at the very least, in low (and in higher, i presume) diamond the games are often decided before 10:00. \n\nSounds like us low ranks are having more fun than the top ranks. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2017-11-14T17:27:56.155+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=It Hertz When IP,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JZxMuG3E,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-11-14T13:10:22.363+0000)\n>\n> Sounds like us low ranks are having more fun than the top ranks. ^-^\n\nYou are.

The way you win top these days is to absorb all the pressure on the map.

Either I kill everyone who comes top (not that hard with illaoi or jax) and continue pushing which forces even more people top (typically adc and sup will come from base at that point) with my team now having an open map and plenty of breathing room to push and take towers OR I backoff and repeat the procces/get caught out and my team still has plently of breathing room to take towers, farm, catchup etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fotios567","date":"2018-11-03T02:22:53.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yeah, but that's not FUN, and in the end of the day this is a video game to be played for fun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2017-11-14T22:49:27.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"this reeks of someone who probably wants darius buffs\n\nbut everything you said is true. upvoted and approved by a top lane main","replies":[]}]}
