Its just words, people need to learn how to socialize.\n\nYou can swear, but just not at others. The moment that you start swearing and cussing others out is when you can be punished for verbal harassment/abuse. From the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**What's the point of having a language filter if I can get banned for 'adult' language?**\nWe aren't out to punish players who use adult language; in fact, very few players are ever banned for saying stuff like \"f***, I missed that skill shot\" or \"damn, f***ing close game!\" However, the language filter is not an excuse to verbally abuse someone in the game. When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\n>**Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?**\nPlayers shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player.\n\nAlso, you aren't punished for just one or two or three \"slip-ups\", but for consistent negativity instead. If you can't use the chat in a neutral or positive manner then just don't use it at all whatsoever.\n\nP.S. Other people behaving worse than you will never ever excuse your own poor behavior. That will only result in the both of you being punished rather than just the original one raging jerk instead.\n\nP.S.S. Your poll is biased.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-05-31T09:42:13.772+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha.

Some of those game aren't pvp but Co-op focused. As for blade and souls it's 1 vs 1 and has no one to rage against but yourself. Am  I saying that this excuses the community overall? NO IT DOESN'T, it's still annoying when someone is tilting and you should report him. This also counts if this person is being annoying as  a response to other people being annoying.\n\nAnd that fucking poll at the end is just sad.
