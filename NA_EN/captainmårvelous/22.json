That out of the way, we got Swain's rework and...frankly, it paints Swain and Noxus in a very interesting, telling light. To be blunt: Noxus is no longer the bad guy. They're the guy who gets the job done.\n\n#Swain's New Lore: What we know.\n\n_\"I have seen this place. A vision...a battle...\"_\n\nSwain, for as far as we know, is still the Grand General of Noxus supplanting Darkwill after his convinent demise. From the looks of it, he still keeps ties with the Black Rose and more. We also know that Swain lost his arm to Irelia during the Ionia-Noxus war and that he's supplanted it with the demonic-empowered arm.\n\nThis will be updated with new color lore.\n\n#Swain's Implications: A Tyrant out of Necessity\n\n_\"People often ask for a hero when a villain is what they truly need.\"_\n\nThe most fascinating thing I can gleam from Swain's lore, appearance, personality and quotes is that he's not doing this out of hatred. He doesn't loath Demacia. He doesn't despise Bilgewater. Hell, I don't think he even holds ill will to Ionia despite losing to them. What I do see, however, is a man who is acting out of things he knows. Things that are deeper threats.\n\nTake a look at some of his quotes:\n\n>\"All roads lead to Noxus...but all visions to Demacia.\"\n>\"We both move pawns in a grand game. And look at that; I'm winning.\"\n>\"They fight the mist above the seas, never looking beneath it.\"\n>\"A pattern, spreading. It has learned to be alive.\"\n>\"A king remains in the mist and another marches.\"\n\nFrom these quotes, while it could be that Swain gleams them from champion soul taking, it could be inferred that Swain is reading deeper into the lay of the world. He knows things about Runeterra that others would soon forget. Things that require a united front. It also ties into things like Noxus's rapid expansion across the world and the swelling army. Swain knows that trials await and he's preparing the world for them. But the most important part is from his own teaser trailer. Which we'll get into next.\n\n#Swain as a Person: No Hiding the Demon.\n\n_\"Your trust may be misplaced, old friend, but it is appreciated.\"_\n\nSwain makes no efforts to hide that what he's doing is barbaric, cruel and monstrous. Everything he does is done out of necessity for both himself and Noxus. These are most apparent in his lines with LeBlanc but can also be seen elsewhere. Swain is blunt and forthcoming: What he's doing is, for lack of a better word, shitty. But it's something that has to be done. Swain understands on some level that this world won't survive if you all try to hold hands and be a goody goody two-shoes about it. Rather, he's going to be the person who is seen as a tyrant but remembered as a hero. Just take a look at his reveal quote:\n\n>\"I have the vision to see what others cannot. The monsters of today will be the heroes of tomorrow. And by my hand will Noxus rise once more.\"\n\nHowever, this also means that Swain understands this will only be for the victor. He has to win. He has to be the one standing on the hill at the end of the day. To accomplish this, he has to do everything in his power to make sure that Noxus's flag is the one still waving, even when the world is crumbling around him. This also means he has to keep some less-than-kind bedfellows like the Black Rose. It also means he could discard friends (such as Darius) in a heartbeat. No matter what, in the end, he has to win.\n\n#End Takes\n\nSwain represents the new direction of Noxus. A nation that is not evil for the sake of being evil but recognizes what it takes to win. They're a nation of cuthtroats, backstabbers and cruelty but a nation that recognizes backstabbing today means a hero's welcome tomorrow. I, for one, am excited to see what other champs either fit into this new vision of Noxus or rebel against it.\n\nWith that said, feel free to share your thoughts and your own takeaways from Swain's new look and voice.

Noxus actually did have issues with outside powers. It's implied that that was why Swain seemed to hide a lot of his powers until the battle at Kalamanda, and even after that rarely using them. Noxians weren't super trusting of outsiders, and who's powers were more \"outsider\" than a guy turning into a giant demon bird?\n\n\nI support Noxus, for the most part. I'm not arguing against them. But I'm also not going to deny that they were almost comically evil at times in the Old Lore, outside of a few things with Kat. They stirred up trouble for no reason, treated other nations poorly (they were, admittedly, treated poorly by the other nations as well), and were clearly just meant to be a dark and evil foil to demacia. I appreciate the ruthlessness and ambition that it demands of its citizens, but I'm also going to point out that there were a ton of flaws to it in its old version. It was just a super evil place. It didn't feel a lot like a dark magical roman empire to me because they seemed to just do a lot of bad with no good. They had reasons for invading Ionia, but they were self-serving and probably self-destructive, while new noxus seems to have a much more focused goal and idea of what its place in the world is. It doesn't even feel as much like a counterpart to Demacia, though maybe that'll be proven wrong. It actually feels like its own nation state with its own merits and flaws instead of an evil foil that, even if it was cooler than demacia, was still seemingly just a place to throw the magical bad guys into.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2018-01-24T22:03:55.716+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct; Old old noxus -- JoJ era -- was xenophobic against anyone who was strange to them. This was skull mountain era. Thefrostyviking might be thinking of the more recent developments, which are actually still pretty old at this point, come to think of it. That might be why lines seem to be crossed. By the time Sion's rework came around, Noxus was already moving solidly into the \"merit for merit's sake\" era, we just didn't have the chance to publish a faction update then.\n\nThe development of these factions isn't a cut and dry thing and they usually involve some degree of transition, which is why both of you are technically right! For instance, for the Noxian crest, there was an in-between version of it that clearly showed the transition visually. It was still clearly very evil (a fancy version of the JoJ era crest) but it was starting to trend toward the dark+magical style more and had almost purely gothic influences. Later, it developed a blend of gothic+brutalism. Sion's rework happened at the tail end of this transition, which is why his design is consistent with the current Noxian style. \n\nAs for DragonIgnis' original comment that the core of Noxus is the same, yes it is, from Sion's time! Probably not entirely the Noxus from the JoJ time period, though. And since then, we've also worked out more specifics of the nation, so there are new details from when Sion was released. \n\nTldr; everyone's technically right, it's just when you were referencing it.

It was with committed faith in this ideal that Riven strove to greatness. She showed early potential as a soldier, forcing herself to master the weight of a long sword when she was barely its height. She was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death.\"\n\nI can't say i know if Riven´s ideal matched reality terribly well, but that ideal should have been the official message though, at least that is the impression one gains reading her first lore.\n\nThat's why i wrote the way i did, since Riven is a pretty long time champ (been around longer than i have) and her oldest lore draft should have matched the first or at least earlier noxus ones.\n\n\nSo my view of Noxus was always this nation that promoted that ideal to their citizens but in truth all the topmost guys were the kind of people who would promote Machiavelli as a cultural idol.\n\nSo lots of scheming and ruthless efficiency, and not the type that monthy python's spanish inquisition dealt in but rather towards a blend of Gengis khan and Ceasar, brutal, efficient, highly developed military(for the times) and rather cold towards any not considered their own.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2018-01-25T19:38:31.041+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excerpt from the old Noxus info from ancient wikis: \n\n\"The citizenry of Noxus generally stands behind the principle that \"only the strong survive\", regarding the qualities of benevolence and compassion as signs of weakness.

Non-humans are, at best, made to feel unwelcome within the borders of this city-state. There are exceptions to this, but only after the non-humans in question have proven themselves to be either useful or feared (or both). Human visitors and immigrants to Noxus are made to feel only slightly better, again proving themselves only by either demonstrating competence or inspiring terror in their enemies.\"\n\nAnd here's an old JoJ article showing that Yordles were not welcome :( \n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_02\n\nSo, in the past, it was a meritocracy.... with some fine print.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-01-25T21:13:19.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh alright, thank you for the info.\n\n,,,,,,,\n\nBut wait a sec, in that text it states that noxians xenophobia rarely go beyond insulting, \n\nAnd katarina claims that the entire thing is false and that yordles are in fact highly skilled at ranged weaponry, something about pointing it at people.\n\n.....Doesn't this kinda imply that the average Noxian look down on Yordles becuase they think Yordles are small and weak?\n\nEvidently the more well informed ones like Kata don't seem to share the sentiment?

Again, that's why I think it's kinda confusing as old-lore Noxus did have both those elements in it. From my own personal point of view (as a fan and not a rioter), dropping the xenophobic aspect made way for gains in other aspects of Noxus -- like the expansionism and ruthlessness.

Get's recruited by one of the noble factions or maybe the faction of a commoner who rose up to prominence on their own.\n\nWhich seems to be what Swain did towards Darius and Draven, and he was also \"outcast\" as he puts it at some point, by whom?

I always hated the guy but loved the articles), but I'm glad to see that Noxus is actually moving into a grey area where there are pros and cons to them, just like Demacia. I feel like Noxus and Demacia will actually be tied together without feeling like forced parallels of each other.\n\nBasically, I think that the lore is definitely a step up from what it used to be, and the moral debate between the ideologies of Noxus and Demacia seem more interesting now that Demacia also has flaws beyond being jerks to the nation that everyone hates. Makes it less of a good vs. bad, more of a lesser of two evils scenario.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-01-24T05:18:32.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your interpretation of this. but im not sure if i actually agree with Swain here! it raises so many questions ( depending on wether all the information mentioned here turn out to be accurate)\n\nYou keep mentioning \"get it done\" \"needs to be done\" \"wont survive if you try to hold hands\"\nwhat are these actions that needs to be done? he sees the world as black and white as that? that \"winning\" is everything? what he is trying to do?\n\nWhat is his vision? and ultimately whats his agenda? save the world? so at the end he is the good guy?\nif not then world domination? united Runettera under his banner which means he is after power and control?\n\nWhats the point of winning a war when there is no one left to celebrate it?! and what does this means \"but a nation that recognizes backstabbing today means a hero's welcome tomorrow\"?backstabbing into what end? doing such a thing will forever mark you as a tyrant who do anything in the name of survival not a hero.\n\nI think you giving these cruel backstabbers and cutthroats a bit too much credit, making it about more than just their personal gains or lust for whatever it is that they are looking for.it is clear that many of them are here just for their own achievements! and not for the better of the world or their nation. thats a plus for Swain to use those to further his own goal.\n\nMy guess is that Swain wants unity through domination and that is not going to work under current circumstances, not with the Void knocking the great gates of Runettera down.Noxus is powerful and big but there are too many power houses at play here,too many oppositions for him.\n\nTime is short,Runeterra is vast, you'd think holding hand is actually the only way to get through something as terrible as Void.\n\nThis land is going burn while kings like Jarvan and grand generals like Swain are bickering over domination,thinking they got what it takes to \"get things done\" ! that makes no one a hero it makes them just another one of many leaders who thought they knew better as their nation burned around them!\n\ni just LOVE this! this makes for an amazing read and a great story to follow!","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-01-24T20:32:37.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with handholding is that many of the nations of Runeterra are so self absorbed that there's little chance of them agreeing on anything. Demacia is super xenophobic, with one of its highest ranking soldiers even saying that there was no point in trying to understand the other nations, it's just demacia vs. the rest of the world. Bilgewater has its share of problems. Piltover is full of upper class people who seem to primarily only care about themselves, and Zaun isn't even really a unified city. Azir, meanwhile, is still trying to make Shurima into a promised land while also fighting Xerath and Renekton. Ionia might possibly join with others, but there are still questions about them, especially surrounding the whole Jhin issue. Mount Targon doesn't seem to care much about the rest of the world. They're anti-void, but they seem to be split into several cults, many of which seem to take issue with anyone voicing an opinion that goes against the norm. And Freljord... well, we know what's going on with Freljord\n\nSwain's way of doing things may not be perfect, but from what we've seen of the rest of Runeterra, at least he has an idea of how to unite them. Swain actually seems far more likely to try dominating another country than Demacia, I think. Jarvan and other Demacians don't really seem to relish the thought of going outside their borders. There's scary magic people out there, you know. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying Swain's way of doing things is perfect, far from it, but he at least is working towards his goals. Diplomacy seems like a lost cause on Runeterra, he seems to be taking the approach of uniting the world through the only language everyone appears to understand: overwhelming might.\n\nYou make good points, though. I think that the way you're approaching it would work in the real world. Runeterra just seems to be a very different place, stuff that works here just might not work for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-01-25T16:39:55.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes what you said about each nation is exactly my point as well, too many different views too many different ideas its just like real world, each nation want to do their own thing or just dont care. Noxus is no different either, it is only their leader who see things differently but is that enough?! dictatorship tends to backfire at you at somepoint.\n\nYou'd think maybe \"if you dont come to some sort of_ temporary_ agreement with others,you all gonna perish\" would be enough for them to come off their high horses against something such as Void but no, seems like the alternative is what Swain has in mind. the thing is we cant confirm that threat of void is actually happening and if its happening, you would be a mad man who scream the end of times in streets of Runettera. making people believe ,would be a massive challenge of its own.\n\nAlthough i understand what Swain wants to do and i relish the thought that at atleast someone knows something big is coming, i dont think sheer overwhelming might is going to work here, because of so many powerful players in Runettera. he need more than Might, because when bloodbath of domination ends how many soldiers are left to fight off whatever is coming next?!\n\nAbout what you said regarding this approach,that it would  work in real world and not Runettera, im not sure how. i mean we do have records in our history that nations who do not agree with each other come to terms to fight off something bigger. and instead of Galio and other Demigods we have Nuclear bombs and weapons of mass destruction xD","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-01-25T17:38:35.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone gets along in our world, yes, but some groups do get along. We have the U.N. which at least tries to have people working together, and even the U.S. and Russia have worked together on space stuff. There's a history of cooperation. Yes, there are wars, but there are also truces and alliances.\n\nRuneterra seems to have no alliances. It seems more like a bunch of different places that all just want their own thing with no regard for the others. Hell, Demacia especially seems like an easy target for any coming darkness since they seem to almost refuse to leave the safety of their forest, instead sitting and defending. I think that what Swain could do it conquer some places, a slightly easier task since no one is united, and then once that happens he could use his new power to force a peace meeting of some sort. He'd probably just go the domination route, but he could still try for some level of peace.\n\nI think that, in the context of Runeterra and its history at least, Swain's plan has some degree of merit. I think a good display of force is what's necessary to make people listen, trying to warn the other nation states seems sort of like trying to get some screaming children to listen: it's not going to work. If Swain can prove some degree of power, it would probably be easier to get others to listen to him.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-01-24T03:55:24.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Valuing strength above all, knowing that you are doing wrong but being ruthless enough to do it, and using whatever means necessary to gain power _is_ evil.\n\nJust ask my main, Taliyah.

He isn’t some evil dictator that wants power for powers sake, he’s a ruthless man who realizes Valoran must be united to face the void invasion, a possible shadow isles invasion, the frozen watchers, and whatever else may be coming.  I find it very unlikely that all of Valoran would unite before it was too late unless one person is controlling everything, mainly because of Demacia being too stubborn to accept magic, and the Frejlord not being united in the first place.  I think Valoran is better off having a merciless dictator that will keep the world alive, rather than being destroyed by the void and shadow isles.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-01-24T18:02:54.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=wackywert,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vPGH9Hhy,comment-id=000e000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-24T13:44:21.880+0000)\n>\n> I disagree that using whatever means necessary to gain power is evil, at least when you have Swain’s end goal.

Besides some whispers and old scrolls, we have no reason to believe that claim, and he certainly has presented no evidence.  Next, he believes that the world will fail to defend itself.  Time and again, it has proven otherwise, defeating all manner of terrible foes.  Last, he argues that only by making him ruler of the world could its forces be marshaled to defeat the coming threat.  That is a self-serving argument from a scheming emperor, and there are plenty of reasonable alternatives.\n\nSwain could have devoted himself to preparing the world for the invasion he claims to foresee.  He could be organizing an alliance, holding meetings, writing plans, recruiting volunteers, and procuring materièl.  He has instead lead a massively destructive invasion of the entire planet.  Accordingly, we should read between the lines and of his argument and see it for the pretext it is.\n\nEven if our backs are put to the wall, our lives in the balance in a struggle against some monstrous foe, we should not abandon what made them worth living.  Peace.  Justice.  Freedom.  Let Swain say what he wants about what must be done: these words are worth risking everything for.","replies":[{"poster":"Wert the Wacky","date":"2018-01-24T20:26:23.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you have a fair point, I think Valoran would be more free and peaceful under the unified rule of Noxus anyway.
