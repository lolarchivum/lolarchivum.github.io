However, there are other changes too on there that aren't mentioned anywhere and that have never been mentioned in any patch notes since I started taking my break from playing. The two changes I see now are:\r\n\r\n1. W lasts 5 seconds. For years it has lasted only 4 seconds even though reading the ability description said 5. I had tested that several, several times and it was one of the first things I tested for on PBE.\r\n2. You can dash/blink out of Fizz's Q. That's a huge change that I don't see mentioned anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd it turns out that these aren't just PBE changes that nobody noticed. These changes are actually on Live **right now** and not a word has been said about either of them. The 2nd change in particular is huge and totally changes how you can play against him, yet it got stealth changed into the game so nobody knows about it to take advantage of it. This isn't the only time this kind of thing has happened even just with Fizz. A few months back, his E was changed where if you use Zhonya's during it, it saves his spot in the animation instead of finishing it and doing damage during the Zhonya's stasis, but absolutely 0 mention of that in any patch notes.\r\n\r\nI'm not complaining about any of these changes. Most of them are actually good changes that should have been made, but why is it so hard to put big things like this in patch notes? This happens for tons of other champions too, and it's really annoying learning that something changed and not being told about it until it screws you over in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-01-26T20:27:04.697+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, our bad there, that Fizz Q change should have either been patch noted or not gone out.

I remember seeing one designer (I think Daniel Z Klein) talking about changing his Q that way and the same for other champs with targeted dashes. So I was kinda surprised to see it went live without being mentioned anywhere, but I do think it's better this way so I don't mind too much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Demonsolder21","date":"2015-01-26T01:15:46.176+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another change is stealth wards.
