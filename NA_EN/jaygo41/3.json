They're generally not.\n\nTo be a competitive jungler right now you need to be able to compete with cancer junglers like Nidalee and Elise in the early game. That is the only prerequisite to being a competitively viable jungler. The vast majority of champs cannot do this and as such can never be picked outside of extreme circumstances.\n\nIf you want any diversity in competitive jungling you need to systematically remove the strongest early game junglers. Right now that's Nid, Elise and Rek'sai, once you did that Lee, Graves and possibly a couple of other similar champs would be in the same position. If you once again remove those junglers you might see the viable jungle population rise from 4-5 to 8-9.
