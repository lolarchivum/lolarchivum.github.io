Haven't created an art thread on the Boards since the overhaul, but now...it's time! Over the past few years, I've been creating a lot of League art, including skin ideas. Here are the newest skin sketches for the most recent champs (eventually, I'd love to return to older champs). Hope you enjoy, I'll be updating these whenever I can.\n\nAlso included really rough sketches for Bard. Any input/feedback is always welcome! \n\nMy old thread in the forum archive: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1183706\nAnd my deviantart if you'd like to see more: http://vegacolors.deviantart.com/\n\nEdit: Thanks a bunch for the comments and feedback! I really appreciate it.
