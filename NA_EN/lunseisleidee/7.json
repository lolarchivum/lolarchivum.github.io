Each of the  Champions released in 2017 felt more juvenile in design and far less creative. The gameplay is always good; but the visuals regressed to a somewhat generic anime stuff.\n\nSo, looking back at the releases from 2015 to 2016, we have:\n\n* {{champion:432}} Bard\n* {{champion:245}} Ekko\n* {{champion:223}} Tahm Kench\n* {{champion:203}} Kindred\n* {{champion:420}} Illaoi\n* {{champion:202}} Jhin\n* {{champion:136}} Aurelion Sol\n* {{champion:163}} Taliyah\n* {{champion:240}} Kled\n* {{champion:427}} Ivern\n* {{champion:164}} Camille\n\nYou've implied that you liked Tahm Kench (maybe?  Maybe I infer too much) but how else do you rate these, according to your tonal tastes.  Many would say that tonally, Kled is a world away from Illaoi, who is a world away from Bard, for example.  Is there a common thread tying the ones you felt were more your style?\n\nThen, of course, we're comparing skins to champs.  You're not a fan of the Star Guardians - that's totally cool - but is there a skin line, or set of skin lines you do enjoy seeing more of?  (I know lots of other players have posted threads on skin lines they'd like to see revisited - not sure if you've contributed to those conversations or not.)\n\nI am also interested in whether or not you've been keeping up with some of  the longer form stories, or if that's not your jam.  You mentioned that the Darius, Blood of Noxus, comic didn't satisfy, and that's fine, but were there other stories in the past that scratched that itch?  How about Burning Tides and Shadow and Fortune?  Bloodlines?  The For Demacia story, or the ones from Piltover and Zaun?  If any of those were closer to your preferences, call em out so we know what length, maturity level, tone, style, etc. gets closer to your preferences.","replies":[{"poster":"LunSeiSleidee","date":"2017-08-23T18:20:50.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I said I like all the champions of 2015 and 2016, I do mean I like all of them!! Perhaps the issue is that after two years of always seeing new releases that I appreciated without a single miss, it felt weird to me to get a 2017 with all releases I don't like. I got used to the idea I was going to like every new character, regardless of wether I'd love them and play them (Tahm or Taliyah) or just appreciate them even if I don't play them personally (Kindred or Ekko).\n\nIf I try to think about what made such a difference, it's that all of the 2017 releases look more cliché both in concept and in visuals. Xayah and Rakan and Kayn are more or less typical anime people; none of the 2015-2016 releases looked that canonically stereotyped.\nOf course, this is a game which in the past had decidedly anime-looking characters, so it's not something new. But I guess the 2015-2016 period spoiled me particularly.\n\nAll in all, I don't mind if I don't like a champion because I can always like another. Obviously I couldn't ask for every character to appeal to me. But it's the weird occurence of two years of designs I liked versus one year of designs I don't like which baffled me.\n\nStory-wise, I don't appreciate sudden lore changes, even if I can see how they make sense in improving the narrative and making it more entwined and coherent. So while it was baffling to me at first to see Warwick switch from magical werewolf created by Soraka to biochemical werewolf created by Singed, I can't really complain about it as I can see the logic behind the decision.\n\nIf I were to say which story I liked the most.... I don't know if it counts as a story since it was an audio file, but I reeeally like the Tahm Kench fairy tale told by Tahm Kench himself (sidenote, I listened to it in the Italian dubs because I'm a fan of localizations - but I'm guessing the English dubs were the same!).\nJust a few years ago I had a thing for fairy tales. I read a looot of them and I read essays on them. It probably came as a reminiscence of my childhood: when I was little, I had these vinil discs which narrated fairy tales, and I would sit on the floor and listen to them again and again for hours.\nAnd then many years later, I listen to the Tahm Kench story and it's the same. It follows the structure and the deepest intricacies of fairy tales. And it's narrated too, just like those vinyl discs I had as a child.\nSo you see, it's things like that which make me appreciate League so much. It feels like there's a depth, a study, to the atmosphere and characters.\nI like it when characters are an exercise of style, wits and creativity, that can be appreciated both by those who simply want a \"cool\" character and by those who want to look at a character concept like a little work of art.\n\nAnd then I see Kayn or Xayah and sure there is a study behind those characters, but for some reason I call that study \"cold marketing\".\nMaybe I'm being unjust only because I don't like them. Surely there must have been marketing behind Tahm or such as well, but I didn't see it, while I can see the marketing behind the 2017 releases too clearly for my tastes.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI got so very, very talkative that I omitted the discussion about skin/skin lines.\nPersonally, I like skins which change a character's concept, so I end up playing someone I wasn't interested in playing before. I don't like Hecarim as some ghost knight who reminds me of DotA2; I like him as a cyborg rainbow unicorn centaur (afterwards I discovered it referenced a game called Robot Unicorn Attack; but all I knew is that cyber robot unicorn felt more interesting). I already love Nidalee as a coguar (sabretooth tiger?) but I LOVE her as an alien huntress. I really don't like how silly Caitlyn looks, but Pulsefire Caitlyn is such a badass. And so on. I like it when a skin gives a very different interpretation of the character.\n\nI don't like skin lines (star guardians etc.) as I think they limit creativity; but if they're so popular I guess I can accept them.\n\n.....Sorry for how awfully long this reply was.

Part of the problem you face is you extrapolating three champion releases in a roster of 138.  \n\nJust because champions from Ionia do not suit your fancy doesn't mean that League is going in a \"bad direction.\"  That is the definition of a slippery slope fallacy.  It may just be League trying to include a certain demographic.  In this case, it was those who are in love at a younger age (Xayah and Rakan), and those who love seeing cold-hearted badasses (Kayn).  Their designs have an eastern or \"anime\" influence as you put it, because their region is Ionia.  \n\nYou were blessed with a continuous two year time period in which every champion released was perfect for you.  However, it is wrong for you to say you *personally* deserve to be catered to.  Perhaps people disliked bard because he never had a voiceline that wasn't musical, or perhaps they hated Aurelion Sol for not being Ao Shin.  I personally hated it when Diana got a blood moon skin, and I complained about it.  Guess what?  It didn't change a thing, because more people wanted the skin.  But life still went on and I found new things to adore.  I get that you don't like anime, or that you don't like \"edge\"  because you certainly sound like a thirty-some world-weary adult, but they are players too, and they deserve champions that they can cherish just as much as you do.  \n\nNow onto skin lines.  You complained HEAVILY about Star guardians, but have you considered the rest of the skins that Riot released this year?  Arcade, Lancer Zero, Pentakill, Omega Squad, SKT, VS. skins, Soul Hunter, Chemtech, Pulsefire, Cosmic, Dreadnova, God Fist, Toy Set, Dragon Sorceress/Slayer, Festival, Heartseeker, and blood moon.  Because Riot releases one, maybe two (if you count blood moon) \"anime themed\" skin sets, suddenly everything else is useless?  Are you seriously saying that they have no variety?  I think that that *particular* point you made is completely asinine.  Maybe you feel out of place with Star guardian, and hey, for the most part, so do I, because I don't any hold special love for the magic girl genre.  Except to a bias such as yours, all anime is the same, and holds no value, or meaning.  I think you need to reevaluate exactly which demographic you want to protest against, because honestly, I think you're using some vicious stereotypes to generalize the anime community.  \n\nFinally onto my last point: you seem to think that league follows a single path, when in reality, it's a bunch of parallel paths that complete at different times.  Star guardian skins were in development at the same time that the Omega Squad skins were being worked on.  Just because one path doesn't lead where you want it to doesn't mean the entirety of the company is following that path.  If you want all the paths to point in the direction you choose, I think we all can see who is actually being immature here.   \n\nYou only either post to complain about content that you don't agree with, or praise new content for *specifically not being the content you disagreed with.*  I think that that behavior, *especially* in an adult is incredibly immature.  Furthermore, you usually rebuff counterarguments with the same rhetoric:  either by ignoring/acting indifferent when you can't come up with a proper response, or devolving into self pity, ie. \"you're saying I should uninstall because I'm too old.\"  The few times you actually do offer some useful suggestions, they're usually paired with some heavy criticisms of what you disagree with, ie \"make champions like bard, Camille, and Aurelion Sol and not edgy weeb champs like Kayn.\"  That's not positive feedback, that's demonizing previous work.  It's this manner of speaking that incentivizes people to disagree (read flame) with you, even if you actually have a valid request.  You've made a false dilemma: either you agree with me and are a mature player, or you disagree with me and you're either an edgy child, weeb trash, or immature.  That is a change you need to make within yourself before you can start telling others how they should think.  \n\nTLDR; three champions and one skin line don't define all of league nor do they represent the entirety of Riot's future plans.  You need to stop viewing these as a step by step progression of events and start realizing that different teams work on different content simultaneously with deadlines that they reach one-by-one.  Stop demonizing both Riot and the players who enjoy characters like Kayn, Xayah and Rakan, and stop pretending like Star Guardian Skins define future skin releases.  Every skin or champ is not going to appeal to you, just as it isn't going to appeal to me; find what you love, and cherish it for existing.  Don't criticize others for what they love and the content they want because it exists.  They deserve it just as much as you, and don't get me wrong, YOU DO DESERVE IT.  It's just that every dog has its day, and this time, it was Star Guardian fans.","replies":[{"poster":"LunSeiSleidee","date":"2017-08-24T07:29:04.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"K.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-08-24T19:11:19.950+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you are not willing to listen to somebody, then why do you expect that courtesy to be extended to you?","replies":[{"poster":"LunSeiSleidee","date":"2017-08-25T09:08:18.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrekGoldenspear,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HAUHOjH8,comment-id=000e00000000,timestamp=2017-08-24T19:11:19.950+0000)\n>\n> If you are not willing to listen to somebody, then why do you expect that courtesy to be extended to you?\n\n\n\nHis post progessively became more and more insulting towards me.\n\nBe thankful I decided not to waste my time insulting him back.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-08-25T14:59:16.659+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh really?

Read the lore. Yes, the Darius comic was not deep, but it at least elaborated on a cliche in a unique fashion. Also, it took like three minutes to read, so you can't really judge it like that.\n\nThe lore is cool and one of the parts of League that I can DEFINITIVELY say is improving. Some of it's not updating though...\n\nAlso, just enjoy the game. You seem to have no problem with the gameplay, so keep doing you. Climb the ladder, etc. Find a skin line you like. Find a champion you really like. And just play the game.\n\nAbout your previous note of Riot looking at the boards: sometimes they do to a thread that has 50+ upvotes or a thread that directly addresses them, but usually they ignore it or say \"no, we can't do that\". So don't worry about that.\n\nGLHF","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-08-23T14:44:59.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excellent advice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-08-23T14:17:53.436+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see how asking for more villains is asking for more edgy. \n\nWhen I want more villains, I don't want people like Kayn.

True villains, especially when Riot tries to make certain characters sympathetic. \n\nVayne for example is a good villainous character because she's basically become the monsters that she's hunting. \n\nLissandra however despite being a villain is convinced she's doing the right thing. Urgot is just pushing his philosophy on people. They are bad guys but they don't view themselves as bad guys. \n\nWhen I'm asking for villains, I want more like Tahm or Mordekaiser. Villains who aren't justifying their actions because of philosophy or \"greater good\" but because they want to do it. Because they find it fun. \n\n\nAs for characters that are fully good, we also have Ashe, Lux, Poppy, Soraka, Janna, Taric, Nami, Galio, Zac, Blitzcrank, Wukong, etc. \n\nDefinitely more than on one hand. \n\nJust because I disagree with you doesn't mean I'm a troll.
