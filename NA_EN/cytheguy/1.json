Sub 50% winrates in every role, easy to beat with literally any laner. I said it before and I'll say it again: Soraka could beat Kayle in lane. That is before Kayle started taking Kleptomancy.\n\nThis keystone has been nothing but problematic for the game due to the way it behaves and how it counts a spellcast. They fixed this for Ezreal because he was abusing it so badly, except in his case he could also farm.\n\nI heard from someone on these Boards that Riot planned on nerfing Kayle Jungle if they saw her playing that role too much, because it was to circumvent her weak early game by placing her in a role that could minimize encounters with other champs. Well, people are definitely circumventing her weaknesses again by giving her an early source of gold from Kleptomancy. In lane she's supposed to struggle to cs and reach her item powerspikes, but now she can easily get to them by just poking people and sitting under tower in a safe zone because you can't dive her without 3-4 people hard engaging, and even then it'd be hard to get everyone out alive at that point.\n\nGive Kayle the Ezreal-Klepto treatment; make her e not count as a spell cast until the ranged auto lands, then give her the opportunity to hit someone for gold.\n\nI think after this people will go back to either not playing her or dedicating time to learning how to play her, and when those people figure it out they'll post guides and videos about how to do things and her playrate will go back up to a nominal rate. I have personally dedicated my time to learning how to jungle with her, but that's kinda hard now that she's almost permabanned because she has a bad reputation in top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2019-03-31T15:41:19.702+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":4,"body":"https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Kayle/\n\nHer winrate is higher with conqueror\nIt's still 55% with PtA, Grasp, or Comet\nIt's still over 50% with NINE keystones (out of a total of 17)\n\nKayle isn't strong because of Kleptomancy, Kayle is straight-up strong and Kleptomancy happens to be her best keystone.

Honestly, Riot is doing us a solid by keeping completely reworked champs available for these cheap prices.

It's only really great on champions that can abuse it, i.e., champions that have spells that also auto-attacks. It's mediocre on pretty much everybody else. It allows champions like Kayle and Ezreal who are supposed to have a weak early game to not only pad their health, mana, and vision control with the free items, but also use the free gold to accelerate themselves past their early game. \n\nI think Kleptomancy should store the gold you get from it in a sort of investment. The proc itself it a lot easier (e.g., any auto-attack/spell, not spell-then-attack), but the gold gets put away. You can't touch it. After a specific time, you get all the gold that's stored up in one lump sum, plus interest. \n\nThis would allow Kleptomancy to do what it's supposed to do (give you extra gold for staying in combat with enemy champions) without the acceleration.

When they can cast a spell that also counts as an auto-attack, they can proc it with less resources and commitment than other champions. They get around what is supposed to be a restriction on its use. \n\nFor comparison, Electrocute needs you to hit someone three times to get value. It's not restricted to champions that have specific three-hit abilities that can proc it instantly. Virtually any champion can use Electrocute. There are certainly those that use it better, but it's not useless without a specific mechanic that exploits how the ability is triggered.

Your description was completely worthless, you fail to understand how my examples expose this, and you contribute nothing to the conversation.\n\nKleptomancy users do have a mechanical advantage that is above and beyond how most champions use their keystones. Yes, a champion that is able to dump multiple cooldowns at once and proc Electrocute will use that keystone better than a champion that can't, but exploiting Kleptomancy with a spell-attack is different. It's taking advantage of how the keystone is used to circumvent what would normally be a restriction. Multi-hit or stacking keystones still require you to invest the resources, whether that's time, cooldowns, or energy/mana, to get their intended effect, but Kleptomancy users get around the normal requirement by bundling their attack together with the spell cast. \n\nThey aren't just better at proccing it than other champions, they proc it in a way that other champions can't. They aren't just doing it very fast or with better range than other champions, they're doing so without the restriction. That's why I put it a cut above normal use, and call it \"abuse\". They're abusing the fact that they can use the keystone far better than other champions, forcing the keystone to be balanced around them and making it even worse for everybody else.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2019-04-01T03:41:17.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Keystones are supposed to be balanced around the champions that use it.
