Because it reduces the chances of burning unnecessarily, thus got baited. It also adds an element of unpredictability because the enemies would be less likely to know your path of escape if you still have the Flash un-burned during the gank as it adds other pathing, and it also means the enemies might need to commit and burn their Flash too if they want to really chase you down.

If you don't think it'll kill you then don't burn flash unless you can't afford to leave right now due to lower hp.\n\nExample: Enemy pantheon is point and click stunning you and you'll die if he gets that extra auto attack off with his stun E auto Q combo, flash before it (or better yet don't get in range but say he burns flash to stun you) then you're not in auto range while you're stunned since you flashed just before the stun hit you. Meaning you will not die, otherwise you would have.\n\nOr say there's an ashe arrow flying at you, dodge it with the flash, get the ashe.\n\n\n\nOr to try and repeat the same thing in another way, flash so you don't get low in the first place, as the game could be won or lost based on how many times you have to back, and how late in the game you have to leave.\n\nNow I know I talk in circles a lot, give a lot of the same reasoning with different wording, but last time I promise.\n\nStay healthy, fight longer, there's more to flash than barely surviving, and more often than not if you flash when you're low you can die to something like a shaco E or pantheon Q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Awhegark","date":"2017-06-23T22:42:27.111+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am the third type always flashing into the CC no matter who I am playing.
