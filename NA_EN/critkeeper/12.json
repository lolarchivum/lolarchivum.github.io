Some champions even when they offer something others don't and do really well still won't have much if a pick rate simply because they don't look or feel appealing. Some champions had their visuals altered and minor changes just so they look appealing in hopes they would be picked more. Although, there's over 100 champs and expecting them all to be played equally is just a dream that won't ever happen. As long as there are people that enjoy a champion it should be fine, there's no reason to change champions purely for popularity as that usually doesn't work out well and usually means taking popularity from another champion anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2016-01-25T18:08:04.292+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excellent example of this is Gallio, he's not popular not because he's not balanced, but because his niche (punishing teams who are way too magic damage heavy) is not something that happens often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2016-01-25T14:16:14.682+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I started to play him before the rework.
