Fizz does *not* have anywhere near Ekko's durability nor utility as a tank. The only feasible way tank Fizz could possibly be a problem is if his W does too much damage. Even then, Fizz can be peeled, CC locked, and dealt with properly by an ADC. Fizz lacks innate sustained damage and utility, so if he doesnt combo the carry, he will die. Meaning he needs to use E to go in, leaving him 0 escapes.
