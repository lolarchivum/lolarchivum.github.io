Her ultimate is a bread-and-butter, low cooldown skill.

There's no reason for such a powerful, long range, and relatively fast moving ability to have any effect when it misses.\n\nI would have more sympathy if she completely relied on it to do her job. But even if she totally whiffs the E, she can still chuck out Q's every few seconds, and is bound to eventually hit something with them.

Lux's slow is considerably larger and also deals respectable damage (IK it's not the main catcher, however it provides a large set up for the catcher.)  Much harder to dodge while it's actively moving and is much bigger zone control (lasts longer as well and is AoE)\n\n\nThe main thing that separates them is that Zoe's main damaging abilities are tiny skillshots, and can be minion blocked.  Playstyles also differ by quite a margin.   Zoe's burst combo has a ton of set up and can be relatively easily dodged so is technically less reliable than Syndra and Lux.  However the number of times Zoe is able to do it makes it seem more reliable.   Considering she really only has two reliable damaging abilities (one of which is single target,  the other that can be blocked, it's pretty understandable.\n\nThat being said, Zoe likely will receive some small nerfs  likely to the Q,  not a definite yes, but Riot has stated they're monitoring her.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-11-27T04:39:28.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I wasn't stating my previous comment to debate. there is nothing to debate.

Therefore I infer that she is getting too much damage/utility out in situations in which she shouldn't be doing that.\n\nMy whole point basically is that even if you say her bubble is not reliable in practice it actually is. The three biggest culprits are situational long ranges using walls (this one is fine IMO), how large the AOE of E2 is and the R+E combo to engage.

But let&#x27;s focus on the fact the he&#x27;s coming up with new ideas rather than the usual 3 hit passive or auto attack reset with Max hp damage\n\nThis is long, but I need this much to cover and fully explain my stance all in 1 swoop. Bear with me.\n\nI can come up with a similar idea where a champion has 3 flashes, too (here I use 3 flashes as a metaphor that refers to all overloading that this guy does with his champs; like seriously, for example in the case of Zoe, their newest creation, does her E really need to also have damage amplification that doubles the damage taken for asleep targets, having soft reset mechanics when you hit E, to be an AoE trap if you miss, AND having range extension when hitting walls, all at the same fucking time, on top of already being a very good CC spell at the base given it already stuns people for 2 seconds? What is that E meant to be, an ultimate?). Just because it's not done by other designers because they typically have some idea about managing the power budget, doesn't mean the champion with 3 flashes I just came up with is \"coming up with new ideas\". \n\nHe's a guy who can somehow consistently make mistakes in the most ridiculous way that nobody else would be allowed to attempt even a fraction of what CertainlyT is doing without simply getting sacked or shoved somewhere, and somehow people actually praise and cheer him on for keep making bigger and bigger and often the very same mistakes that others already know to avoid for many various and obvious reasons; how fucked up is that? It is not \"not afraid to go out there with kit designs\", he's just a bad designer (for this game) with no semblance of balance nor restraint in their design, in a game where balance is crucial given its competitive nature; I use this analogy often, just because I take selfies with a loaded pistol to my head, whereas nobody else is doing it for obvious reason, it doesn't somehow make my actions ingenious on that basis.\n\nIt's not even like CertainlyT makes up more creative contributions overall, all of his champs is just 1 gimmick surrounded by a kit that would compliment that gimmick, usually the kit also supports outside of the gimmick that shouldn't go very far, which is exactly the same as all the other champions. The only difference is that CertainlyT's kits often support VASTLY outside of the central gimmick of the champion, or worse having the gimmick to be \"do fucking everything\", making their designs often doing FAR more than what's considered normal; again, having 0 restraint and respect to the overall of the game does NOT make you anymore creative or integral, but it will show that you just don't give a shit. You know when you're in a group project of any sort, and there will always be this one guy who's just doing their own thing with 0 complying with what the group is actually doing and the bits they've done is always hilariously out of sync with the group and always need to be seriously fixed before it can actually be used? CertainlyT is literally that guy, who can only interpret the notion of creativity and innovation via being vastly different to others for the sake of it and that they just can't hold themselves back from showing just how different and ingenious he is, **in the world full of sheeps!!11!!!** And that's all there is to it, the guy's a fucking showoff. \n\nThere are ways in which one can think outside of the box without beating people with it, Ivern was a good example (only only took 1 fix to put him in line, and he continues to be one of THE most instantly recognisable champs in the game). CertainlyT just doesn't get it and has to use the most obnoxious ways to desperately try and claim that he's different and more creative and blah blah than others. That's not someone who should keep cheering them on for making the same shitty mistakes again and again, we should be telling them in the face that they should actually communicate with the team and operate within the balance of the fucking game he's a part of. What kind of designer is even actually praised for breaking their own game and not respecting their own rules and balance, because we obviously don't endorse this kind of fuckery.......... unless you're called CertainlyT, in which case we praise you for making stupid mistakes, WHAT CREATIVITY AND THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX! Yeah okay.\n\nAlso, 3 hit passive was there because of class updates, it has very little to do with other designers and their design.","replies":[{"poster":"Count Lieberkuhn","date":"2017-11-28T17:27:23.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full agreement here.  Also a general theme of his champions is because they have massive kits, they have a lot more answers to a given situation than other champions.  While this is often misconstrued as outplaying an opponent, the truth is that it's only an outplay if your opponent has an equal amount of options to come out on top of a situation.  If they don't, then your 'outplay' was nothing more than having access to a solution your opponent did not have.  This is the root cause of the frustration of playing against his champions when you are playing one that follows the established rules of the game.\n\nInnovative designs that change gameplay dynamics without simply giving a champion more solutions for victory - just _different_ solutions - would include Ivern, Bard and Aurelion Sol.  Aurelion Sol is particularly interesting because he forces his opponents to play his game of positioning, but if his opponent positions better than they will beat him.
