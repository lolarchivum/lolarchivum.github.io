That's not an easy thing to do. Sion has gone from a joke, to a character that is not only meaningful and interesting on his own, but who has a story that has implications into the deepest aspects of Noxus.\r\n\r\nI always felt that the subtext to Swain's story that hinted at a not wholly great guy(by Noxus standards) was kind of glossed over after he became high-general. But this story and his treatment of Sion brings it back into new light. It also shows that the abrogation of the Noxus ideals(thanks to the Black Rose) are continuing even after the things that happened with the alliance with Zaun(if that stuff is still canon).\r\n\r\nAnyways good job story team.\r\n\r\n@Riot Opeli @Riotrunaan","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixSlayer13","date":"2014-09-28T03:31:11.265+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"The Sion storyline is an excellent example of staying faithful to the storyline of other characters involved while expanding the story of the main character.  I thought it was rather well done, and rewarded prior knowledge of lore.\n\nPeople seem to misunderstand that the entirety of old lore has been wiped away, when in reality it's just the Institute that's been removed.  While it's not necessarily confirmed, I'm pretty sure we can say that anything that happened that didn't involve the Institute still happened, until proven otherwise.  Even events that did involve the Institute can be changed accordingly.

The \"3 of the desert\" are warriors-like characters (even {{champion:75}}  to a small degree). Also, the main line seems to refer the Xerath's Ascension is corrupted but he /only source his quotes) is capable of seeing the very fabric of the Universe and nothing seems to contraddict that he would be omnipotent if not for the sarcophagus. \n\nWhat I fear though, is that we will be either left with nothing more in our hands (Shurima event has come to an end and many champions like {{champion:32}} haven't had a line in it) and it will be like this untill the next Shurima themed event/champion, or we'll be told by Riot: \"This is all, get over it\".\n\nWhat I (and most of others) are asking is for some more light on it or either to recosnider it if this is all in the same way that happened for another champion ({{champion:112}}).","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2014-09-29T18:18:09.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well..

Compare his old lore to new in-game presentation, especially voice lines (I don't care it's an ice troll), and it is just a different person. If they wanted a new champion to lead the trolls in the Freljord, make a new one. If you want Trundle to lead the trolls in the Freljord, make sure it's actually Trundle leading them. Worst thing is that the background actually came pretty close to being the same troll, though the in-game presentation is just horribly different.\n\nThis current state goes directly against preserving identities and I don't want to invest in lore in which my favorite characters could just be retconned and replaced with new ones next event.","replies":[{"poster":"SecretLore","date":"2014-09-29T11:19:56.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Trundle is really the only champ where you can say that they basically deleted the old champ and made a new one.\n\nMaking someone new to lead the trolls was a no go,because if riot does a concept,they'll do it only once(so there will be no second troll,no second ice witch,no second war demon,no second sand mage,etc.),but I think they should have kept more of the old trundle.\n\nBut then again,old trundles ingame quotes were all about smashing the enemies face and he was a bit cocky already,so at least he kept that aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-09-29T12:46:53.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Trundle was a troll constantly in pain and entirely willing to club anyone senseless from his in-game presentation, yes. The new Trundle is just plain power-hungry. He's just an evil mean troll trying to seize as much power as he can. This does not sound like the old Trundle, who was naïve but wanted his tribes admiration, he wanted to no longer be the bullied runt. When he took the curse and instead of getting their admiration he got their disgust for the curse they themselves once carried, he became cynical and stopped caring.\n\nParts of old Trundle are kept. It's just silly to see how close they got in the background, then how the details and the voice-over make it a new troll, as if they started with the right idea but got derailed.\n\nIf you need him to be king of trolls, he can't just shun his tribe. Why not make him protect his tribe out of a sense of duty yet loathe them for their weakness? You have this ambiguity back of Trundle who wants his tribes admiration but also kind of knows they're a bunch of small-minded *insert random insult*.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure we even know ice trolls existed before Trundle became one. They could've put just about anything in his place.","replies":[{"poster":"PerchancetoGame","date":"2014-09-30T15:41:20.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What appeals to me about the Trundle ret-con (and this is just me, not supposed to be a reason why it's better overall than the original, just why I happen to like it more) is the very realistic concept of a guy seizing power in his community because he believes it's the best way to save it, not necessarily only to achieve power for power's sake.  However, in doing so becomes enamored with it until that's all that matters to him, eclipsing his original good intentions.  \n\nEventually, this pursuit of power will go so far as to ironically bring down the community it was supposed to benefit.  In this specific case, that hasn't been outright stated but now the Freljord's trolls have essentially surrendered their autonomy to the Ice Witch, even if they don't know it yet.  By this point, that doesn't really matter to Trundle though.  He's seen the opportunity for even more power than he originally thought, and the fact that he pledged his whole people, who he had no right to speak for (heck, at the time he didn't even have the right to speak for his *own* tribe), to Lissandra shows just how far gone he was.   \n\nThat sort of change in a character (and yes, I'm making the assertion that there was a change and he wasn't initially like this) makes for a very compelling story, not entirely unlike the original, which has been stated earlier.  He set out to save his tribe, but ended up throwing them (and in the new story, many others) under the bus.  Yes, the character's personality is significantly changed but that can be attributed to the story differences such as his reason for betraying the other trolls - spite/revenge vs. personal gain. \n\nWhile both have merits, my personal preference goes to the troll chief usurper who had the audacity to name himself king.  Gotta admire that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-09-30T17:20:16.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do agree it's a good story, I still think the character the same is one of the most important parts to keep when retconning if you care about the character in the first place.

It doesn't seem like the same character.\n\nI don't see this as a case of preferences, for this argument which one is better is irrelevant, it's a case of caring about your characters.
