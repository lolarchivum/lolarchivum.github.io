Difference is Yasuo punishes mistakes much harder then others and is rewarded way more.  Again you dance around how he up and does good damage from behind despite being behind over just one item. \n\nI wont let you drown out simple pure logic just cause I am guessing you're some hot shot diamond player cause I know other high elo players agree with me... you can drop this shame tactic already, his scaling will be proportionate with improved gameplay, its simple math.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-02-03T21:37:39.483+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the game last more then 20m He will suddenly become a monster even if the player is bad.

If riot doesn't nerf him then they've gotta be ignoring the community at this point. His q damage is so over stat with his 0 cooldowns and no energy/mana. He scales FAR too fast being strong at all stages of the game and can still beat people who are suppose to counter him. they need to give him some sorta RESOURCE BAR LIKE ALL THE OTHER CHAMPIONS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE LIMITS  then make his cooldowns longer  SO HE DOESN'T GET AWAY WITH ABILITY SPAM BEING LIMITLESS DOING 500 PER Q POKE IN LANE make his e have i dunno. A COOLDOWN LIKE OTHER MORE BALANCED CHAMPIONS and his windwall HAVE MORE COUNTER PLAY.
