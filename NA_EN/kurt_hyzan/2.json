His kit would literally be the worst in the game if he wasn't able to ward jump, can you imagine him trying to gank people? His ult would be practically useless unless he had flash up and his q would be the only ability he had that could gap close in his kit, other than that he would have 0 mobility. Jumping to allied minions wouldn't help him chase his opponent when he's ganking a lane.\nI'm not trying to be disingenuous but you're opinions are so out of place that it is concerning.\nand\n\n{{champion:68}} \n{{champion:72}} \nare fine? Rumble gets played quite a bit and while Skarner doesn't, he still is a very strong pick in the current meta. You're talking about an ult that completely negates a champion in a teamfight, even with qss the cd is low enough that you can just force another fight afterwards and take advantage of the fact that their qss is down. While he lacks gap close, that's intentional, since he has a stun and a movement speed buff in his kit. About Rumble, I'm not even sure what to say, sure you can't blind pick Rumble into anyone, but neither can almost any champ, and Rumble is very strong right now, you just need to know how to play him. Try watching twitch.tv/looter the challenger Rumble OTP. That's not to say since he's a challenger OTP that the champ is extremely strong, but if you watch how he plays you can tell that if the champ is played right he is extremely powerful. People just don't like putting in the mechanical effort required for Rumble. Although I think Skarner could use a little attention, I don't thiink he is nearly as bad as you're implying.\n\n> {{champion:157}} aka Cancerosaurus Rex\n\nReally, for who? Yasuo is a very predictable champion, his e usage is blatant and pronounced, and outside of minions, he has nearly 0 mobility. Also after busting his shield, he is extremely squishy. Sure his late game may be overtuned, but you can easily take advantage of his weak early game, to the point where his mid to late game is non-existent.\n\n> Same case with {{champion:121}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} or any \"one shot mad playz\" assassins \n\nOkay REALLY? All of these champs are terrible at the moment, why? Because tank items are so strong and lethality got nerfed hard. Sure they have alot of mobility, but playing these champs places you AND your team at a disadvantage since they; 1. Don't offer any form of cc 2. Don't do nearly enough damage to compensate for their terrible late game (excluding zed.) 3. Khazix and Zed lose early game hard, but are put at an extreme disadvantage in the late game sense with items and abilities, assassinating is extremely hard.\n\nI agree that it seems like only popular champs get to see specific changes, particularly in instances where challenger players pointed out specific bugs or flaws that had existed for very long periods of time and then suddenly the next patch they are fixed. But most of what you said here is so out of touch with the game that it actually hurts me to read what you're typing. Note that I don't even play any of these champs (except for lee sin) so it's not even a perspective bias.\nLevel 27 is a little too early to start trying to analyze what is strong and what is not, you won't be able to tell how strong or weak something is until you've seen someone play that champ at a high level of play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kurt Hyzan","date":"2018-06-29T21:58:16.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are we playing the same game ?

Riven is not balanced around the \"hardcore mains\" many of her recent changes were made to allow her advanced combos to be used at a lower level, such as the balancing towards making some of her combos easier (have more time to perform them) and making her animation cancelling easier (once again having more time to perform them). While hardcore Riven players still utilize these changes, the changes weren't meant for them. Also Riven is usually a pretty popular champ which in my opinion is why there has been so many \"quality of life changes\"centred around her recently. Such as the recent, ever so slight early game buffs for her.\n\n> Yas is currently in the trashcan\n\nNot true, trashcan is a very strong word to describe his state. I think his early game needs buffed and his late game nerfed, while he is somewhat weak I wouldn't go as far as to say he's a trashcan, since most Yasuo mains at a high enough level perform at least average even in games they feed. (early)\n\n> Riot doesn't balance around popularity\n\n\nA claim with nothing to back it up, while I disagree with this statement if you provided a piece of evidence, I might be willing to agree.\n\n\n> If people like a champion they will play them regardless of how strong or weak they are.\n\nThis doesn't really belong here, people play every champion, even the champions with low playrates have player that main them, that doesn't mean that that specific champ gets alot of attention. Just because out of millions of players a small percentage will play a champion no matter how strong or weak they are, doesn't mean that riot gives these players alot of attention.

Fact of the matter is few people other than hardcore mains play her regularly, and riot even said they pretty much balance riven around those players recently.\n\nYas is in the trashcan. He was so far in the trashcan he warranted his own hotfix because of how much the crit changes dumpstered him. Trashcan is the only real word for it.\n\nTheres no logic behind riot balancing around popularity. The only thing popularity gives us is more data to work with. Thats it. Riot doesnt favorite a champion because players prefer them, riot mostly just pushes the game to whatever meta they currently want to keep things fresh while keeping all picks generally viable unless the kit is deemed too toxic (and even then we no longer see eve tier nerfs)\n\nYes, that belongs there. Riot stated themselves that they found power does not significantly affect play rate. The things that affect playrate most is if people resonate with the champions theme and kit more than anything.","replies":[{"poster":"RxO Carmada","date":"2018-06-29T18:59:59.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you did here is restate your first post. Riven has been consistently one of the most played top laners with some of the most recent patches being an exception. If as you say her only players are the 'hardcore' players than, there are enough hardcore riven players to double or triple the amount of play rate many other champions get.\n\nYas isn't bad, only if youre bad with him, maybe you aren't playing at a high enough elo where people actually abuse him. Just because he isn't picked often doesn't mean he is a \"trashcan\" champ.\n\nThere is no logic around riot not balancing around popularity. Also there is consistent evidence that they do balance around popularity such as the recent \"hashinshin\" patch.
