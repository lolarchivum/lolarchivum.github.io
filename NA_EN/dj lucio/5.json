He requires perfect positioning and has no mobility (except a speed buff when he dies) or hard cc. In fights he is extremely easy to focus down if he even slightly steps out of line and laning with him is hell if you fall behind especially due to how easy you are to gank. \n\nHis rewards are very clear position well and if you do proceed to see you did well over 90k damage that game and kill people as they're running at you. His only spellls you really notice an impact on are W and E as AD kogmaw as E slows and W gives more damage and range Q is only ranked for it's %ATK speed growth and if that wasn't there wouldn't be touched until level 12ish as there is not much use of it early game. Ultimate can cost a lot of mana if spammed however needs to be used to pick off stragglers or check bushes as it grants vision. \n\nADC reccomendations are a bit hard for me as I only know how to play Kog'Maw Draven and Kalista as an ADC however for a beginner I would reccomend\n{{champion:51}}  - Traps for CC, long range, and an escape. Pretty safe and strong champion at the moment.\n{{champion:222}}  - A hypercarry with a global execute and two forms of CC being a stun?(it may be a snare I'm not to sure) and a rather strong slow. A global execute can easily help out teams and Kill Secure yourself into an adcantage\n{{champion:81}} - While he is a unique ADC in he doesn't Auto as much but he does have CC ONLY after getting Iceborn Gauntlet making him slow more than a Karthus with Rylias, A second flash, and another global spell. \n{{champion:202}} - Unique mechanic on an ADC who can pump out loads of damage. He possesses invisible traps which slow, a long range root, a long range ult which can easily execute enemies, and movespeed on crits. While I don't think he is to great for a beginning ADC player learning him will be beneficial to your ADC roster.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-01-11T15:52:48.797+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Not building {{item:3078}} on {{champion:41}} is the fucking worst.\nNot using Keg combos is bad.\nNot using mastery 7 emote is worse.\nBut not building Trinity Force is realistically the worst thing you can do on GP","replies":[{"poster":"Dabrick01","date":"2017-01-11T15:55:38.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I fucking suck at GP but when I get that 2000 crit barrel in the teamfight, shit goes down.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-01-11T15:59:41.405+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"1200 is a more realistic number these days, but yes.\nBig Crits are likely to deal big damage :^)\n\nAlso, what are these downvotes to litterally every comment? lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2017-01-11T15:58:20.476+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:23}}  running warlord's\n\nI don't even care about the build","replies":[]},{"poster":"Busty Demoness","date":"2017-01-11T21:13:35.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:21}} running DFT.\n\nThere's one reason to run it on her, and that's to cheese the enemy with Q bounces.
