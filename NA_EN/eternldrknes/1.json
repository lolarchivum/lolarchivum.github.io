I could be queuing, reading patch notes, or haven't even logged in yet, but I will get the \"Trying to Reconnect\" screen that will pop up and prevent me from doing anything for 5, 10, or 30+ minutes before it finally goes away. Thinking it was on my end due to a hard drive failure a couple days ago, I went and had a clean install done on a new one. Upon getting everything set up, I load up league only to find that message taunt me every now and again. It's preventing me from playing ranked games since I've already been bugsplatted previously and couldn't connect back in.\r\nAfter a bunch of attempted troubleshooting on the old hard drive, I think it must be on Riot's end since there really is nothing on this drive. It all started with patch 7.1 being released and is honestly causing quite a headache. I haven't seen any other issues similar to mine but I still attempted all their troubleshooting outlets, despite the fact that I'm running on the fresh install. Curious to see if Riot is aware of such an issue related to patch 7.1.\r\nAgain this problem happens randomly and I have noticed absolutely no patterns associated with it. My internet is fine as I have monitored that as I am able to load up other applications with no issue.

Wouldn't go past that no matter how many times I hit retry. And the client beta will not let me past the login screen due to the trying to reconnect. I've went through the entire troubleshooting guide to no avail. Ran the hextech tool to gain some logs and submitted a ticket. Maybe someone can find something in there. Not sure why this all of a sudden happens coincidentally after a large patch. Nothing was abnormal in any of the tests and again nothing has changed over the past years on my end either. Still a hit and miss in the client beta too, I just can't seem to load the legacy client anymore without an \"unspecified error.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sentient Salad","date":"2017-02-02T06:53:27.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. Exact same issue. Beta client completely ruined in regards to \"connection issues\". Uninstalled and went for the legacy client only to get the \"unspecified error\" when trying to install. I uninstalled, reinstalled, uninstalled... On my 3rd round trying to get the legacy client to work, I got the unspecified error message at 99% completion. Instead of clicking the \"retry\" option the error box offers, I hit the exit symbol. \n\nLong story short, my league slowly but surely then continued to patch from 99% to launch.  I managed to get past the legacy client issue by exiting the error message, instead of clicking the \"retry\" option. \n\nI thought I'd fixed this whole situation only to have an in game \"attempting to reconnect\"  and time outs occur during a ranked game today. My internet is fine with good ping atm actually. I tried turning  - anti virus on gaming/ safe mode. Everything is normal on my end, and the only thing that was new was the Ocean week patch - which is when all my issues began.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T21:04:17.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying all of that!

I have seen you replying to other person's problems to help them. Thanks for being cool. And I think it's not possible to fix the \"Reconnecting To Cilent\" issue. Unless you pay for a faster wifi. All I can think of it to put the cilent's priority to above normal or high (If you have at least 3 gigabytes of ram free to be used). That way your pc will focus more power to the cilent making it less lagger and can quickly reconnect to the cilent. I'm sorry if this information is wrong. But I hope it may help you guys.

However, there are a lot of ports that needs to be opened for the client to work properly, so the easy solution is to set up your PC as a DMZ on the router.\nA DMZ means that the computer will not be protected by the firewalls of the router, which puts your computer at risk, so keep that in mind. \n\nFirst, you need to know what is the IP address of your computer. You can find out by opening CMD and typing \"ifconfig\". It will show you something like \"192.168.8.15\". That is your computer's IP inside your home network. Do not go to google and type \"what is my ip\" because that will give you the external IP of your home, and not the internal IP of your computer inside your home network. \n\nAfter getting your computer's IP, go into your router's settings and find a setting named DMZ or DMZ server, and put your computer's IP there. \nENJOY. \n\nP.S.\nEvery time you restart your router, your computer gets a different IP address, so you can either set a static IP address to your computer via the network settings in the computer itself, or via DHCP reservation in your router.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cariboulouCx","date":"2017-09-16T04:42:12.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem too and I've tried everything from multiple different forum threads of possible fixes, still having massive lag spikes then reconnecting midgame, impossible to do well ingame with a unresponsive game...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luke2510","date":"2017-08-25T19:57:33.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having this problem too, anyone have a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"H4ntu Raya","date":"2017-08-28T16:18:25.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luke2510,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=hP9PPaMa,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-08-25T19:57:33.709+0000)\n>\n> Having this problem too, anyone have a fix?\n\nI also have this problem but there doesn't seem to be a fix.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForestBeast4","date":"2017-06-29T08:27:05.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here it is 29/6/2017 and today i was playing janna.
