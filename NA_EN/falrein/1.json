He just plays one on Piltover TV. His real name is \"David Steel\", Piltover's most popular celebrity known for his \"true to life\" acting method.\n\n- {{champion:150}}  can speak normal, he invented the language in fact. he chooses not to cause he is really a brilliant tactician and wants everyone to think he's incompetent until he's ready to make his move.\n\n- {{champion:432}} his portals are REALLY one way. When someone hops into his portal, they are being transported to another dimension for good. the person who comes out the other side is them from another dimension that had ALSO used a portal at that exact same moment.\n\n- {{champion:142}} Her hair is a wig. a magic wig made in Ionia where she is known by her real name, \"Natasha the Kid\". famous for her notorious string of robberies across Ionia's magical banks.\n\n- {{champion:6}} He really just wanted to be a dancer, but his dad told him he had to go to executioner school. He got spider legs in order to go tell his dad \"oh no, they gave me spider legs. Now I HAVE to become a dancer. I got too many legs to be an executioner.\"\n\n- {{champion:79}} He's not really overweight, that's just a suit made to help keep him warm in the Freljord. He's really a fit strong man rivaling Braum.\n\n- {{champion:164}} Her legs are not swords, those are just really fancy shoes. All the rage in Piltover. Same for the grappling hooks on her hips. Only thing truly modified on her is her hair, which is so sharp it could cut through solid steel.\n\n- {{champion:266}} Came up with the double A thing just to tease Varus. Varus is not amused. Rhaast is VERY amused\n\n- {{champion:3}} He doesn't really need magic to function, it's just that no one ever thought to give the giant statue a cup of coffee to wake him up in the morning.\n\n- {{champion:41}} He really hates Oranges. But he will put up with them because they have strange healing properties on him and allow him to make exploding barrels appear out of nowhere. like a super power you can only use by eating your least favorite food, it is a blessing and a curse.\n\n- {{champion:21}} LOVES oranges. so much so she has a Yandere relationship with oranges. GP is her enemy not because he killed her family, that is just what she tells people to hide the truth. She just wants all the oranges to herself and will stop at nothing to make them hers.\n\n-  {{champion:518}} Neeko isn't really Neeko. Neeko is really J4 who is really Leblanc who is really Leblanc's clone who is REALLY Neeko's clone who is really pretending to be cho'gath who got polymorphed into leblanc's clone\n\n-  {{champion:517}} Is really J4's secret brother. Separated at birth, neither one has any memory of each other.\n\n- {{champion:39}} Is not really Irelia. It's Warring Kingdoms Kat who hit her head and lost her memory. She made up an entire story of who she is that was SO believable even she thinks it's true. How does she make her blades levitate then? She always had that power, she just never knew until she lost her memory.\n\n- {{champion:427}} Sometimes watches as animals kill unsuspecting travelers and yearns for the days where he was known as \"Ivern the Cruel\". Though he very well understands that his situation will likely get worse if he goes back to his old ways.\n\n- {{champion:50}} was on the cover of \"foxy grandpa monthly\".\n\n- {{champion:58}} is really an Alligator. He just doesn't want to be a bother by correcting anyone.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2019-04-01T10:39:45.544+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze is actually just a homeless bald man suffering from iron poisoning.
