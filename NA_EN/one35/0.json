But here's the gist of it.\n\n- His gameplay is just so _dumb_. What Riot member looked at the cancer proxyfarming gameplay that someone came up with and thought that they shouldn't try to fix it?  When he proxyfarms it's so annoying because you can't do anything about it because you'll just waste your time when he runs into tower and now he has a CS lead, so you just have to let it happen.\n\n- He's so ugly. Just look at his design, look at his skins, look at his abilities... what about it looks appealing in any way? I can't handle looking a his splash art on any of his skins and he completely ruins the SSW skin line for me.\n\n- WHY DOES HE HAVE A FLIP? I'm going to preface this with saying that I don't read lores, so this is probably something in Singed's lore or... something. But why an old man who is also a chemist can flip a mountain is a bit questionable to me. I can kinda see Volibear and Urgot having it because they are both almost images of 'strength' in a way so that makes sense.
