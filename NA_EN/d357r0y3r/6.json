She wasn't fun in any sense of the word, she was niche and she still had the big strength of taking only 1-3 seconds in dropping her targets if they had no hard CC to stop her.\n\nBut i agree that the current Kayle also has a big drawback of needing too long to come online (level 11+).\nWithout her range, she has retained her major weakness and can't even remain long in a fight to fight back besides using her abilities, not ranged attacks. Riot should definitely leave short windows of her melee form like she previously had and smooth out her power curve. I also don't think it's pretty fun just getting all the passive bonuses from her kit + items and auto-ing people to death in 1-3 seconds flat in the late game.\n\nI'm fine with her ultimate.\nI don't think that her invulnerability spell that can could've only be stopped by hard CC (previously) without disabling her AAs, had any merit in being her \"i cannot lose\" button. I think this iteration (with an actual AP ratio), is way better than her pure utility one before.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-06-26T17:31:38.121+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Kayle's \"unique\" laning was never unique at all.\nYou already have Nidalee, Elise, Jayce and Gnar who can change between melee/range forms.

Her melee form did not get any benefits which meant you still had to not engage or even get close to minions if the enemy could have easily retaliated.\n\nNidalee and Elise don't lane, so the comparison is stupid. They're also mages, which play completely differently from Kayle's auto attack heavy style. Jayce can choose between being ranged and melee rather than being ranged for a duration. Jayce is also an ad caster (basically a mage), which plays completely differently from Kayle. Gnar is permanently ranged with his passive transforming him into a melee champion, with more CC and health. Again, Gnar plays completely differently than Kayle. Her melee 'form' isn't supposed to have benefits. It's a drawback.\n\n> That being said, Riot could buff Kayle in terms of specific target healing.\nThe one who she target heals gets the full benefit of her previous healing value while the secondary target gets this heal value, since the ability's flat CD and mana cost per level remained the same. This preserves her solo lane sustain while also buffing her supporting capability (i actually on occasion do play support Kayle).\n\nKayle hasn't been viable support in over 6 seasons. Her heal shouldn't have a second target because that basically removes the choice aspect between healing yourself or others. You'd always get both.\n\n> Old Kayle also had a degenerating playstyle.\nYou only needed to hit level 6 + Guinsoo's + Lethal Tempo to get yourself going on a warpath.\nOld Kayle had her charms and for being unchanged for a long period of years, people have simply gotten used to her bad kit and played around it. She wasn't fun in any sense of the word, she was niche and she still had the big strength of taking only 1-3 seconds in dropping her targets if they had no hard CC to stop her.\n\nKayle would need to buy Berserker boots and Nashor's before getting Rageblade, which is 4200 gold on top of Rageblade's cost. She'd be well past level 6 at that point. Most Kayles did not take Lethal Tempo. This isn't even broken levels of power either, plus trying to argue if it did or not would ignore the fact **laning phase does in fact exist.** Kayle is best at 4 items, not 2.\n\nYou also didn't really explain how her playstyle was degenerate. You stated your opinions that she had a bad kit, wasn't fun, was niche. The only thing you said was that she can melt targets if no one CCs her, which is a statement that applies to every ranged auto attacker.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IainG10","date":"2019-06-26T02:28:11.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget they changed the way her Ranged-Mode works so that Yas's Windwall can stop it.\n\nOld Kayle used to be my go-to Yas killer....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bronze smurf69","date":"2019-06-26T09:57:28.315+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"A fuckin cockroach can design better champions than those clueless idiots.\n\nWhen there is no Rioter with the balls to say \"No that's a bad idea don't add it\" (hint hint, morello) with no concern of breaking their feelings, then these champions wouldn't be much fair and simply be toxic.\n\nBut apparently saying \"no\" to a designer is against the rules at riot games.\n\nRiot's golden rule: everybody is a sensitive wimp, so critics aren't allowed!","replies":[{"poster":"Glaricion","date":"2019-06-26T10:08:03.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm really worried about Morello's project.\nCertainlyT is a great singe player champion designer who is a scourge to us because he's working on a multiplayer game.\nWhat if Morello turns out to be the opposite?\n\n(assuming he is working on a singleplayer game, not entrusting my time to Riot for another multiplayer experience after the XXXXshow that's modern League)","replies":[{"poster":"bronze smurf69","date":"2019-06-26T10:53:19.225+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glaricion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nVUz9W3u,comment-id=00170000,timestamp=2019-06-26T10:08:03.252+0000)\n>\n> I'm really worried about Morello's project.\n> CertainlyT is a great singe player champion designer who is a scourge to us because he's working on a multiplayer game.\n> What if Morello turns out to be the opposite?\n> \n> (assuming he is working on a singleplayer game, not entrusting my time to Riot for another multiplayer experience after the XXXXshow that's modern League)\n\nMany agree that CT is great for a single game, but honestly I don't give a shit.
