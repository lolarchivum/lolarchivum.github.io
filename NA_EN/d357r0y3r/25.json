Currently junglers are at their strongest at lvls 2-3, and after that they're getting gradually weaker than other lanes (unless they're snowballing). Removal of said spike might end in junglers changing again into utility bots, which no one really wants to play.\n\n\nI won't talk about the damage problem of the game, but ADCs cannot be given agency if they aren't going to be reworked to be more than \"Ranged autoattack damage\".
