But, I&#039;ve been playing since season three and I&#039;ve put together enough thoughts on balance and the current state to make a substantial post(s) out of it\n* I will partially be looking at aggregate trends I have seen on the boards for a long time. For example, Lee Sin was strong and probably needed nerfs and the boards called for nerfs like crazy; now he&rsquo;s fine and no one even mentions him. That&rsquo;s the type of thing I will try to ignore.\n* I am Gold V. If that makes you think my opinion on balance is invalid, then good, you&rsquo;re probably not the type of person I wanted to have a discussion with anyway. But that&rsquo;s not to say rank is unimportant and not something be taken into consideration. Personally, I think I do a good job of separating problems at/with my rank and ELO from my thoughts on the game. For example, Master Yi wrecks lower ELOs and while I personally don&rsquo;t like facing him (mostly because the team effort to shut him down and keep him down is difficult at lower ELO), I have no problem with him as a whole.\n\nNow let&#039;s talk about some champions. I know I just said I would avoid hot-button topics, but these are things that have been bothering me. And hey, try to get them free upvotes\n\n#Yasuo, Zoe, and CertainlyT:\n\n##Yasuo:\n\nYasuo as a whole I&rsquo;m generally ok with. I despise playing against him, but again, personal issues, not overarching issues. The biggest overarching issue I have with him is his windwall. Basically, assuming the Yasuo isn&rsquo;t braindead stupid, he will always windwall the right thing. It&rsquo;s a terrible feeling to pick, say, Ashe and feel that 25-50% of my reason for picking her is negated with negligible ways of countering on my part. Now the obvious answer is poke, but again, unless the Yasuo&rsquo;s braindead or it&rsquo;s just THAT MUCH POKE (doable, but a completely separate scenario that would need special consideration), he won&rsquo;t waste his windwall on it. And that&rsquo;s the problem. People say he&rsquo;s unfun to play against because beating him feels more like him outplaying himself than you outplaying him. This is, in my opinion, is the key aspect of that. In terms of how to correct this, I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;ve seen it suggested that Riot make his windwall cost flow (the thing that powers is passive shield), but that would too much counterplay with how easy it currently is to remove.\nHe could also afford to lose the armor pen on his ult. Make him buy armor pen like the rest if he wants to shred tanks. Barring that (something something melee AD carries all get steroids), the duration could be a lot lower. Another part of the problem is that if he gets into a fight and you come in later to help, he still has it. Not finishing a fight with the armor pen advantage and having landed his ult should warrant some penalty.\n\n##Zoe:\nCool design, fun champ, will be playing.\nBut there are a lot of problems, many that people have already mentioned. Going through:\n\n* Q does too much damage\n * Yeah, probably. I would highly suggest spreading the damage out to her W and passive damage. It would reduce the ridiculousness with her E because now no single damage source reaches that high, the &ldquo;no-wave clear&rdquo; disadvantage would actually be a disadvantage and getting the ridiculous damage off would require her to stay in the fight where I can capitalize on her squishiness. Her W should mean said capitalization is still not an outright given.\n* W too RNG, especially in Lane\n * Definitely an issue. Honestly, they could just make summoners not drop from minions and it would probably, maybe be ok. Though with some of the other changes, it may be a little much.\n* E has too much\n * Definitely an issue. The extra damage, the Cooldown reduction (now removed unless a direct hit), and the raw CC (that doesn&rsquo;t work as consistently with spell shield/CC removal).  The CD reduction nerf was a good call; make it work fully consistently with spell shields and CC removal and it&rsquo;s good\n * THE GODDAMN TRAP. This is a slight personal issue, but the trap part gives it slightly more range, so even if you dodge it, you didn&rsquo;t. Add a slight arm time (which is there, but maybe a bit longer?) because that is one of the most infuriating things currently in the game.\n* R&rsquo;s cool. Good synergy and design with Q; clear counterplay because you know where she&rsquo;ll land\n* Also, having played her some now, where the hell are her mana costs? I was playing her in Poro King (not Summoner&rsquo;s Rift quite yet). I started NLR one game and I still felt I had more than enough mana to spam everything. The only mana item I built that game was Sheen/Lichbane\n\n##CertainlyT:\n\nIn terms of raw design, he does good work. But he doesn&rsquo;t do counterplay very well. And not the &ldquo;there is something I can do to counter&rdquo; counterplay but the &ldquo;it feels good to do the thing that counters them&rdquo; counterplay (I&rsquo;ll probably talk more about this in a later post). See windwall for a good example.\nHe also doesn&rsquo;t really seem to have a good idea of when to stop adding things to champions. More damage, more mobility, and wouldn&rsquo;t it great if this synergized with that, and maybe we can add in some CDR? Or at least that&rsquo;s what it feels like. A champ that does too much for other champions to keep up.\nLook at Warwick. If I recall correctly, he felt ill at ease having to work within the confines of a pre-set champion. Within these bounds, he created what many consider his most balanced and healthy champion yet. It&rsquo;s interesting, if nothing else.\n\n\n \n#Fiora:\nI will go on record as saying Fiora is one if not the only full rework that I think was a complete and utter failure. Let me take about a minute to explain why.\n1. To make vitals feel vital they have to do a lot when hit.\n2. To make the player feel like a master duelist, vitals have to be relatively easy to hit.\n3. Relatively Easy to hit + does a lot = inherently broken.\n\nAlso, why does her ult have a heal? Her ult also sucks because vitals suck. And it&rsquo;s a good idea of what I was talking about before with the different types of counterplay. Standing against a wall to not have a vital procced is a counter, but in terms gameplay and how it feels to play against Fiora, it feels like shit.\nIf they don&rsquo;t want to scrap everything (and I do like the rest of her abilities), I would suggest making vitals only appear after being in combat. And it makes sense from a real world perspective*. Even experienced duelists and fighters cannot strike a weak point against a trained opponent right off the bat. It takes setup and catching the opponent at the right moment.\n\n######*Add talking about how reality, lore, and gameplay interact to the list of future topics.\n\nI still say her ult is stupid and needs to be deleted\nIf it is determined she needs a full rework (unlikely, but eh), I would suggest looking at Weiss from RWBY and how she uses her sigils. I still remember her fight with the White Fang lieutenant, seeing her finishing move and thinking after &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Fiora&rsquo;s [old] ultimate.&rdquo;\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NrMmdkd.jpg[/img]\n\n#Fizz:\nHAH! YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BITCH ABOUT THE FISH BUT NO. THIS ISN&rsquo;T JUST MEME BAIT CIRCLEJERKING.\nFizz is pretty alright in my book. IDC if he&rsquo;s even still on the boards circlejerk hate train. He was and is generally an easy target for them and something usually pops up every once in a while.\n\n#Kayle:\nFuck this champion; she needs to be reworked ASAP and disabled until reworked.\nNo, but seriously, if you will allow me a bit of salt, Kayle basically either does\n1. Everything you do but better\n2. Cockblocks everything you were trying to do\n3. Sometimes both\n\n*Fuck Kayle, ~~bush league super food~~*\nEDIT: I must amend. I said I would avoid personal issues, which Kayle most definitely is. I just really, really hate Kayle.\nShe does need  rework though.\n\n\n#Minor suggestions for:\n\n##Zed:\nI would suggest making it so he cannot jump back to his ult shadow unless he has killed me or the pop will kill me. If he wants to fight me, then let&rsquo;s fight, none of this pansy ass ulting to poke and force me out of lane nonsense.\n\n##Ekko:\nI would remove the heal from his ult. IDK, I just think it would smooth out his play pattern by effectively killing tanko. And it would play into the delayed burst thing Rito&rsquo;s been going for.\nCombo--&gt; Back out--&gt; Ult-&gt; Combo.

Additionally if the enemy champ is facing in the same direction Fiora doesn't heal from attacking the Vital and the champ is only dealt 1.5% of their Max HP in dmg. (Both might b 2 much tho). But that would provide some skillful counterplay.\nAdditionally They could reduce the size of the of Vitals and increase their number 2 six.\n\nHonesty i could see a master duelist picking out weakspots in an oppenent's defense at a distance, sure they can't hit the weakspot until they are in range, but I think that they could guess at where the opponent is weak.\n\nThey explained that her ult didn't feel rewarding enough and it also put her in a lot of danger having to tunnel vision in on one champ like that, so they needed to balance out the risk, and help give more reward for the risk\n\nSure Weiss' fight might have reminded you of Fiora's old ult, but how would that be any fun/fair to play against what the counter play in gettting a bunch or randome free dashes. Thats what the old ult was, it was a bug part of the reason why they reworked her it wasnt healthy. Lets say for health's sake that the Ult drastically reduced the CD of Fiora's dash IF she hit a Vital or something like that, in that case Fiora would never NOT hit a vital. People already complain about the short CD of her Q anyways.\n\nThe current rendition of her ult except for maybe the teamwide heal and additional MS is actually better than the old one, and is the best way for Fiora players to show the mastery.

It&#x27;s a difficult balance.\n\nit may be tru that reducing healing or dmg done is a nerf, but when u add in the condition that the enemy MUST be facing the Vital when hit it does 3 things that I think outweighs the cons of the nerfs to Fiora.\n1.) provides meaningful counterplay with skill display that could be satifying for Fiora's opponent while still allowing her to get something out of the risk (2 of the following: tru % HP dmg, bonus MS, heal)\n2.) it forces Fiora's opponent to be facing in the direction of the Vital which means that they can't do some actions that they nomally would: Fiora can kinda benefit from that, hopefully this is helpful give and take\n3.) the fight become more life-like like \"For Honor\" the enemy is attempting to block in the direction that Fiora is attacking and will make Fiora players more skilled.\nThe vital is no less vital it just gives her a bit less of the enemy is smart enough to block it, but again in that moment their CS'ing is hindered, any abilities that face the same direction they do is hindered, and their movement is hindered...So Fiora still gets something out it even if what she is getting out it is subtle.\n\n> And a master duelist may see all the weakpoints, hitting them is different matter. Further, she&#x27;s fighting skilled opponents. While not as trained, they are also likely aware of their weakpoints.\n\nnot all her opponents are skilled in melee combat tho, i think this is something you should just let Riot get away with, unless u have a better idea. If u are not able to come up with a better solution then pointing it out only does, half the work but doesn't do much to solve it. Hitting them is what they player has control of to prove their mastery. Additionally being aware on their weakpoints is what the visbility of the Vitals to the enemies provides. They can see the side they are weak on and should be able to act to protect it, which is another reason why facing the vital should provide some sort of way for them to block Fiora.\n\n> I was talking about how they could incorporate Weiss&#x27;s sigils and how she uses them for movement.

Perhaps using Q leaves a mark she can dash back to at the start of the dash and W leaves a mark she can dash to at the end of it range. Perhaps she marks all units surrounding the initial target and she can dash to marked targets as long as the dash takes her through the initial target. But giving a champ the ability to dash multiple times in quick succession makes them very hard to deal with, even if you know where they are gonna go, there are a lot of ways that it can be used to their advantage and people do NOT like that, its fun for you, not fun for them.

Plus, realizing there&#x27;s a problem is the first step to correcting it.\n\nSo u want the passive to only activate after being in combat? Perhaps a few sec after imitating combat? I could definitly see that happening. But what happens when the vital appears right between Fiora and the opponent where Fiora can hit it easily while in combat. A situation like this is probably why they have the vital set up immediately on the 1st enemy champ within a certain range, so they plan around it.\n\n> Third Point\n> I&#x27;m fine with Fiora using magic.

I think they could be implemented in a fair and balanced way, but without seeing a set plan, I can&#x27;t really say\n\nThe \"sigils\" if u wanna call them that don't even have to be magic, they can simply be ground targeted indicators showing where she will dash. But let me ask you this: while it does look cool how does getting a bunch of dashes give a good display of skill? If a Fiora player set up a whole bunch of dash locations around me and it didn't require an exorbitant amount of work or time on her part, I wouldn't think, it was because of skill I would think it was OP, in most cases the target is dead b4 they can do anything. I think her ult is fine, except I would get rid of the heal and increase the vitals to 6 or 8 (reducing the MS, dmg, and heals accordingly). I'd feel outplayed and that the Fiora player displayed skill taking me out using all of her abilities to hit all the vitals, not if she got a bunch of dashes.

I like how you preempted the idiots who say \"lul low rank scrub don't know shit\" because those people are assholes and you deserve to be heard. Their opinion of your opinion is invalid. And I really appreciated how you dealt with that.\n\nAnd seriously, you should re-post each of the following discussion points in it's own separate post so that they have the opportunity to succeed each on their own rather than risk any of them getting dragged down with downvotes from circle-jerks that disagree with you.\n\n---\n\n**Yasuo:** \n\nI think you hit the nail on the head about how it feels more like the Yasuo outplaying himself when you manage to beat him. Good analysis of his abilities, and I appreciate that you didn't just say, \"my idea is the best Riot should do it and don't question me.\" Like some people do when they have rework ideas. You proposed these ideas thoughtfully, and in suggestion-form instead of demand-form.\n\n---\n\n**Zoe:** \n\nVery good ideas for rebalancing her. I especially like how you suggested \"shifting her damage out of Q and into other parts of her kit\" rather than just insisting that she needed a straight up nerf. This is good analysis, and it encourages thoughtful discussion instead of the usual pissing matches that people like to start over the balance of newly-released champions.\n\n---\n\n**CertainlyT:** \n\nProps for not just circle-jerking over him. A lot of people like to demand he should be fired, which is unhelpful and not-constructive. You did far better than them in this regard. You analyzed his strengths and weaknesses as a designer and I desperately hope that he gets to see your analysis, because I feel that it is the most unbiased and polite critiques of his work that I've seen in a long time.\n\n---\n\n**Fiora:** \n\nIMO your analysis is spot on. She's in this weird spot where the mechanics of her kit have to be OP in order to feel good to use. I like how you compared her to Weiss from RWBY, and I agree that her ultimate should be changed. I especially like the change you suggested for vitals where she is forced to be in combat with them before they appear. This does make thematic sense, and it would certainly help to make her play patterns in lane less about zoning and poking and more about actual dueling.\n\nHere's my own idea to add to the Fiora thing. Maybe they could rework her ultimate into something like Weiss's sigil ability. Perhaps Fiora could 'challenge' her target to a duel, creating a ring (probably roughly the size of her current ultimate around her target). While it is active she gets boosts to things like movement speed or maybe reduced cooldowns on her abilities (W would have to not be able to stun enemies during this because that would be OP) and make it so that if she is standing close to the edge of the circle her Q lunge gains increased range. This would allow her to move around her opponent while lunging from longer distances, really amping up the idea of dueling, lunging at her opponent and parrying against attacks more often.\n\nIt's still just a rough idea, but what do you think?\n\n---\n\n**Fizz:** \n\nNo comment. I haven't played as or against him in too long so I don't have anything to base my opinions of him off of.\n\n**Kayle:** \n\nI like how you recognized your own bias here, it was professional of you and gives your post a better appearance of self-awareness. By expressing extreme opinions but still recognizing that they are extreme and probably incorrect, it gives more weight and respectability to the rest of your points.\n\n**Zed:** \n\nInteresting idea. In theory I like it. I do think it would help to encourage Zed to be more interactive with his play patterns, and more kill focused instead of trying to poke people out of lane.\n\n**Ekko:** \n\nInteresting idea, I don't agree with it but I don't think it is especially bad either. At this time I have nothing of value to add to the discussion about Ekko.","replies":[{"poster":"zero356","date":"2017-12-18T18:51:41.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy wall of text batman, but thank you\n\nAnd what you described for Fiora's ult is basically Camille's ult.

If they wanted to take a sigil/Weiss route, it would need to be integrated into her entire kit.\n\nRight, that's exactly what I'm thinking. It wouldn't be an arena that the enemy couldn't leave (instead it should move with the enemy), and it would interact with Fiora's kit. Imagine if Fiora had most of her kit enhanced by the ultimate. Her Q could have it's cooldown reduced or reset whenever she reached the edge of the circle (available on an internal cooldown) or when she successfully parries something. Maybe her Q would have an increased range during the ultimate so that she could dash around like Weiss does. And her W would have a shorter cooldown for parrying things, but maybe the cc component would be removed after the first cast so that it wouldn't be OP by allowing her to stun people back every time she blocks cc.\n\nAll of this combined might be too OP. So I'm not going to claim it should all be implemented. I'm mostly just proposing as many ideas as I can to try to bring them into discussion and get the best of them identified and picked out.\n\n> And I might break them up later.

Her design is intimate with a lot of leagues skill expression, and she has a lot of weaknesses given the dimensionality of the abilities in her kit. However, Her kit functions together well like a modern kit with the drawbacks of older kit design. She's an AP ADC, which naturally causes conflict just from the sheer fact that she exists.  \n\nKayle could use some more micro and more integral moments of power, instead of just loading on hidden power. I don't think she needs a major rework, just ability interaction changes and reordering of principles. She's a champion based on a few things:\n\n1.) Movement. She's a MS based champion, and typically goes in and out of fights. I loved this play style for her, rather than a tryndamere or ADC-esque style. She naturally seems to go in -> Reposition with W / SRS -> Kite back -> Enter the fray again.\n\n2.) Sustain Combat Amplification. She is a champion that loads up on 5 stack passives. Holy Fervor, Wits end, Cleaver, Rageblade... She makes great use of on-hit effects and the way that they stack is a key part about knowing how to fight with her. \n\nI think that a rework for Kayle, would mostly happen in her Passive, Q, and W and deal with #1 and #2 above. She's a champion that excels based on movement and positioning, while micromanaging 2.5 attack speed and trying to live with an ever push on her E.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2017-12-18T04:51:56.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wrong.\n\nKayle, just like Nasus and old Sion is a ball of stats, a stat-check champ.
