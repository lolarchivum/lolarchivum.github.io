But one of the best ways I've found to improve is not only to watch pros replays and streams, for instance if your mid maybe watch bjergsen play. After a while you start to understand everything he does, there should never be a moment where your like that makes no sense why would he do that after a while. But applying it to games can be tough. Once your so used to critiquing others gameplay, i suggest recording your own gameplay and watching it after the fact, makes it much easier to find your mistakes so you can fix them","replies":[{"poster":"Peace Is Life","date":"2016-04-27T01:12:20.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I know what you mean but my main problem is harrasing when I'm farming I can't do this!\nAnd also my positionning is I think a little bit not awesome..... ;D","replies":[{"poster":"MotrColt","date":"2016-04-27T01:59:55.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, watching film on yourself playing after watching pro players is on of the best ways to improve.

And, to be perfectly honest, you (and I mean you specifically given the stats I'm seeing) will never accomplish this from mid lane. You simply lack the appropriate skills. An average diamond 5 player manages double your cs per minute (a good indicator of top notch mechanical ability, in order to farm well you need to master last hit mechanics, wave clear mechanics, lane trade mechanics, backing and timing mechanics as it relates to the flow of objective pressure and control, and specific matchup mechanics.) That's 12 months worth of hard work and improvement ahead of you to get to that level that you simply can't compress into a 3 or 4 month stretch to make a real run before seasons end. And none of this takes into account general gameplay mechanics and knowledge like teamfight coordination, objective and map control, compositional knowledge, power spike knowledge, game flow experience and knowledge, strategic knowledge, tactical knowledge, etc, etc, etc.\n\nAll this being said, don't set that kind of goal for yourself. It can only lead to frustration. Instead, look to set smaller short term goals that are achievable and look to make improvements in your overall play each and every game. Instead of setting the goal to \"try to hit diamond\" (which, again, for you will be impossible this season) try setting a goal of winning 7 of 10 ranked games this week, or managing a 7 cs per minute or better average for your next 5 games, or dying less than 5 times in your next 10 games. Smaller short term goals like this are better at improving your skills at the game because they are goals that CAN be achieved reasonably and in a short time frame while simultaneously enhancing your skills in the areas needed to reach a much loftier long term goal of achieving a ranking in the top 1% of the ranked player base. Additional information regarding tips and tricks for climbing the ladder can be found all over the board, and, as a diamond player myself for several seasons (recently quit, this is a bad game, but that's up to you to figure out on your own) plenty of the tips and tricks you might find have even been stated by me personally. A simple forum search for my name and \"PSA regarding ranked placements\" will bring up an article posted by myself in which a great deal of information can be found not only in the OP to help you reach your goals, but also in the comments as questions were asked and answered and information divulged from a reliable top 1% player source. Another great tips and tricks poster to check out would be Commando Yi, a jungler specialist.\n\nIn any case, best of luck mate, work hard and set realistic goals for yourself and you will quickly find yourself achieving the levels of success you desire.","replies":[{"poster":"Peace Is Life","date":"2016-04-29T00:02:06.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks, if I understood well I can't go on diamond league this season and i must etablish little objectives for myself in games\n\nThanks I'll try to follow your advice :)","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-04-29T00:05:57.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ViperGaming91,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tA7bfQKR,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-04-29T00:02:06.293+0000)\n>\n> Ok thanks, if I understood well I can&#x27;t go on diamond league this season and i must etablish little objectives for myself in games\n> \n> Thanks I&#x27;ll try to follow your advice :)\n\nHappy to help mate. It always makes more sense to set realistic goals for yourself. Its far less frustrating if you don't progress quickly, and its far more motivating when you do progress quickly. Just remember to keep putting in the hard work, the practice, and the effort to make small improvements every single game and you will surely find yourself where you want to be. I always recommend that players find a coach when they believe they are capable of making a diamond run for the first time and to work with that coach extensively over the course of a year. My students have all shown dramatic improvement over the course of 12 months so I know this can work for you as well. Be sure to find some one who can regularly log on at the same times you do and who understands your primary role and/or champ to a very high degree and be sure to work with them in games and practice sessions every day.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lofi n chillhop","date":"2016-04-26T21:53:12.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. always always always always always ask yourself, what YOu can do to improve. it's useful to notice what mistakes allies made, but the only reason to notice that is to make a note not to make the same mistake yourself. when you feel that an ally has dragged you down, ask yourself if there was anything you could have done to have made up for their mistake. and try it next time (or this time) and see if it works. \n\n2. learn game timing. some things tend to happen at certain times each game, and some things happen a certain delay after another certain event. for example, janglers tend to make their first gank when they reach level 3, and players like to make plays when they have their summoners available so noting the timer of their use helps outplay them.\n\n3. learn champion mechanics and roles. by role I mean, vayne is easily bullied in lane but is strong lategame, versus corki who is strong early to mid game but falls off late. by mechanics I mean, generally understanding that a missed hook has a 10 second window of weakness, and also understanding a champion's zone of threat, such as darius with a strong close zone but irrelevant far zone, verse ziggs with a strong far zone but weak close zone. understanding the abilities speed and range also helps to dodge skillshots, or to bait a skill by coming in but dodging back out just at the edge. \n\n4. learn how to have high cs count. this isn't just about getting last hits, it is also about making sure to farm waves before making plays, and farming a wave or jung camp while you're moving about the map. \n\n5. always be map-aware. think about where enemies and allies are, and try to notice where they are moving or if they are staying put. just because you can't see an enemy doesn't mean you can't keep track of their last known movement, or think about where they might have been heading to. \n\n6. don't tilt. well, ok, tilting happens. learning how to manage your own frustration is a huge factor on your ability to always perform well no matter what scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"Peace Is Life","date":"2016-04-27T01:02:07.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to follow your advices while in game, I understood pretty all your text but there's things you'll have to explain me cause you can't practice them I think.

I don't actually know precise cooldowns, and I certainly don't know them all. but I generally remember if they're short cooldowns or long ones, like for example I know that blit's power fist is pretty short but his grab is pretty long. \n\nfor timing, for me it's something that I have a \"sense\" of, I don't check the clock very often. but when an enemy has recalled, I have a pretty accurate sense of when they return. I think, that I pick up the rhythm of arriving waves to time things with. I know other people remember exact times.. I don't know what time, but there's a time maybe shortly after 4 minutes where aggressive junglers make their first gank, and something like 6 minutes where the enemy buff respawns (although it sounds like buff camps will become global knowledge in an upcoming patch, at current you only know the time if you see the buff die)\nalso, even tho the game tells you the first dragon is at 5 minutes and first baron at 20, knowing this helps you plan even without checking the TAB menu. \n\nfor anticipating enemy movement. that is also something to learn with experience. as you play games, try to habitually check the map, and try to keep track of where enemies were and where they are later. and with experience you will start to be familiar with patterns. additionally, as you get better and understanding strategy, such as the split push, rotations, and start to notice people itching for a team fight, then you will start to expand that into predicting map movements. it's something to watch now, so that you can predict it later, after you get a lot of experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Peace Is Life","date":"2016-04-27T19:39:45.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for this man i appreciate this :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wînter Fox","date":"2016-04-27T03:27:42.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
