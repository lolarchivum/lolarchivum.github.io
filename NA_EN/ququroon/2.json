I agree! Some of them are terrible! Long story short, this is my bad- but I want to fix it.\n\nSo! Here&#039;s what the next steps will be. \n\n* I&#039;m currently making a list of all the SPs needing updates, and I&#039;m just about through. Your feedback and threads have been useful. My aim is to hit quite a few of them, including ones that could stand to be better by zooming out.\n\n* Next, we&#039;ll start the mass cropping. This should take a few patches of time [assuming no preseason madness], but hopefully not long. \n\n* Then it patches out. Hopefully everyone rejoices! I&#039;ll continue listening to your feedback. \n\nAnd yeah- that&#039;s it! I&#039;ll hang around in the thread a little bit if people have any questions. Have a nice day! o/","replies":[{"poster":"Namazu Ebisu","date":"2017-08-18T23:55:56.184+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Great thread. I'll be happy to contribute but for today there are only 2 i noticed while i played that were off (**quality of the thumbnails may vary it seems so be sure to click them xD**) :\n\nFrench maid Nidalee :\n\nIngame : https://puu.sh/xdvZZ/414e982978.jpg\n\nMy edit : https://i.imgur.com/F3qmJo9.png\n\nAs you can see the ingame one is zoomed and VERY saturated and low quality for some reason, i just took the splash and cropped it a bit and it looks way better imo.\n\n\n\nStar Guardian Lulu :\n\nIngame : https://puu.sh/xdsIW/e8757d86f2.jpg\n\nMy edit : https://i.imgur.com/8NGJdx0.png\n\nZoomed way too much and not centered. I'll be sure to hunt others as i play!  I could do the cropping stuff all day if you guys need some free help ahah... (i forgot to add the shadows around the portrait don't kill me).\n\nOverall, 90% of them are not centered and zoomed too much so it could be great to take another shot at it to show details on the faces like the basic portraits do : \n\nhttp://puu.sh/xdGPt/de7fc58d4f.jpg\n\n\nIf this was a skin, we would probably have only the eyes or something, which is bad! Show those beautiful heads & accessories!","replies":[{"poster":"Poppystar","date":"2017-08-19T01:10:08.614+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm agreeing with star guardian lulu.
