No. It has nothing to do with popularity (although French was the \"Lingua Franca\" of Europe and the world for a very long time) \n\nIn 1066 William the Conqueror, a Norman duke took the Crown of England, and in the process replaced a great deal of the local nobility who were Anglo-Saxon (strictly Germanic) with his fellow Normans. What eventually happened was Norman french became the language of the nobility while Anglo-Saxon became the language of the commoner, which lead to interesting dynamics like that a \"sheep\" in a field is a germanic root word while \"mutton\" being sheep meat came from French, as it was served on the table. It's a bit of a simplistic example but these class dynamics between \"simple\" germanic root words and more complex french root words appear over and over. \n\nOver time the two languages, the Norman of the nobility and the Anglo-saxon of the commoners fused into middle English because having such an intense language barrier is unsustainable between the vast majority of the ruling class and the vast majority of the common folk, as well as impractical. Middle English evolved into Modern English and as you would say \"voilà\".\n\nTldr; English is a Germanic-Franco blend because of William the conqueror.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-07-17T21:38:52.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Remlap1223,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=gsEcG6YK,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-07-17T06:53:03.328+0000)\n>\n> And that's why I didn't learn Chinese.
