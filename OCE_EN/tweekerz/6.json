Cause I've seen none, and only heard of one that was resolved within a week, so forgive me for being sceptical.\n\n>  there is no checking to make sure it fits a certain context.\n> its just \"tick the checkboxes until a ban is required\" ok.\n\nThe second half of that is basically true, the first half however, not so much. The system doesn't just look at keywords/phrases, and it doesn't only look at chat logs. It uses game data to determine in game behaviour patterns, it uses report accuracy history of those reporting as well as what those people normally report for, it uses the history of the person being reported, have they been accurately reported in the past? Have they been punished before?\n\nIn fact the system sees far more context than any person on tribunal ever did in the past. How pray tell is it so broken/not working when the negative players are being punished justly for their actions and the innocent players are not being punished?? It is working as intended. Perhaps it could work faster, but it's still much better than the systems that were in place previously.\n\n> So if said robot sees a robbery, it sees a robbery....\n\nYou're boiling it down to black and white, and that is not how Riot's automated system works. See above.\n\n> time in the world to code an exception for every single little fucking scenario that can happen, so they have to simplify it.\n\nAnd that is the whole point of allowing players to appeal bans. If a ban is unjust, and you appeal it, it will be resolved, simple as that. End of story.\n\n> You swear check mark.\n\nThe system doesn't give a rat's ass about swearing on it's own. Sorry but that just isn't how the system works, no matter how much you say it.\n\n> That is the only feasible way for the entire system to fucking work, anything more than that and you have a borderline AI which trust me, riot does not fucking have.\n\nWhy not? They're increasingly easy to develop, and Riot has significant resources at their disposal. What magical barrier is in place that prevents them from having a learning system exactly?\n\n> The most they can have is pattern recognition, and even that isnt fucking enough to replace the judgement of a real fucking human being.\n\nThe automated system was always meant to be a temporary measure until tribunal was finished, and probably will remain as an auxiliary feature once tribunal is out. And given it's results, it's doing a lot better than you seem to think, and generating much fewer false outcomes than old tribunal was on other regions.\n\nGive me one, just ONE example with evidence of someone who was unjustly banned and was denied an appeal.\n\n> If i say \"great ult ez\" every time ez missing his ult, what is the system going to do,\n\nIt's going to check who reported you, if there are any comments on those reports, if you have a history of negative behaviour, if the ezreal was responding to you and in what manner, and if all else fails in an ambiguous case a PERSON will see the log and decide.\n\n>  riot doesnt own a super computer\n\nThey don't need one, and their resources are pretty substantial as it is.\n\n> You know who can do that however? a fucking human.\n\nA team of people is going to go through thousands (it's way more than that btw, the system is on ALL regions) a day? Riot would have an easier time building the mother of all super computers, that's why tribunal is a thing.\n\n> Give them a copy of the replay data and the timecodes for the chat log and let them check with their own eyes, done and dusted bans become 10000% more accurate.\n\nWell obviously. But how many cases do you think someone using that system would get through in a day? Even being generous, and assuming it take's them 20 minutes a case that's only 27 cases in a 9 hour day with no breaks. \n\nThe system takes 15~ minutes to issue punishments, which means it takes a fraction of the time to evaluate a case and the rest is checking/human evaluation, and it can do a ton of them simultaneously. Sorry but no team of real people can keep up with that. \n\nThe system as it exists makes sense. The straightforward cases the system handles on it's own, the more ambiguous ones have human oversight.\n\n> cannot be accurate when the primary variable that it is checking, is human nature.\n\nAnd yet somehow it seems to be doing just that.\n\n> just go look at the first page of misc, i found atleast 10 threads all bitching about it.\n\nBoards is hardly an accurate representation of the majority of the playerbase. A large portion of boards is dedicated to people who come for one post and are never heard from again, the rest is the small boards community which have their own culture that only sometimes aligns with the views of the community as a whole.\n\nReddit would be a better representation of the communities feelings, and you rarely see a post hating on the report system there. Mostly it's only mentioned at all when something new comes out.\n\n> so why do they still run rampant and are so common that they outnumber the people who arent toxic\n\nThey don't. Boards has a disproportionate number of them because people use the boards to complain. In game it's rare to see that kind of toxicity regularly unless you are in very specific scenarios. \n\nThe low levels are hard to pin down because you get people who have been banned and are creating a new account. If they pull their bs again they'll either be banned again or pull their shit together enough to get the account to 30.\n\nThen of course there is low bronze, where the frustration of not going anywhere builds into toxicity (take a break if that's the case btw, no point playing ranked if it isn't getting you anywhere right?).\n\nMost everywhere else, sure it's around, but it's rare. I get a toxic/afk/negative etc maybe once in every 15 games TOPS, and the people I play with generally echo that sentiment. You can't rightly say I've just been lucky for the 2 and a half years I've been playing, that's not how chance works.\n\n> gold silver and bronze wouldnt be full of cancer.\n\nBut they aren't. Ranked is more likely to have negativity because of the extra pressure, the extra 'responsibility' there, but it's hardly full of it. The extra pressure also means that often you will find players that have one or two bad games but are fine otherwise.\n\nYou seem to swing between \"the system is too harsh and bans people unfairly\" and \"the system isn't harsh enough and isn't banning enough people\". There are obviously improvements that could be made, but again, tribunal.\n\n> You, yaia, and the rest of the riot endorsed forum members ARE NOT riot support.\n\nBut we DO try to respond to everyone. It is more beneficial if we can answer 10 people quickly and given them all a whole and correct answer to the question we are responding to then to only get through 1 person.\n\nIf fast answers are applicable we will use them, if they aren't we won't. It also depends on the time we have available. We aren't paid to do this, we do it on our own time.

If the player believes the punishment was in error, they can appeal through the punishment system. \n\nPeople being super toxic or intentionally throwing games (even if they say nothing in chat), still get picked up by the system and punished ([example](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken)).\n\n>Because lets face it, you may have full confidence in your automated system, but as someone who has dabbled in AI coding in the past, ** i know full well and much more than you atm** , that no system you have is capable of reading context, which is its major flaw.\n\nYeah, nah.\n While the system may not take into consideration complex contexts, it can take into consideration if you are making self depreciating comments (i.e, worst morgana OCE, when you are the morgana), or having banter with mates. \n\n\n>Leave-buster is pretty much the only automated system you own that actually makes sense, and its also the least capable because you don't recognized that fact and instead spend so much time trying to upgrade the systems that don't work, for instance did you know its possible to monitor packet loss between a client and a host? \n\nTricky subject, ultimately comes down to the fact people with unstable connections are ruining the experience for 9x other players with their disconnections/13456789 ping. There are ways around this for the players though, they can join one of the many clubs that do 5v5 customs so that if they DC they wont get busted. Riot also make allowances for the occasional internet problem (happens to everyone), but if your internet is regularly too unstable, probably best to pick another game.","replies":[{"poster":"Tweekerz","date":"2016-04-20T06:34:59.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the comment back about how to appeal false reports, that IS actually what I was looking for.
