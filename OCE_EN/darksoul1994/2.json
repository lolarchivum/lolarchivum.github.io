My main gripe is that the Riot Balance team **constantly lowers the skill** level of the game.

You will see in competitive that bot lane will be the focus for the jungler now. Top lane will be some broken tank like Orrn saying \"come gank me, i can see you a mile away\".\n\nWhy do they always pander to noobs? If you lower the skillcap of games, it won't improve noobs play, noobs will still be noobs. Supports will have a sightstone and still not ward. Gonna make it that supports all start with a red trinket next? Or remove boots from the game entirely? Or delete the minimap from the game?\nThey just end up frustrating those that enjoy the game for its skill.\n\nP.S. These 8.2 changes are also an indirect nerf to teemo.
