They also have to cover lanes, like mid, when this players decide to roam. The choices a jungler makes in early game regarding who to gank, and when/how to get objectives, which objectives to sacrifice, set the course for the rest of the game. Not to mention jugglers like Kindred also have the added bonus of chasing marks all over the globe.\n\n**Mid:** Firstly and most importantly, they have to not feed Zed/Yasuo/Fizz/Akali/Katarina etc etc. _(which is not easy)_ Secondly unlike side lanes, they are surrounded on all sides by jungle and bushes, and unlike bot, they cant ward it all. They have to keep up in CS while having to roam, and poking the enemy laner down enough so that they cant roam, while not being poked down themselves.\n\n**Top:** Being mostly melee champs who have to stand next to each other to farm, Top lane is basically one big duel all lane phase, they have to focus on being in battle pretty much constantly _(which while doesn't look hard, is very mentally draining)_, while trying to farm, push lane to keep the enemy jungler off other lanes. AND being pushers, they more often than not, are tasked with trying to get first tower objective.\n\n**Support:** Apart from babysitting the ADC, jumping in front of blitz and thresh hooks, and not taking One. Single. Farm. _(because the ADC will rage quit)_. They also have to have insane map awareness, be constantly warding. Predicting the engages of the enemy support and planning counter-engages.\n\n**ADC:** Literally, all you need to do for the first 20 minutes, is last hit minions. And if you somehow manage to fuck that up and get into a fight, you have a designated bodyguard to jump in front of bullets for you. The only thing you need concern yourself with all early game, is that your little number in the corner, is higher then their little number in the corner.\n\n__________________________\n\nHow about mid game:\n\n**Jungle:** Now on the defensive, they have to watch all lanes and defend whenever necessary, for the enemy will start to group or split push, as well as making picks and predicting/catching roamers out in the jungle. While still looking after objectives. Most tank junglers have lost their early game durability base stats, but don't have enough gold to get late game durability from items. Early game junglers like Shaco or Evelynn, are in a very tough spot if they haven't got kills by now. Kindred is sitting at base rocking back and forth wondering why on early she picked Kindred.\n\n**Mid:** Mid game is a mage's time to shine _(or ruin the game completely)_, they shoulder the majority of the weight in this stage, being 'controllers' they are now the primary damage for the team, as well as the CC machine, its their job to poke down enemies before fights, and help make picks before fights. Pretty much everything except tanking is their job mid game.\n\n**Top:** Deciding where, how, and when to split push. Not getting caught out when split pushing, and making sure that wherever they are splitpushing, they can still get to fights relatively quickly. Top lane has only just broken out of its perma-duel/bro-lane in top, so they know very little about how strong the rest of the enemy champs are at this stage. This is the time when your 5/0 Jax suddenly ends up at 5/7 because unlike mid and jungle, he hasn't got a good grasp of who he can and cant fight yet.\n\n**Support:** The same job as always, being the wading machine, diving in front of bullets, pulling people from the fire, singlehandedly warding EVERYWHERE, AND not taking One. Single. Farm.\n\n**ADC:** Yep, still farming. CS is worth more than kills. Be in the occasional teamfight, but otherwise be in the opposite lane that the split pusher is in, so that rascal doesn't take your precious CS. The support even has your map awareness covered, don't even need to bother wandering your gaze lazily to the right to check the map.\n\n\n____________________________\n\nLate game:\n\n**Jungle:** Be a meat shield for the ADC.\n\n**Mid:** Throw your CC, then be a meatshiled for the ADC.\n\n**Top:** Be a meat shield for the ADC.\n\n**Support:** You guessed it son!: Be a meat shield for the ADC.\n\n**ADC:** If it moves, right click it till it stops moving.\n\n\n_______________________________\n\nWhat my point here is, is that you're only considering difficulty from the point of view of an ADC, while the above looks at ADC from the other roles' perspective. Both sides are over-exaggerated. All of the roles have easy and hard aspects.\n\nTake the champs for example:\nThe difficulty in ADC certainly doesn't come from the champion pool...\n\nCompare your champs to another lane, like mid:\n\n**ADC:**\nMiss Fortune \nDraven\nKog'Maw\nSivir\nAshe\n\n**Mid:**\nSyndra\nLeBlanc\nAzir\nAurelion Sol\nOrianna\n\nTheres no comparison in which lane has the bulk of mechanically difficult champs, both to play, and to have to counterplay around.\n\nNor does the difficulty come from the mental game, Look at the number of things ADC has to think about in relation, to say, Jungle:\n\n**ADC:**\nCS\nKills\nPositioning\n\n**Jungle:**\nTower defence\nCamp clearing routes\nCS\nCounter-jungling \nLane holding \nObjective control \nGanking\nCounter-ganking\nTracking the enemy jungler\netc.\n\n\nWhere does the difficulty come from?\n\nIn my view, the hardest thing about the ADC role, is their need for good positioning _(and that is very hard indeed)_.\nGood positioning is the difference between that vayne that gets pentakills every fight, and the Jhin who gets pulled becasue he runs towards the enemy desperate to find something to use his 4th shot on.\n\nFighters and tanks can survive being out of position, and as long as they are in the thick of things, they are probably in-position anyway.\n\nMid laners have enough range to often safely sit on the edge of fights lobbing spells in, if they get too close to the action, many of them have escapes.\n\nSupports are weaving all through the fight, healing/shielding/tanking whoever needs them, they are only really out of position if they are not in the fight, or have left the ADC alone too long.\n\nADC's on the other hand, their range is short enough that that have to be close-ish to the fight, well in range of the mid laner's long shots, and at high risk of sudden engage from fighters like Camille and Irelia. But if they don't get in close, their team doesn't have enough damage.\n\nDo I think ADC is the easiest role? **No.**\nDo I think its the hardest role? **No.**\n\n______________________________\n\n#What do I think the hardest position is?\n\nIf I had to pick a role as hardest position, I would pick support.\nThey have so much to think about, and on top of playing themselves, they also have to play around the ADC as well.\nSupport champs often have all the mechanical difficulties that Mid lane champs have, except without any of the damage.\nRakan is just as complex to play as Viktor, but if they meet in the jungle, Viktor is the one walking out alive.\nSupport tanks get just as tanky as top lane tanks, but if they meet in the jungle, Nasus is walking out alive, and Leona isn't.\n\nUnlike every other position (ADC included) supports _(true supports, not shit like Brand etc.)_find it very difficult to function on their own.\nWhen youre the only one alive, and you're trying to save an Inhibitor from a huge wave of minions _(or even an enemy champ)_. Azir/Irelia/Kalista/Nocturne are gunna breeze through that situation, saving the inhib in moments. Nami will watch the inhib crumble as she desperately auto attacks 3 waves of minions.\n\nADC's and every other AD champ can push turrets very quickly, most of them can solo objectives such as dragon _(or even Baron)_ as well.\nMages have enough AoE to instantly clear waves around turrets so that their minions can focus on it.\nSupports are neither AD, or have big AoE damage. Leaving them unable to secure objectives alone _(even if no enemy champs are in sight)_ or take towers easily.\n\nGetting caught out in the jungle? most top laners and junglers will be fine duelling it out. Most mid laners have decent escapes and CC, or enough burst to dissuade an attacker. ADC's have enough damage out-damage the person who finds them. Supports die.\n\nSupports imo, have the least amount of things they are able to do alone. which makes them very heavily team reliant, and predicting what other players are going to do, isn't always the easiest.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-28T09:14:49.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to agree but disagree with your choice of the hardest role. While supports have a lot of responsibility, the difficulty of those responsibilities are not so severe. Not to mention how strong supports are made to be in order to be able to babysit their adc.\n\n1. Mid lane= Basically has a hand everything at all stages of the game. You say throw cc and be a meat shield. but neglect the fact not all mid laners are control mages. Some pick assassins, some pick sustain damage. \n\n2. Top lane= Majority of the macro responsibility. \n\n3. Support\n\n4. Jungle = Jungling is a breeze, you just have to pull off ganks and have good decision making.\n\n5.

For me it would be:\n\nTop: Just don't understand the lane, haven't played it enough so don't know the matchups, when to trade, when to roam, whether to take ignite or TP etc etc.\n\nADC: I'm absolutely trash tier at multitasking, and being a support main my CS skills are less than stellar (well below average for my rank). Trying to CS, keep my positioning, watch the map, manage waves etc etc, it's all just too much at once when I lack so much experience.\n\nMid: Easier wave clear (generally speaking) means it's easier to keep an eye on the map and positioning. More reliable poke (again generally) means I can afford to play much safer while still being relevant. Being closer to the other lanes makes it easier to make the decision to roam.\n\nJungle: My second role. I won't pretend I'm great at it, at best I'm passable, but I can usually manage farming and ganking fairly well and at the very least not be entirely or worse than useless.\n\nSupport: My main, so naturally the easiest role for me.\n\nLargely it just comes down to experience. I've played only a handful of top games in 5 years of playing, so it's a rather terrifying beast for me, while I've played support pretty much since roles became a thing for me (lvl 20~) so it's almost effortless.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-28T13:30:57.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed with Seras here.\nIt is a very personal thing.\n\nWhen I say 'support' as the hardest role, I'm speaking as objectively as I can taking into account all the things that role can/cant do, compared with other roles, and the responsibility they have.\n\nMy personal roles from easiest to hardest are:\n\n**Mid** - I play the 'mage' role is most games me and my friends play. So aiming and slinging spells feels more natural to me, so I'm attracted to champs that have that play style. I like clean clear actions, and a spell is just that. You see a concise purple blob leave Vel'koz fly across the map, and hit your face. Theres no cheeky on-hit %HP crit life-steal effects that come into the equation, what you see is what you get.\n\n**Support** - Support and mid share a lot of things _(theres a reason tons of mid champs get taken support, and some supports get taken mid)_, not least of these reasons is their reliance on clean direct skill shots and 'controlling' play styles. Many supports are very magelike. Not to mention bot lane is often the destination of my mid-lane roams, so I spend a lot of time in this lane even when Im a mid laner _(familiarity and all that)_.\n\n**Jungle** - I'm out of my comfort zone now, I know enough about the role to function as a decent jungler, but I'm far from having thought out jungle-clear paths and solid bank times, especially when things stop going to plan.\n\n**Top** - I despise this lane, I don't understand the matchups well, and things function in top very different to mid lane. Mid lane is like throwing stones at each other in the street, you know you're stronger than the other guy when your stones make bigger bruises than his stones. Top lane is like two beefy dudes bumping chests in a bar, you don't know who's stronger until one of you is on the ground. And I just cant seem to work out that dynamic. Not to mention you have the whole team screaming at you to 'stop Nasus farming' and I still don't know how, everything I throw at him he heals back, and it's me that ends up losing farm while wasting time hammering my fists aimlessly against him.\n\n**ADC** - Yes after this whole post, ADC is the hardest position for me _(personally)_ to play. I dunno what is it, but right-clicking is hard for me. Whenever I right click someone, they right click me back, and their right click does more damage than mine. Its not like a skillshot that I can aim and dodge, I feel distanced from my damage, and that means I can't control it well. Not to mention part of it is based on luck _(crit chance)_ and that adds uncertainty to the mix, which again is different to the mid lane mentality.\n\nI like the 'controller' play style, I like to have clear precise actions that I can measure and predict the outcome of, which is why I'm best at mid and support. \nI don't like the top/ADC playstyle where due to all the on-hit effects, crit strikes and AA buffers, _(often in really close proximity)_, you dont really have a clear precise view of where and how their _(or your)_ damage is coming from. You just seem to open up your abilities and hope that your DPS is better than theirs.\n\n________________________\n\nBut it's also highly dependant on what champs you play as well, e.g. Its quite possible that I find ADC so hard is because the only ADC i have ever put proper effort into playing is Kalista. Im sure that if I played Draven or Miss Fortune, id have an easier time.\n\nLikewise if you're gunna play Renekton or Illaoi, top is probably a lot easier than if you play Camille or Jayce.","replies":[{"poster":"Rectum","date":"2018-03-28T14:09:21.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is no where near the hardest role. They might have some of the mechanically demand champions, like thresh, rakkan and the like. But that beside the point. Support need their team inorder to do anything, that mean their team mate come with them to ward, such and such. \n\nThe rest of the laning phase is standard 2v2 and ganks, same with any others lane. But bott lane have 2 people warding. Engage and peel, any tanks can do that, soo what is so difficult about support compare to other lane? \n\nEvery roles has their struggles, to generalise a role is harder than the other is not taking others aspect of the game into question.
