That said, we've seen a few reports throughout the day from players who were previously having problems, but are now reliably able to connect to games.\n\nFrom our own metrics, it still looks like there are a few players still affected by this, but not as many.\n\nWhat I'd really like to know is if connection issues are still occurring for you.\n\n-----\n\n**Original Post**\n\n\nHi Folks\n\nFor those players who are having issues connecting to game after champ select, we feel your pain.  It&#039;s simply not OK that these issues are happening, and we want to do everything we can to help get things back to normal.  We haven&#039;t been talking much on the boards today, so I want to give a quick summary and update on where things are at.  \n\n**Investigation (so far)**\n\nOn Friday, we started to see a few reports of players unable to connect to games after champ select.  We could see from players on boards, and those submitting tickets to support that they were connecting via Optus.  Once we saw that there was a common theme, our initial focus was to ensure that we understand how many players were affected, and to try and figure out the scope of the issue, as well as whether it was an issue local to the LoL servers or something to do with Optus itself.\n\nAs a precaution we put up the notice you see in the client, warning to stay off Ranked.  While it is possible for us to help with leaverbuster bans from issues like this, fixing up LP lost is not something that we can do - [explained here](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/ARwIuupl-problem-since-last-night-game-wont-launch-after-champion-select?comment=000200000000).\n\nWhile investigating the players affected, we could see that they sometimes could connect to games, and sometimes not.  There didn&#039;t seem to be much of a pattern as to why.  Our engineering and network teams performed a thorough check over of the LoL servers, but we have not found signs of any issue so far.  Combined with the seemingly random nature of the problem, as well as the reports consistently coming through from Optus has led us to believe it is caused by something outside of the LoL service itself.   This doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re trying to wash our hands of the issue though.  If LoL players can&#039;t play, whatever the reason, it is definitely something we will be trying our best to help with.\n\nWe believe that there is a network issue which is causing traffic between Optus and LoL to get lost along the way.   We&#039;ve attempted to rule out intermediate ISPs (ie the carriers between LoL and Optus) by moving traffic between different paths, which has not done anything to help so far.\n\nWhere we are at now is that our network engineering team have reached out to Optus&#039; routing team to alert them that their customers are facing issues when connecting to League games, and to tell them what we are seeing from the Riot side.  We&#039;re waiting to hear back from them.\n\n\n** What can I do? **\nThe important thing here is to let Optus know that you are affected.  Feel free to point them to this thread if they would like more context.\n\nEthvn has created a helpful thread showing how you can talk to the Optus support team directly - https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/iu8pdy0q-for-optus-users\n\nThere are also Optus boards where you can join the thread highlighting the issues connecting to League (and any other services) you are seeing - https://yescrowd.optus.com.au/t5/Broadband-Telephony/League-of-legends-message/m-p/422504#M51254/jump-to/first-unread-message\n\nAdditionally, our player support team has been made aware of the issues for Optus players, and they will make sure to take this into account when dealing with any tickets that come through about leaverbuster / low priority queue penalties that you are getting as a result.   If you feel like you have been unfairly punished due to this issue, please send in a ticket so that your case can be looked into.\n\nThanks for reading.  We&#039;ll update as we know more, but in the meantime, let me know if you have questions.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2018-05-08T03:34:28.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Final Update - Tuesday @ 1:30pm AEST\nWe're fairly confident that the issue has been resolved now.

A downtime of nearly 2 days is quite unacceptable, regardless if it is an Optus-side or Riot-side issue.\n\nEdit: saying this because other games e.g. Fate G/O JP give out \"apology\" in-game currency just for doing weekly maintenance or slight downtime (few hours). Just thought it would be something to keep the community together since it seems everyone's starting to lose their minds, including myself (only really have weekends to play as often). \nRemoving leave-buster is not an issue if people just avoided playing the game as advised. The issue is more that people are **unable to play the game**, especially given the time it is taking to resolve the issue.\n\n> _**ALSO NOTE: Sometimes the service status warning in the game client WILL NOT SHOW.
