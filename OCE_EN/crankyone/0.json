Learn how they play and what their goals are. \n\nYasuo's goals are to bait out key skillshots (if any), abuse his mobility to punish his opponent(s) and whittle opponents down for an all-in. \n\nHow you counter Yasuo is by either punishing HIM for screwing up his trades or using his Q on creeps to farm or by being braindead and either shoving him in or letting him shove you in (depending on your champion and lane). \n\nTo truly counter him however you just press G->select the assist me ping and spam it on your lane and spam the attack ping on Yasuo. This way your jungler knows you want to camp the hell out of him. Yasuo is one of the weakest champions when it comes to dealing with jungle pressure, abuse it.\n\nAs for champions to pick when up against Yasuo....honestly you can pretty much pick anyone and you can punish him, just pick someone who you're comfortable on (if your champion has a key skillshot(s) then please, learn how to be patient with it/them the last thing you want if Yasuo eating it with Windwall).\n\nChampions I personally pick into Yasuo mid lane are:\n- Kat (obviously, she's my main), \n-Ryze (who cares if he eats a skillshot if it's only on a 2 sec CD, amirite?), \n-Zed (just be patient with Q), \n-Irelia, Lucian (lasers > windwall), \n-Azir, \n-Akali and \n-Orianna.\n\nChampions I pick against top lane Yasuo are:\n -Fiora (you almost hard counter him post level 3), \n-Nasus (just farm under tower DansGame), \n-Akali, \n-Riven (her all-ins >Yasuo's), \n-Maokai (what is damage OMEGALUL), \n-Malphite (what is damage OMEGALUL), \n-Irelia\n-Pantheon\n-Camille (W poke is broken) and next patch\n-Rengar","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-31T22:23:45.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"half your champions are very mechanical he wants easy ones lol\n\n{{champion:11}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:23}}  I use them","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-02-13T12:15:13.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, basically any tank or all melee champ just roflstomps Yas, provided you don't get cheesed at level 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-31T23:02:49.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"realistically you can even play rammus toplane into yasou.
