If you are a ranged champion you have an easy time harassing Illaoi {{champion:420}} and taking down her existing tentacles. If you are playing a tank, build armor asap and only take trades if you are sure you won't take tentacle damage or getting ganks.

Q heals her when she hits a champion, so watch out for that.\n\nE dodge it like a blitz/thresh/nautilus/amumu/leona hook. if you didn't dodge it. you need to know how your champion optimally deals damage. when she's wasted her Q and W on the spirit, remember you only take 40% of the damage you would have taken if hit directly. dodging EQ is paramount. if she hits you and your spirit at the same time, you'll take damage from both. \n\nE - spirit lasts 10 seconds, and is reduced by 1s each time you damage her. This is why it's important to know your champion. when she came out, i said i'm going to play shen/trundle/sion into this, 'cause i can do tonnes of damage while she's sitting on my spirit (after she's used her Q and W), thinking she's doing optimal damage. i guess poison/bleed is great, assuming each tick reduces spirit time.\n\nif you can't do either of these against her E, then you have no choice but to break the tether by running away, and being 80% slowed and becoming a vessel, where you and your team have to kill 3 tentacles to stop them from spawning on you.\n\ndestroy tentacles if safe to do so. don't let them bait you into her engage range or surprise gank. her W doubles her auto-range (roughly) and commands tentacles to slam the same target. (her W also has different interactions with counterstrike, parry, blind, aegis protection, spirit's refuge, if you would like to check ability details on wikia)\n\nand just run away from her ult. ult tentacles are untargetable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-03-22T05:20:06.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use Nasus if he is not banned.\nStack up damage by last hitting minions with your Q, if Illaoi denies you cs use your Q to last hit her tentacles.\nOnce you have enough stacks (abilities that multiplies itself when used), Illaoi will not beat you 1v1.\nIf Illaoi use her ult, you use your ult, or else if your ult is not available, run from her.\n\nOr else you can use Garen to beat Illaoi, just remember to start E, because Illaoi's Q seemed to have more area of effect damage, so you want to spin around her.\nIf she managed to rip your spirit with her E, if you are close enough, fight her and she will either retreat or take damage, otherwise run away, and destroy three tentacles to free yourself from her E or run far enough.\nIt is also important to not call ganks if Illaoi reaches level 6 (unless if the enemy jungler come to gank you), if you do, Illaoi may end up on using her ult and kill you as well as the gank or either one of you and cause the other a serious amount of damage.\nIf she use her ult, just run, don't fight.\nGet Sunfire Cape, and get boots early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-03-22T01:29:06.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you clear out her tentacles whenever you get a chance both in lane and after. Like everyone else says dodge her E. She’s a lane bully so early your always gonna struggle agaisnt her. Don’t try to harass her early unless your as big of a bully or you have a way to kill her tentacles from range. \n\nAfter lane. Make sure you rotate a lot. Don’t fight her after she’s set up 3 tentacles and the hits and ult to get another 3+. That’s how you get destroyed by her. If she’s set herself up around a turret. Rotate to another objective like dragon. She’s weak walking into a frame with no tentales set up\n\nShe has some harsh counterpicks. Personally I just pick nasus into her. You can q stack of her tentacles. All you need to do is play safe and scale up.","replies":[]}]}
