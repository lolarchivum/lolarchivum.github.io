After messing around with all the advice, I&#039;m fairly certain it is some sort of routing issue.\n\nI&#039;ve attempted every fix suggested, from changing internet ad security in internet options and ensuring TLS 1 and SSL 3 are checked. I&#039;ve re-synced my computers time, reset my internet options entirely and even changed my DNS to googles public domain. This issue is constant across all LoL devices.\n\nI placed an independent version of LoL on my laptop at a mates place, and the store worked fine. However, after taking it back home, it wouldn&#039;t connect again.\n\nFurther tests - I have tried to ping the OCE stores URL/IP &#039;192.64.169.23&#039;, and have had no packets sent, with a 100% packet loss.\nRunning a tracert shows the following:\n\nTracing route to 192.64.169.23 over a maximum of 30 hops\n\n  1     2 ms     1 ms     2 ms  [omitted]\n  2     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  3    16 ms    15 ms    17 ms  10.247.69.177 \n  4   444 ms   271 ms    39 ms  10.143.159.163 \n  5    38 ms    14 ms    21 ms  10.246.238.195 \n  6    19 ms    16 ms    15 ms  220.101.66.45 \n  7     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  8     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  9     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 10     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 11    42 ms    43 ms    44 ms  59.154.18.6 \n 12   203 ms   204 ms   225 ms  203.208.174.49 \n 13   205 ms   209 ms   203 ms  203.208.171.118 \n 14     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 15   219 ms   211 ms   208 ms  ae0.cr2.lax112.us.zip.zayo.com [64.125.32.78] \n 16   195 ms   196 ms   209 ms  ae16.er2.lax112.us.zip.zayo.com [64.125.25.158] \n 17   199 ms   218 ms   199 ms  64.125.170.174.t01598-01.above.net [64.125.170.174] \n 18   210 ms   204 ms   206 ms  104.160.133.35 \n 19   207 ms   216 ms   205 ms  ae32-br01.sjc01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.36] \n 20   223 ms   216 ms   218 ms  ae30-br02.pdx02.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.6] \n 21   225 ms   221 ms   218 ms  ae1-br01.pdx02.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.0] \n 22   249 ms   244 ms   232 ms  104.160.128.105 \n 23     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 24     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 25     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 26     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 27     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 28     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 29     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 30     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n\nTrace complete.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nI am not sure how to proceed - I am using a Huawei WiFi&reg; Cube 4G in order to connect to the internet with Mobile Wifi, as my rental property does not have a connected land line (before anyone suggests some sort of confrontation - a clause in my agreement states that although the property has phone jacks, I am aware there&#039;s no guarantee that they will be connected).\n\nI&#039;m not familiar with the user interface, but at face value there seems less room to change connection settings.\n\nI&#039;d really appreciate some help.\n\nEDIT: Also - I am unable to buy champions from my profile - the button says 'unavailable' and stays grey, and I cannot see the RP/IP costs for any of them.\n\nEDIT 2:\nI just ran a network analysis with The ICSI Netalyzr. The results were all green except for the following:\n\n**Minor Aberrations**\n-We detected at least one proxy\n\n**Reachability tests**\n-Direct TCP access to remote SMTP servers (port 25) is prohibited.\n\nThis means you cannot send email via SMTP to arbitrary mail servers. Such blocking is a common countermeasure against malware abusing infected machines for generating spam. Your ISP likely provides a specific mail server that is permitted. Also, webmail services remain unaffected.\n\n\n-Direct UDP access to remote SIP servers (port 5060) is blocked. \n\n_Hidden Proxy Detection: Warning_\n\nNetalyzr detected an FTP proxy. This is most likely due to the way a NAT or firewall handles FTP traffic, as FTP causes unique problems when developing NATs and firewalls. This is most likely benign.\n\nNetalyzr detected the following proxies:\n同ort: 21 (FTP), Response Time: 16 ms\n同ort: 80 (HTTP), Response Time: 24 ms\n同ort: 443 (HTTPS), Response Time: 25 ms\n同ort: 1723 (PPTP Control), Response Time: 0 ms\n\n\n**DNS Tests**\n-Your ISP's DNS resolver follows CNAMEs regardless of their location, but only after having learned that this nameserver is valid for the other domain. This is very unusual.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Valentinex666","date":"2016-03-24T01:07:37.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was This ever resolved?, I'm having the same issues while using a mobile broadband wifi modem with virgin mobile, Please let me know if you found a fix because I've been looking for weeks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Obikan","date":"2016-03-04T04:20:56.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still have no idea what to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Obikan","date":"2016-02-28T04:34:43.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, sorry for the late reply.
