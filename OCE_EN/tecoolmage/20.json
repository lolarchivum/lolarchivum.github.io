Crowd control literally means controlling a crowd of champions, so they can do as little as possible. And none makes them do as little as possible as Bard's ult.\n\nYou ult with Bard, your team gets in range and surrounds the enemy. Bard can drop a health pack and get his Q ready to stun two of the enemy champs once they come out of stasis. Then after that, his autos slow and deal damage. All the while, the enemy is UNABLE to do anything. Even with stuns, they can cleanse, or cast certain spells.

Bard is a difficult champion to master and I can tell by your attitude that you've either 1) tried to use Bard and failed or 2) have had him used improperly by someone on your team and ended up with the mental note that he doesn't have the best CC in the game. Watch an LCS level player use him and your bias will go.\n\nAs for Morgana's being longer. You are correct.

I'd also say Sion is better overall in general for CC over Bard due to ease of play.\n\nBut again, the most complete CC in the game is Bard's ultimate. You really cannot argue with it, and I'm not even going to debate it with you. You are wrong and I am correct. You cannot argue facts lol. Whether it's your opinion on whether it is better or worse in certain circumstances than other champion CC, that's a different story.

Definitely not what you're looking for in regards to wanting to still do damage while they're CC'd.\n\n2) Good CC champions are Bard, Zac, Sion, Braum, Thresh and champs with long snares like Morg and Lux.

His ultimate deliberately has a longer cooldown than other champs with similar CC because his strength lies in the utility of the combined flexibility of putting both allies and enemies in stasis. Using it on enemies only is a waste as you might as well just get the tank (malphite, Maokai, etc) to do that.\n\nNot only that, I didn't specify whether it was \"Best CC by The Spawn Man's standards\" or \"Best CC by situation/duration/cooldown\"\n\nBard's CC is the worst by the specific situation and context of this discussion (stopping _enemies_ specifically) but is good in general usage as not everyone has a Zhonya's and everyone knows how useful that is.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-25T08:51:34.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Again, you obviously have never played with anyone who knows how to use Bard's ultimate offensively very well. You're forgetting how extremely long the range of Bard's ultimate is, able to stasis enemies trying to escape from some distance away. That glorious few seconds of stasis allows the rest of your team to catch up and get the kills which otherwise would have escaped behind a tower or back to base.\n\nIf you're going to argue about duration, and keep fanning the Morgana fanboy fire, then here's a list of Bard vs Morg: Duration - Morg wins of course, but not by like a massive margin, by a bit. Number - Bard can stasis every single champ in the match if they're in the ult's AoE; Morg can only snare one, with a very narrow skill shot. Range - Bard's ult out-ranges Morg's ult by a country mile. Versatility - Bard can status allies for protection, enemies to stop them escaping or stop their ultimates, towers for protection or tower diving, etc. Morg can snare a single enemy. Cool down - Bard's loses by quite a bit, but with such powerful CC, you only need it once per team fight and they only come once every so often (plus it's an ult, which are meant to take longer). Completeness - Morg's snare can be cleansed, reduced in length with tenacity, even escaped (lantern). Bard's cannot be escaped. You cannot cast anything while in stasis.\n\nHead to head, Bard's is better CC. /argument.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-27T09:38:46.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And just to confirm that even the community thinks you're wrong, here is a post I started.

It in no way defines the effectiveness of CC and instead defines how safe it is for the caster.\n\nWhen you CC someone, what does define the effectiveness of CC is what allies can do that was otherwise inhibited by lack of CC. Being able to attack enemies without response is one. Escaping is another. By hitting both allies and enemies, the effectiveness of that single casting is dependent on what the remaining allies and enemies can do. A bard has less situations to use his ulti offensively because team fights will rarely have their front lines far away from each other unless they're both extremely long range.\n\nStasis on allies is a completely different subject and has nothing to do with the current context and even the literal wording of the title.\n\nIf you're using Bard's ulti offensively only, and thus having the minimum cooldown for offensive CC, you're doing it wrong. Leona has a stun for that, Heimer has a basic ability for that. Ekko, even Soraka has abilities that would be better suited for this purpose. \n\nBy this specific context without any cherry picking on LCS plays, Bard's ult sucks /Actual plausible argument\n\nAlso, \"Bard can stasis every single champ in the match if they're in the ult's AoE; Morg can only snare one, with a very narrow skill shot.

Ha.\n\nYou are one seriously funny guy. I can't tell if you're trolling or if you're legit this stupid. Range. Doesn't. Matter. That's the argument you're going with here? You're telling me that if you could add double the range to Morg's snare, you wouldn't? Range is always good and the more range, the more options.\n\nOkay, riddle me this, because I honestly have been in this exact situation many times. You've taken part in a quick team fight. You've peeled for your ADC and picked off an enemy. The rest of your team has won their little part of the team fight, and the two remaining enemies that weren't killed have turned and fled. You're too far behind the rest of the team to auto slow them, and they've got a head start on the rest of your team, so what do you do? If only there was some sort of long range, stasis CC that could stop them from escaping by allowing your team to catch up! I mean, if you could do that, it'd be an ace, both a moral and strategic victory.\n\nOh yeah, Bard's ult. Throw it, stasis the two remaining enemies, let your team catch up, they wipe them off the face of the Rift and you and your adc catch up to take an inhib.\n\nThe number of times this *exact* scenario has happened while I've played Bard is countless, and those few seconds of stasis which cannot be cleansed, escaped or prevented, to allow your team to catch up, are the difference between an ace and getting inhibs into Baron, or getting maybe an inhib turret and then getting beaten back by the freshly returned remainder of their team.\n\nWhat could Morg do in that situation? Nothing. Even if she was closer, right on their heels, she could still ever catch one. Who cares if you can hit the enemy while they're snared; once they come out of a Bard stasis, with a your team waiting outside, they're as good as dead anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-23T11:13:22.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:40}}  my fav","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-09-14T23:43:34.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cc machine (morgana)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-14T22:57:04.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naughty Naut for sure!
