Your e's if managed right zone him pretty hard since they burst his passive and are near impossible to dodge through dashes. Your q is hard to land unless you can predict his movements but the point is that you sustain more than his tornado thing and zone him pretty easy with some natural tankiness. Your w shuts down his dashes and leaves him awkwardly walking through minions to back off. His ult is the great bit though since you have alot of natural tankiness you just need to play safe and if he is dumb enough to ult you, you can still drop a q underneath yourself, w silence him and then aa with e and proc thunderlords and then feast him and he's often screwed. Cho'gath is really easy to play and yasou has a really hard time in lane with him so even if they have much superior technical skill; they will probably still lose lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"T3H UB3RN07","date":"2016-07-27T13:38:34.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"until you learn his biggest counters are zed and yi... and you're like \"That doesn't solve the problem\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-27T11:20:32.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah dude, i was 0/3 against a zed and i silently farmed all game....I came back almost full build and AA'ed zed to death XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-26T21:56:17.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His early game is a bit weak, but he scales a fuckin' ridiculous 100% and 150% and can achieve 100% critical strike chance with ease.\n\nThere is a reason he is banned in high ELO.

The worst part about this is this matchup never goes even and one side will feed like crazy and then the rest of the team has to struggle with a super fed hypercarry.  Whilst the other team has to deal with a yasou that is 4 levels behind and has 8 farm by 20min. Also he's a problem in low elo's and unranked because there isn't enough tanks and cc.\n If you can counterpick him it's not that bad, at low elo there is no way a decent cho'gath will lose to a yasou. The yas will try to outplay the cho'gath and the cho'gath will wonder what outplay tastes like and eat him. There's a number of matchups that yasou won't enjoy in mid or top.\nThe worst bit is how toxic yasou players seem to be. It's the new riven. You could be going 0-1-4 and the yasou will still flame you for 'feeding' and or if you're on the enemy team and you win lane; they will just start filling the chat with complaints about how your champion is op and unbalanced and requires no skill even if you're playing midlane soraka (mid was afk I am aware this is S6). And they always threaten to dodge if you don't pick a knockup comp; which is super irritating if they lose lane hard and do no damage.\n\nHis dashes, high damage, windwall and lifesteal from warlords bloodlust is annoying too because you pick a fight with him when you have full hp and he has the tiniest speck of health and he still walks all over you if he's ahead and you don't have cc.\n\nI acknowledge he takes alot of skill to play but I'm getting tired of seeing yasou (and alot of other super meta picks) in every game.
