Also, just for your information, the more you spam ban less they will consider using that ban, while the fewer you ban and the more who get punished, the more your reports are considered.\n\nSo its not a 1 in 500, its a 1/10, which gets reduced every time you report someone just because you were a little

themselves and the inadequate performance of the mmr system.\n\nAnd btw before you are like \"well if you were good your mmr would be higher\" or bring up my winrate again.\n\nMy winrate is going up by about 1% every 30 days give or take.\n\nAs in the more games i play, the higher my winrate.\n\nThat doesn't show that i belong in this elo, that shows that i am currently in a state of fixing a statistical outlier in my match history.\n\ni predict ill be at 50% winrate in about half way through October and will continue to rise since i am a mere 28 games away from equilibrium and have been hovering between 28 and 20 games for the last couple days with it only returning to 28 after a particularly bad game tilting me and turning into a lose streak.\n\nBy that logic though i wont be silver this season, but ill expect atleast b2 if not b1 before the season ends.\n\nAssuming i keep my head level, and dont run into complete retards too often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-09-01T05:52:06.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry sweety but you already own the title of biggest ass in oce.\n\nYou reply to pretty much every one of my comments and you have the exact same \"holier than thou\" attitude every time.\n\nFor instance remember that one you came in and bitched where i was complaining about smurfs?\n\nThankfully im friends with some of the emissaries and while you were bitching your ass off they were helping me get the %%%% banned, because they reviewed his match history and realized i was right.\n\nBut yeah, keep going around thinking you are right because you have a biased opinion about me.\n\nOh and what costitutes a report from me?\n\nintent feeding.\n\nHarassment of teammates that goes beyond the simple \"you are bad and should go back to bots\" im not hypocrit im not gonna report someone for saying the same shit i do, but if they actually harass them and dont have a point, you bet your ass they are getting reported.\n\nLike i said, bronze is just that full of toxicity and trolls.\n\nIts not your fault though sweety, being silver 4 for what im gonna assume is a long time, you havnt to deal with the level of bullshit thats down here in awhile.\n\nWhile the skill differential is minor between bronze and silver (before you complain that im saying you are as good as a bronzie, its true, im currently premade with 2 people who were silver last season and one bloke who was gold last season, and i was b1 in silver promos, we are all stuck in b5 right now, you arent better than us) the attitude is very different, People down here consist of literal fucking children, stoners and other drug addicts, smurfs that cant handle their own elo, and %%%%s like me who get tilted easily and often, its a breeding ground for toxicity and tilt, real tilt, not \"oh im not in a good mood right now\" i mean \"oh fuck this my team wont engage so ill fucking engage for them useless %%%%s\" where if you were in a good mood youd stop and think \"thats a retarded idea\" the kind of tilt that makes you think emotionally.\n\nLike honestly mate everyone fucking agrees with that, fuck im friends with a couple diamond players who agree with me that bronze, is the fucking hardest elo to climb out of, not because the players are good, on the contrary its because of how bad they are, unless you are ghandi himself and have achieved nirvana, you will tilt period, you will get angry at trolls, period, and you will end up being toxic,
