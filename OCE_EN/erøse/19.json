If top lane is losing I should be helping them.... but also not abandoning my adc. Also if I steal the enemy blue as zilean, the midlaner gets mad that i have a blue and they don't, since 'zilean doesn't need blue'.  I end up having to babysit everyone, ward everywhere even though sightstone has only 3 charges and vision ward can only have 1 up, I have to roam top, mid and help the jungler with their invades because they generally do this when they can't actually outfight the enemy jungler alone whilst also guaranteeing my adc has a good time otherwise they'll report me for being a bad sup even though they died 5 times the number of anyone else even though I revived them every time my ult was off cd. I do play jungle alot but I feel the support gets just as much blame.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-03T08:06:32.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well personally I really couldn't blame any particular team mate unless they were really bad but that aside, \n\nMore than often though they search for a reason they sucked and then try to pin it on the jungler for not ganking. If a jungler didn't gank a particular lane there might be a reason for that, he might be focusing farming or ganking other lanes depending on the state of the game. In fact people should play as if no there was no jungler on there team and learn to play from behind, to play safely. Yes if you get 4 man ganked you are pretty much screwed but you know what, those 4 men ganks mean there is now 2 other lanes where 4 people are not giving room for others to push so if you just stall them out you can secure an advantage for your team even if it means your death.\n\n:P\n\nEven if you fell behind in an uneven match up, a gank might not even turn your lane around it's important to figure out what you can do when the odds are not in your favour. \n\n\nAnd I certainly wouldn't blame you for even taking allied blue since ZIlean is a very inefficient mana machine. \n\nEarlier I was playing with a Zilean support( I used to main ZIlean) who wasn't really up to scratch with landing his stun or his ult correctly but I wasn't gonna rage because well for one it was normals and I realize that even if Zilean's choice in champion left him unable to peel for me I realize that my own decision making could've been better as well. I died quite a bit in that game but I focused on farming and catching out target when I could, knowing that Zilean's stun is at times utterly unreliable.\n\nThe same goes for a fed champion, you don't go to 1v1 a fed laner because that is just dumb in retrospect unless you're one of those CC heavy burst champions like Jax or Irelia. You instead adapt and try to apply yourself to the current situation. Blaming people for feeding does nothing,  instead it's better to spend time thinking about what you can do to turn it around and what are your options.

Also zileans has great peel and provides alot of damage as most mage supports do. \n\nAlso I took the enemy blue, NOT our blue, the ENEMY blue from the enemy jungler and then ran away spamming my laugh. As a support I feel you should never take buffs, but enemy buffs are fairgame if you can steal them.\n\nWhy do people pick on you for stealing enemy buffs? Isn't it a good thing? The jungle is supposed to steal buffs but who says the support can't qwq the enemy jungler's buff before they smite it?","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-03T09:53:59.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean's peel is crap against anything that has a gap closer relative to other supports and he doesn't provide consistent damage due to how easy it is to avoid Zilean's bombs unlike other mage supports, don't even get me started on Yasuo match ups.

He's got good range and often it's easier to qwq a minion or ally than go for an enemy even if it pushes the wave a little if you need some desperate peel. I don't know; zilean has always felt reliable for me and his bomb poke is really hard to avoid if he's played botlane. Always remember to aa harass since he has a great aa animation and a range to match most adcs; it doesn't do much damage on the face of it but it quickly adds up to alot of harass in lane. Your damage to enemy champions bar at the end of the game with a utility build should be 30% physical, 70% magic damage and you should always push under tower if the enemy and your adc backs since you push hard and fast and you need early gold to get a tear and sightstone,\n\nIMO only an amateur zilean will use his qwq every time since this burns alot of mana and should only be used to lockdown enemies for the kill or to peel. By using one q at a time when trading, you conserve alot of mana which he doesn't have much of and if they suddenly turn around on you, you can more reliably get the stun off since they will be focused on the attack and won't have time to dodge it. I see soo many zileans use the e immediately as soon as they stun but in actuality you should wait till they're just about to come out of stun for an almost inescapable perma slow-stun lockdown. \n\nThese are just some of many things I've noticed when I play zilean compared to other zileans and first timers (I'm still learning and I've yet to try ranked with him, I'm bronze 5 atm and if he stops getting banned by my team I will try to use him to climb, since I've yet to do bad with him and I get S- or higher in 80% of my zilean games). He's simple so all these other things can make him alot stronger and are easier to focus on. I feel his utility is much better than his damage atm and he's best built full cdr and put botlane as a sup. Also his revive on that 32s cooldown makes it one of the strongest, funniest and easiest to use ults in the game if used right.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-03T13:59:24.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I friggin love playing zilean atm since compared to all the other champions, he's the only one where I consistently do great (though I'm pretty decent at most supports for my elo) and he has a huge impact on low elo games. He has alot of map pressure, he can splitpush hilariously, he's got some massive cc if you can pull it off and he can offer amazing support if anyone on your team gets ahead.

His micromanagement skills are fantastic on a level but at the same time he falls short in some areas where others excel. I can't blind pick Zilean into a ranked game. \n\nI know I'm gonna sound like a meta drone or whatever but with the current state of a game Zilean is a hit or miss at least for me. Zilean can and does work especially in the hands of someone who can use his abilities to the full extent of their utility. \n\nHowever when the enemy picks tier 1 supports namely, Sona, Alistar, Blitzcrank, Leona, Nautilus, or even Morghana Zilean begins to struggle if they are competent at those champions. Why? Because Zilean isn't mobile or doesn't put out CC as consistently. How about Fizz, Ekko, Talon, Ahri, or Malzahar being picked into the mid lane so that when laning phase ends, life gets a lot more difficult for Zilean. These aren't the only ones btw but the reason I bring them up is not because of FOTM but the fact that I see them a lot and are common picks into those lanes.\n\nPersonally would only pick Zilean mid if the enemy laner and jungler have already locked in because it only takes one second for them to make a decision to camp out in mid or the enemy support making a counter pick for Zilean like Lee sin or hecarim.

Morgana+Sivir botlane makes you next to useless and I don't feel with the meta that taking zilean mid would be a good idea...\nZilean's stuns should be consistent otherwise he's not a good zilean though and leesin is only a counter if the leesin can insec and is not bronze. I want to play zilean in ranked since he's by and large the champion I'm best at but nobody lets me... or the enemy has a morgana, leona, nautilus, sivir, kalista, caitlynn, shaco, talon, hecarim... there is a pretty long list and then I'm like nope this ain't gonna work.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-04T09:22:37.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yah, my point is dat Zilean can work but there's so many specific counterpicks that are very popular in the current meta that may not directly counter Zilean but do things ZIlean can't really beat or overcome. \n\nI listed Lee sin because he possesses the feature ZIlean is specifically weak against and that's mobility and burst. Zilean is also weak against poke lanes since he has no sustain against enemies and lacks the range to deal damage against the likes of a Vel'koz or Ezreal.\n\nThe issue with ZIlean's stun is that he has to land not one but two skill shots which are basically ground targeted that have to land directly on top of one another. Granted there are tricks around this such as using it on a minion or using your slow to  control the enemy to make them easier to bomb but against mobile enemies it's very hard to land such as ezreal and lucian. whereas linear skill shots are far more effective and reliable and controlling one target if that makes sense. \n\nYasuo whose a very common mid and top pick nowadays simply having his presence in the enemy team can negate your damage as zilean as a whole.
