The system NEEDS to only devalue reports when they are actually shown to be false not just when they don&#039;t pass punishment, if there is reportable behaviour in 90% of games, and someone reports 90% of the time they are actually doing the work you want them to do and yet you&#039;re devaluing their input.\r\n\r\n2nd) It&#039;s very RNG and the community is so filled with toxicity that you can&#039;t actually trust majority voting. There&#039;s 3 types of players in leagues - 1) /muteall 2) hardcore flamers 3) Calmers who try to relax everyone. It&#039;s important to know which group the reporter is from - For example - Group 1 people rarely report and when they do it&#039;s less a reflection of the toxicity of the person they reported but rather a build up from multiple games that breaks them and then all that weight you&#039;ve granted them slams down on 1 person not because they were so bad it was deserved but because the reporter has had an unrelated series of bad games.\r\n\r\nBasically my point is that the current &quot;weighting&quot; system for reports is flawed and needs review but this isn&#039;t the end, reports/bans are not the ultimate solution, it&#039;s like making drugs illegal - very taxing and hugely ineffective. The real question is why are people so angry in Leagues? LoL definitely has one of the worst communities of any game I&#039;ve ever played, I think most people would say that this is just what the individual people who make up the community are like but I would argue that it&#039;s much more to do with the experience of playing LoL - As someone who&#039;s played on and off since S1 these are some of the main factors I&#039;ve noticed for tilting people that you could actually do something about.\r\n\r\n1) Mute function - People don&#039;t use it nearly enough. Why? Because the person yelling at them, is still yelling at them, just because they can&#039;t read it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not happening and if you want to win the game, you need all your team mates to be focused on the game. Suggestion: when someone mutes a player, it should come up on the players screen saying &quot;X has muted you&quot;. Very simple feature but it will give the person muting a small sense of pleasure (encouraging them to use it) and it will undoubtably confirm for the aggressor that no one is seeing their spam (encouraging them to stop flaming and focus on the game) this is very important because at the moment the aggressor would just continue to flame into deaf ears.\r\n\r\n2) Bans vs chat restriction - Bans are brutal, chat restriction is annoying but doesn&#039;t ruin someones day or even week, infact being chat restricted is almost a relief. I don&#039;t think that anything said in game should be a bannable offense, after all, that&#039;s what the mute function and adult language filters are for. If someone is still playing the game but just being an ass to other players about it, prevent them from typing. Toxicity comes from frustration- bans cause more frustration, chat bans don&#039;t so use them much more.\r\n\r\n3)  The climb... - Climbing in leagues is like no other game I&#039;ve played... It&#039;s incredibly rough. Not only are you 1 player of 5 on a team meaning your impact on the game is limited, your MMR is SO slugish. You could play like a god and win 10 games in a row and only move up 1 division, this is actually insane. I travel to the EU a lot and so I have an account there as well and unsurprisingly it is VERY different but beyond all the community differences is an actual difference in leagues - Having climbed through divisions into plat on my EU account I could see very clearly the changes in the quality of players as I progressed. However in OCE there were people I vs&#039;d in bronze equally skilled with people I vs in gold right now, the differences are very small. \r\n\r\nThis is a really big problem because the whole point of ranked Leagues is to master the game and be recognised for your skill and that core part of the game is broken in OCE. I think the root cause of this issue is due to the much smaller player base - less players = bigger &quot;span&quot; of divisions in games, at the moment I can have people in my game anywhere from high silver to low plat meaning that even if everything was actually working perfectly, my impact on the game could be very easily trumped by a plat player laning against a silver player. You could argue that over the long term your skill will distinguish you and get you rating but when the player base is small it makes the division range high and then because the system doesn&#039;t work in the short term you get games where the end result rarely has anything to do with your personal performance. Now add in people getting auto-filled and you realise the result is FAR less to do with your level of play and much more to do with RNG, who got their mains, team compositions, who&#039;s 1 trick pony got banned etc etc. People can only handle being surpressed by RNG for so long without seeing their skill difference recognised before they lose their minds.\r\n\r\nTo wrap everything up \r\n\r\n1) Toxicity is rampant in OCE\r\n2) The automated report system gives weight to reports for the wrong reasons making it ineffective at deterring flamers\r\n3) Muting players is invisible, unrewarding, ineffective and therefore doesn&#039;t get used\r\n4) Toxicity stems from frustration -&gt; Bans = more frustration but chat-restrictions don&#039;t\r\n5) MMR is way too slugish for the small OCE player base - More reactive MMR will allow people to move around in divisions before they&#039;re worn down by the 100 game grind in &quot;law of averages&quot; - which is likely to fail them anyway.\r\n\r\nDidn&#039;t even mention earlier but there needs to be use of actual ingame performance in LP awarded calculation because people win the lottery every day and that&#039;s 1 in millions, having a system purely built on law of averages creates frustration via luck. In a perfect world there would be a panel of judges watching every player in every game and awarding points based on performance not result, obviously that&#039;s impossible but Riot should be pushing to have as much performance weight over result as feasible\r\n\r\nSorry about such a long post but if these issues were addressed the rampant toxicity on OCE servers would definitely drop, if you disagree I&#039;d be keen to hear your views\r\n\r\nTY for reading \r\nEven with all the toxicity &lt;3 Leagues\r\n\r\nPS: I totally forgot to mention this but can Riot do something about game names? I&#039;ve seen &quot;Black Fucking %%%%%%&quot; &quot;GL HF KYS&quot; &quot;Death Rapist&quot; and so much more... There&#039;s giving freedom in naming and then there&#039;s this","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-03-11T00:49:45.953+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey :)\n\n_Interesting points you have brought up and thank you so much for putting it into a positive discussion format! _\n\n> 1st) I was diamond back in S3 but haven't played much since and this season I've been climbing from bronze and am currently in mid gold. There is without a doubt reportable/bannable behaviour in 90% of games. 90%!! This is a major issue when your system devalues people who are constantly reporting others. The system NEEDS to only devalue reports when they are actually shown to be false not just when they don't pass punishment, if there is reportable behaviour in 90% of games, and someone reports 90% of the time they are actually doing the work you want them to do and yet you're devaluing their input.\n\n[Good thing is that reporting others (even if you report them a lot) doesn't actually devalue your report](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/9VrUtrJo-being-solo-and-having-a-team-report?comment=00000000000200000000000000000000000000000000). Only one report is needed to trigger a review, and if someone is reported the game will be reviewed. \n\nSince IFS was implemented a few years ago it has grown pretty significantly in being able to detect verbal toxicity (which is pretty great, seeing as this is a pretty big ongoing problem).\n\n Unfortunately it is still quite crappy when it comes to behavioral violations since those are are harder to detect for the system, and easier to conceal for the offending player. \n\nWith the \"one report needed\" thing, we can hope it continues to get better at detection and that we will see the instance of \"reportable/bannable\" behavior down. \n\n> 2nd) It's very RNG and the community is so filled with toxicity that you can't actually trust majority voting. ... reporter has had an unrelated series of bad games.\n\nOnce again, report weight is no longer a thing so you need not worry about situations like this. \n\n\n> 1) Mute function - People don't use it nearly enough. Why? Because the person yelling at them, is still yelling at them, just because they can't read it doesn't mean it's not happening and if you want to win the game, you need all your team mates to be focused on the game. Suggestion: when someone mutes a player, it should come up on the players screen saying \"X has muted you\". Very simple feature but it will give the person muting a small sense of pleasure (encouraging them to use it) and it will undoubtably confirm for the aggressor that no one is seeing their spam (encouraging them to stop flaming and focus on the game) this is very important because at the moment the aggressor would just continue to flame into deaf ears.\n\nMuting is interesting. Like you said, even after you mute someone the damage has been done and the flamer is still going to continue on. With your suggestion though, my experience has been that even after someone mutes someone in my game and tells them so, the flamer continues to berate them even if it does fall on deaf ears (and thus continues to spend more concentration on the chat instead of the game). If it was implemented, a little message that is official and does confirm that the person has been muted it *might* help, although I am skeptical. \n\nI agree with a post someone made a while ago about a pop-up at the end of game reminding you to report the players that you muted. Too often we mute someone because of their flame and forget about it, often leading to players such as this not getting punished. After all, we don't report ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ , the players wont get punished and the system will not learn. \n\n\n> 2) Bans vs chat restriction - Bans are brutal, chat restriction is annoying but doesn't ruin someones day or even week, infact being chat restricted is almost a relief. I don't think that anything said in game should be a bannable offense, after all, that's what the mute function and adult language filters are for. If someone is still playing the game but just being an ass to other players about it, prevent them from typing. Toxicity comes from frustration- bans cause more frustration, chat bans don't so use them much more.\n\nAt the moment the punishment comes in 4 steps. Three chances to realize your behavior is unacceptable and that you need to stop. \n* First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n* Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nIf you haven't worked out why your behavior is not ok after two warnings, it means that another chat restriction probably isn't going to help. At all points of the punishment system players are encouraged to speak to a support agent to discuss the behavior that is getting them in trouble so that they may learn from their mistakes and continue forwards a punishment-free player. \n\nObviously you wont be getting chat banned if you are pulling off behavioural toxicity such as inting, you will start at the two week ban. \nIf your verbal toxicity is also pretty hardcore (homophobia, racism, sexism, encouraging self harm) then you will also start on the two week ban tier because you should be smart enough to know that that kind of shit is never ok. \n\nI disagree with you saying that nothing you say in game should be bannable. I absolutely think that people that are dumb enough to use slurs and tell people to kill themselves should be banned. Words like that have so much power, and sometimes people don't really understand the impact that these kinds of words can have on people. I have few friends that get upset about some of the homophobic slurs after their families used them as they were thrown out of the house and disowned. \nCan you imagine how shitty it would be to have those memories dredged up because you failed a gank?\n\nI also believe that people who are constantly spurting low grade toxicity towards their teammates should also have to be held accountable for their actions. Telling your support they are trash and should uninstall isn't going to help them play better and is a pretty dick move. So is dwelling on the mistakes of others, especially when you are gonna be making a fuck tonne yourself.\n\nOf course teammates can mute, but like I said earlier, [at that point the damage is done](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/0gFPUhA8-second-thread-blahblahblahblahblah?comment=00010001000000000000). You may have ruined the one game a day that a person had time for. They might be using video games as an escape from some real life troubles and aren't in a good headspace. You probably would have tilted them and made them hyper aware of their every movement and as a result their play becomes worse. \n\n> 3) The climb... - Climbing in leagues is like no other game I've played... It's incredibly rough. Not only are you 1 player of 5 on a team meaning your impact on the game is limited, your MMR is SO slugish. You could play like a god and win 10 games in a row and only move up 1 division, this is actually insane. I travel to the EU a lot and so I have an account there as well and unsurprisingly it is VERY different but beyond all the community differences is an actual difference in leagues - Having climbed through divisions into plat on my EU account I could see very clearly the changes in the quality of players as I progressed. However in OCE there were people I vs'd in bronze equally skilled with people I vs in gold right now, the differences are very small.\n\nI have heard quite a few people say that in bronze-gold is pretty much the same but with slightly increasing mechanics, plat is where a little bit of macro comes in and that the jump from D4/5 to D3+ is bigger than the jump from bronze to plat. \nIt's basically the nature of the server. You will also find that a good portion of players in your games will be lagging due to the quality of internet in the countries that OCE encompasses, and this has a pretty big impact on how well players will be playing. \n\nYou could play like a god in 10 games and win every one and move up one division, but it could just be a fluke. It's such a small sample size. If you continue playing like a god, then yes, your MMR will accelerate and you will start skipping 1-2 divisions at a time. Sometimes you can even skip promos. Your MMR has to be decent to begin with, otherwise it can and will take a while for it to get to that point. \n\nIt's better to keep the climb slow and steady though, or you will find things similar to what happened after ardent last season. People who play champs strong in that meta were gaining so much rank. Once the ardent boom was over, they struggled to keep their new ranks and slid their way back down. A good player should be able to adjust and climb steadily so they are able to consistently maintain their rank. The current MMR system allows this. It also allows smurfs to easily rise back to a suitable rank for them, after all, if you know how to climb it isn't that hard. \n\n\n\n>Didn't even mention earlier but there needs to be use of actual ingame performance in LP awarded calculation because people win the lottery every day and that's 1 in millions, having a system purely built on law of averages creates frustration via luck.

You can sit in a side lane and just farm and not help your team and get a good score. Likewise, you can use yourself as bait (like I had a 3/16 teemo jungle do) and allow your team to push objectives on the other side of the map. There are far too many variables for something like that to work.","replies":[{"poster":"ForTheCode","date":"2018-03-12T05:26:46.728+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=ZkUwoV40,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-11T00:49:45.953+0000)\n>\n>\n> \n> Muting is interesting.

I think warnings need to come back into the system... Say the system notices your stats being quite low K/D/A, CS, level etc,  you should get a warning saying along the lines of we have noticed poor play etc etc but i can see why people would say that could be demoralizing for people who are just really bad at the game but im talking after 4/5 games and a kda of like 2/10 something like this... Would be a lot quicker than the system we have now..\n\nBack when i was on NA i got banned for a week for simply being bad... literally wasn't inting in the games and the comment from the person who reported me said \"bad kda and bad cs as caitlyn adc) i think i went 2/7 something roughly  and there was two examples of me being bad i'm not sure over how long these games were..  but i was actually shocked because i remembered those games and i was trying in them...  I think that riot should look at how quickly you die to take into account a ban... for example they see a point where u die at 5 mins and 5:35 u are dead again, i would think that's a good sign of inting.. along with a few other aspects we have now to result in a quicker ban. \n\nGetting banned for verbal abuse imo is pretty good the way it is... works a lot better than when people troll in game that's for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sqwishy","date":"2018-03-11T23:01:44.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi :)\n\nDidn't know they removed ban weighting, do you have a link?\n\n> Muting is interesting.

Being a mean person isn't illegal and that's because the way people interpret words is subjective and you can't enforce laws on subjective experiences. Kind of off topic but this is lately a bigger and bigger push by the world and it's not really a good thing... The only time words count as harassment is when the intent is to make you feel bad AND you're unable to avoid it. In leagues, you always have the ability to mute so it shouldn't ever count. Being an ass is bad yes, but everyone on the planet has been an asshole at some point in some context.\n\nImo longer and longer chat restrictions would be better, I do say this though assuming that flamers who play chat restricted games have a better time - it'd actually be very interesting if Riot has done a study on this. My bet would be their win-rate is higher and a lower number of reports/game on average and at the end of the day, that's all anyone wants right? Haha. Eventually, they might realise they win more since they can't talk at which point actual reform can happen.\n\n> \n> I have heard quite a few people say that in bronze-gold is pretty much the same but with slightly increasing mechanics, plat is where a little bit of macro comes in and that the jump from D4/5 to D3+ is bigger than the jump from bronze to plat.\n> It's basically the nature of the server.

Your MMR has to be decent to begin with, otherwise it can and will take a while for it to get to that point. \n\nWinning 10 games as a fluke via luck = 1 in 1024, so you'd have to play 10,000 games to get a 10 streak purely through luck surely that beats the threshold of probability based suppression. I've skipped divisions before but because the system is so slow the odds of getting flamers/trolls/AFKers is so high that it's very hard to show someone deserves their MMR to keep rocketting purely based on winrate - which is why there needs to be an element of performance if not for LP then for MMR momentum.\n\n> It's better to keep the climb slow and steady though, or you will find things similar to what happened after ardent last season.

It also allows smurfs to easily rise back to a suitable rank for them, after all, if you know how to climb it isn't that hard. \n\nYou unwittingly gave me the perfect case example. Imagine for a second how many games were unnecessarily ruined because people were playing a strong meta - those people who climbed in the \"ardent boom\" would have won 100s of games each to get there which means 1000s (100s x 9 peoples games) were won because of a meta change rather than skill. AND THEN after removed another 1000s+ peoples games were ruined as they fell back down. Instead of ACTUALLY moving them where they belong faster because the reality is during that patch they WERE better at the game and deserved to be higher. This is exactly my point, it's so slow that 1000s of peoples games are ruined in the process of moving 1 person from plat back down to gold... And that's completely mental.\n\n> People have suggested getting LP based on the game grading system time and time again, but thats pretty flawed.

If it worked like that it would thin out people who actually haven't learn their lesson, and others who have been negative/minorly abusive in games and not necessarily abusive toxic (ie. homophobic, sexist, telling you to \"kys\" with sincerity, etc.). Also something riot should look into is having a severity reduction for games where people who have trolled in your game (especially if they target you) and you have become abusive towards them. The penalty should be declined or the escalation tier refreshed. If the other person broke the summoner code first, and you abuse them, i feel like while that is not right and never should be allowed, the troller has incited this behavior, it's not like you set out that game to fully abuse someone without any reason. The fact riot wants to focus on people solely and not include a shred of context into evaluating chat abuse/negativity is beyond my comprehension and is crystal clear the biggest fault in their chat report system. I'm assuming riot treats chat like real life, what you wouldn't say in person, shouldn't be typed, and that is all fair and all good. However in real life if you had some guy following you around, annoying you, making whatever your trying to do a living hell, are you seriously telling me you wouldn't abuse that person? Tell them to F*** off? It has nothing to do about having a clear and calm mind when this person is intentionally trying to make your day and moment a disaster.{{sticker:darius-angry}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-11T09:28:30.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"X has muted you\"\n\nI really like that idea.

There's 3 types of players in leagues - 1) /muteall 2) hardcore flamers 3) Calmers who try to relax everyone. \n\nThere are also those who react to hardcore flamers by giving them a good taste of logic. Which is quite ironic because then the other players think that those players are flamers also. When i play the game, i don't gaf about making friends or meming or talking about stuff thats irrelevant to the game, i'm only interested in the skill aspect and winning the game. So when idiots flame me with unwarranted criticism, i give them a good dose of logic back. I don't flame back, but I also don't take kindly to rubbish by lying down and dying. I'm also not going to go out of my way to suck up to people and be a psychologist calming people down. I would have to charge for that. If there are too many idiots in the team, then i do /muteall.\n\nI really liked your post, it described the ranked system very well. Bronze-Diamond 4/5 is not much or a change in skill level, most players still have very weak macro understanding+emotional control and they just have slightly better mechanics the further up you go. It's the result of having a small playerbase and a very easy to learn culture from that playerbase. Only the really best players on the server actually understand the game at a high level (e.g. Dire Wolves players).","replies":[]}]}
