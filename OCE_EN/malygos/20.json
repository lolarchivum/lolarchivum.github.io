I hadn&rsquo;t seen their source yet, but today the sayer had grown bold; in the slums of Noxus, the bold either prevailed or bled out soon after.\nPa yanked me by the scruff of my shirt, with a sigh I rolled out of the nest of blankets that marked our home and slipped the lock on our door for him. Well, to say it was a lock was a bit much. A rusted rod of iron I had to carve a hole through paving just to stop the reinforced wood we used as a door from being forced wasn&rsquo;t much of a lock&hellip; but it did the trick. Pa only had three fingers left these days, his last thumb taxed for another year&rsquo;s lease on peace just two months ago. He&rsquo;d given a lot for me&mdash;same to Ma, may her soul rest well in the endless beyond.\nSee, we walked a dicey line. Through a convoluted network of cutthroats, Pa had indebted himself to a Demacian spy&mdash;we were promised freedom from this forsaken city, and with all the fiery spirit my old man had left, I knew he&rsquo;d risk it all for us; for me. But there was an expectation set upon us by this arrangement: information. Any political unrest, be it trivial or otherwise was due to the only ear that&rsquo;d listen openly; my fear was in the countless other ears which were pressed against the shadows, waiting for our pulse to be heard.\nHeading out like this always played with my heart in terrible ways&mdash;guilt stained what remained of Pa&rsquo;s hands&hellip; I was an innocent likely to get caught as collateral if anything happened. But to let my uneasiness show would find me a grave sooner than revealing the secret Pa carried; I&rsquo;d been mugged for less than a slight frown—a slip in concentration.\nBrave-faced but cautious, we threaded out onto the street and mingled with the dreary crowd&mdash;a sayer out at midday, to say they were bold was an understatement. Usually there weren&rsquo;t this many around and everyone was heading towards the gallows; a fitting place as any for a sayer&rsquo;s nonsense. We tracked our way down the dusty cobbles, ducked through a rotting building and stumbled into the square. A meagre sum of about thirty stood around the wooden platform&mdash;a gathering that large was almost as rare as a procession. Those used to happen often enough&hellip; but then General Du Couteau went missing. \nThe sayers took up residence soon after.\n\nI stared down the man atop the gallows, he was old and knobby like a dying willow. Clothed in robes that dispersed darkness, I could&rsquo;ve placed his loyalty immediately; a black rose threaded across his heart confirmed it. I sighed&mdash;the Black Rose sayers always bored me. They spewed nonsense in vain hope someone possessed the brains to dismantle it, Pa stepped me through a sentence of theirs once; sheer jumps of logic and reason only a genius could make were required to distill any meaning and mixed all throughout were puzzles a child could solve&mdash;every third word or obvious synonyms, the combination of the two was beyond ridiculous. Needless to say, it was well beyond my mental ability&mdash;but props to the few who&rsquo;d cracked it. I doubt a life alongside the Black Rose was enjoyable, but it probably trumped the hopelessness of the slums.\n&ldquo;&hellip;from Zaun to Bandle the raven stirs unrest&mdash;cast off the shackles of prior power and see how the world shifts under the glory of those poised to take it by the throat,&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s voice rung out across the crowd in a deafening boom. I shivered as his magic skittered across my skin, it toyed with my mind and drew me to listen. I calmed my breathing&mdash;I focused entirely on my mother&rsquo;s smile and forced myself to remain present in the moment. By my side, Pa did the same. Both feet planted firmly on the ground, our thoughts lay unperverted. &ldquo;Drained by roots far below the soil, watch our reign feast and grow. Couteau is gone and Darkwill nothing more than a ghost. Weak. Disgusti&mdash;&ldquo;\nA collective gasp burst out of the crowd as the sayer&rsquo;s magic fizzled. \nA silver shard of metal punched through his breast&mdash;it cut the stem of the rose, the bulbous flower unravelled as it fell towards the floor.\nFor an instant, I saw it. A silhouette&mdash;a man hidden under a purple cowl, his face gaunt as shadows melted away. His expression bore no emotion, the blade vanished&mdash;the figure vanished, consumed by a brief twist of his cloak. It fanned across his body, each strip of crimson was tipped by another deadly blade&mdash;wrapped well in his garment, the assassin was simply no more; gone. \nIt all happened so suddenly&mdash;the severed head of the black rose had hardly fallen an inch, it distorted, the shape of it blurred as it ruptured into a small cloud of iridescent smoke.\nBefore my pent up breath could be freed, a raven cawed as it took to the grey skies&mdash;headed for the centre of the city; from this distance, I could still see the hatred glowing red in its eyes. \n\nPa shoved me back&mdash;before I could even steady myself, we were running from the square. If we stayed ahead of the crowds, chances were we&rsquo;d be able to rush home alive.\nThe implication of what had happened went far over my head&mdash;I glanced back at the gallows, a woman and her son were already robbing the sayer as he writhed on the ground, clutching at his heart. Poor fellow wasn&rsquo;t even dead yet&hellip; I would&rsquo;ve done the same.\nI drove the iron rod home as we panted, safe in our alcove. Pa kicked the corner of our blankets up to reveal a pencil and some paper&mdash;clutching the wood between his three fingers, with his elbow to steady the sheet, he scribbled what would hopefully be the key to our freedom; somehow I was na&iuml;ve enough to think I could ever be free from the rampant displays of power that fuelled the engine of Noxus&rsquo;s political vying. \nToday was hardly different to any other day&mdash;within a week, there&rsquo;d be a new sayer and within a week of that, there&rsquo;d be another murder. Hopefully of Couteau&rsquo;s court&mdash;though the General was gone, his allies always put on a show, like they had today: a kill out in the open. I shrugged away my shock, it was a dangerous emotion to keep for long. \nAs much as I hoped it mattered, I really doubted this meant anything&hellip; even to the Demacian; he&rsquo;d thank Pa, of course&mdash;then he&rsquo;d do as Demacians often did with promises: mince them. \n\nReally, there was no solace in hoping on refracted silence.","replies":[{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T05:07:27.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of the bystander, and the voice here, and because of that, the flowing nature of the descriptions and events.

Definitely agree with you on the ellipses, I wanted the narrator to seem to have a mildly sluggish stream of consciousness, offset by his need to keep focused on things that happened (hence the frequent em dashes) but I didn't hit the balance I wanted with it and didn't really edit like I should've. \n\nNext time, I'll definitely spend more time formatting :)","replies":[{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T23:24:09.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear you, the formatting was really hard to do for my piece on the boards.
