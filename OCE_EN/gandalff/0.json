{"poster":"Gandalff","date":"2016-04-09T13:02:55.919+0000","title":"So long league","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys im Gandalff, \r\n\r\nI just wanted to express a few of my thoughts about league, as I have decided to give it up. \r\n\r\nFirstly, let me say that I have played this game since season 2 and since my first game almost 5 years ago, league has been my favourite game. It was an awesome game that I started playing solo, and I just couldn&#039;t get enough of it. Through league I got to know some acquaintances a hell of a lot better, and to this day they are some of my closest friends. Back then, Riot did an amazing job of catering to its player base. Every patch seemed meaningful and everything that changed just made the game so much more fun. However, as the game has become more successful I feel like Riot has really lost touch with its player base, particularly here in oce. \r\n\r\nOne thing I really want to draw attention to is balance. The amount of time it take for champions to be properly balanced after large patches is just ridiculous, and that is to say if they get balanced at all. For example, this season lux, ahri, jax, yi, brand, kindred and tahm kench. These champions just show up entirely too often, It really just makes for boring game play.  I know that you can build to counter these characters, and I do it frequently. But instead of making more champions strong enough to slot into the meta or taking away some of the power from inherently op champs, weak champions are getting reworks that change everything about their play style, which would be fair enough if riot didn&#039;t refuse to give money back on skins after a rework. It is just so crappy when you spend money on characters because you enjoyed playing them, just to have them ripped out of your hands and replaced with something you never wanted. I do appreciate that champs are getting balanced in the patches, but I feel like the balance changes are all aimed at high elo play, instead of at bronze - gold where the vast majority of the playing population is.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that has disappointed me this season is the new champion select. Firstly, I am a silver and it can take 10 minutes or more to find a match (which seem to be lasting only about 20 minutes), I just don&#039;t believe that the oce population is big enough for this type of champ select. For me it is just the last straw in a string of small neglects the oce server has dished out to us. Firstly it has taken years for us to get game modes that every other server has, but hey we have better ping here and most people only play SR plus it is a free game anyway (I might add that we still do not have full access to these modes.). So game modes aside I enjoyed the oce server for some time, until it was announced that after years of waiting we would have to pay for our server skin. Yes, profits are going to charity that is nice and all, but EVERY OTHER SERVER got theirs for FREE, some even got multiple skins. Money aside, cosmic reaver kassadin? really? Cool you had a warden kassadin skin lying around and threw some star particles at it and slightly changed the colour. To be frank it seriously doesn&#039;t represent our region at all and we are told that it is the result of years of consideration. (though I didn&#039;t but the skin I donated 20 bucks to the cancer foundation instead to avoid people putting me on a guilt trip for being mad about the skin). \r\n\r\nIn summary I just feel that since riot was bought out by tencent, the game has been more about making money than keeping the game fun, with the addition of champion mastery and skin crafting it just seems like casino like gimics are being thrown at us to keep players involved and invested. I believe im slightly vindicated in this feeling since I read earlier tonight that riot games would be earning a projected 17 billion dollars this year. \r\n\r\nTo end a slightly morbid rant on a positive note, I have really enjoyed my time playing league of legends and hope that other people can continue to play it with as much passion as I have in the past. I also want to thank riot employees, who are usually pretty awesome at answering questions and are generally pretty friendly when you come across them in game.\r\n\r\nTLDR\r\n\r\nI love league, but hate waiting 10+ minutes to play a 20 minute game against the same 15 champions.\r\nI also hate being ignored as an oce player, and cant help but feel riot is all about the money now.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-09T13:05:46.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"in the immortal words of riot \"Fuck the casual playerbase, we are the pros bitches\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-15T15:14:05.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues you listed is pretty true and repeated often however it's important to remember the majority of the community doesn't always play champions like Ahri and Lux because they are op. Some champions just appeal to people more than others. It would bring people more fun to blow shit up with lux or brand and dash around and assassinate people with ahri or zed rather than just kite and tickle things with someone like Karma. At the end of the day, it comes down to what the community wants to play which decides the meta, and that's not something Riot can really change unless they want to completely gutter a champion, which they have gotten alot better at not doing.\n\nI also don't totally agree with your whole rework thing. Every champion that has been reworked recently wasn't just because they were 'weak', it's because they were completely outdated. Sure they give an entirely different perspective of the champion, which is the one thing I don't like about reworks, however champions that recieved reworks didnt exactly have unique gameplay to begin with, which the reworks provides, which riot tries to avoid to make the game more interesting.\n\nI totally get the whole catering the player base thing that happened in season 2, and I will admit that I feel that pros seem like more of a priority, but it's not like Riot doesn't completely care about us. The champion select was made so people actually had a chance to play their best roles for ranked rather than being left with an unfavoured role just because they didnt type it in chat long enough, not to mention this solved toxic issues like instalocking. I understand that having to wait 10 minutes can suck but cut riot some slack, theres not much that can be done to completely eliminate all aspects of the champion select situation, and either way your going to have angry people. Riot just decided to take the more obvious choice here.\n\nalso\n> with the addition of champion mastery and skin crafting it just seems like casino like gimics are being thrown at us to keep players involved and invested.\n\nhow on earth is this a bad thing ? So what they are trying to keep us involved. It's not like they are scamming us or anything lol. Riot doesn't exactly owe us anything, so we should at least be grateful that they are giving us all this free stuff rather than just throwing a bunch of deals in our faces. It's fine to be mad about the whole kassadin skin thing, which didnt make much sense to me, but how is not getting a skin a contributing factor to you completely quitting the game ?? cmon man.\n\nTLDR; You have every right to quit the game if you dont feel satisfied with it, but you need to try and be a bit more open minded about these things before you start throwing out accusations like that at Riot, because it seems to me that to you every attempt of theirs to make this game more interesting and fair has been mistaken as another scheme to take all our money and neglect our feelings...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-10T01:15:23.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"well i think everything is balanced as of right now. besides kindred and poppy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-09T15:09:20.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay so first of all, why is balancing around high elo wrong?\nIT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PLAYER BASE IS LOW ELO.\n\nNEVER. NEVER balance around the lowest skill level, why? Because it completely ruins a game.\nIf you balance around the highest skill level play of your game, nothing will be OP.\nNo. Those champs you listed aren't overpowered, hell you've never seen overpowered if you're only just complaining about Jax now when you came in from Season 2.\nThose champs are just popular. People LOVE Ahri, people love Lux (Star Guardian Lux REPRESENT!). It used to be that all you'd see is the Swag Lord Twisted Fate. It's a phase, the new face of League will happen.\n\nAlso complaining about the meta. Why?\nYou're the reason the meta exists. Riot have ZERO impact on it, the players, the community is what control the meta.\nSure a buff or nerf here or there may change a champion's popularity somewhat in the meta, but Riot have no direct control over it, and telling them to fix it wont do anything.\nTHE PLAYERS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CONTROL THE META. You have a problem with it, you change it.\n\nReworks are good, I've yet to see a single rework where they've ruined how a champion or skin previously looked.\nIt's especially confusing for you to be talking about this now when Taric is being reworked.\nIf you at all think Taric looks good now and that it's a problem he is being visually updated and looks worse because of that. There is something absolutely wrong with you.\nI've been a long time fan of Taric, he's one of my all time favourite champions and my first thought whenever I decide to go top lane, I'm balls to the wall excited for his rework, and he looks amazing.\nShow me a rework that ruined a champion/skin. There are none that did that.\nSion, Poppy, Garen, Gangplank and Karthus look far better than they ever have.\n\nEnd of the day, Riot is a company.\nWhat do companies exist to do? MAKE MONEY.\nThat's all they do.\nThat's all they have to do.\nThat's all investors want them to do.\nMAKE MONEY.\nSo they have to come up with new ways to keep the players interested in the game so they keep spending money on the game.\nTencent have nothing to do with this, well okay, they probably put more pressure onto Riot to make more money. But the only influence I've seen from Tencent is that they make sure the game fits China's cultural acceptance, meaning Graves can't have a cigar, Karthus can't have any bones showing, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-15T15:21:14.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> THE PLAYERS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CONTROL THE META.
