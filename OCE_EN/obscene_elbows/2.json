I was just wondering how long it took you to be able to do ok (even if not great) in most games, such as usually having a positive KDA. I&#039;m new to league and have been playing for the past month,  recently breaking an 8-loss streak and realizing that my lifetime kdr is 0.5 with my win rate being just under 40%ish.\r\n\r\nI realize that this is a very subjective question and will change from person to person but i am still interested in hearing your opinions.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-23T04:36:30.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing since the end of season 2, my best champ is Azir, i occasionally get a score like 22/6/8 on him and occasionally get 1/7/9.\n\nconsistency only exists in a measurable way without external factors, for example I'm an archer in real life you can train your body and mind to make each shot as similar as you can to the last, and consistency is measured by how close together a grouping of arrows is on the target (regardless of whether it was on the centre or not) but you can only do that when the target is still, the bow is the same bow and the arrows are the same arrows, and the weather is the same. Its only you that you need to train, however in Lol so many factors are variable, you could vs your champions biggest counter and smash them because they sucked, or you could counter pick you enemy and still be smashed because they were better than you. When your enemy is changing, you cant ever be properly consistent, if you were an archer and had to hit a target that randomly moved all over the place with a different bow each time using different arrows, a good archer may be able to hit the target every time, but your arrows would be all over the place, certainly not a consistent little group like when the target was still. \n\nif there are changing factors The enemy (the target) your champion (the bow) your items (the arrows) the weather (the allied/enemy champs)\n\ni know a LOT of world championship archers, one has been world champion in the most advanced division 5 times, he could shoot an apple off my head at 50 meters and i would only be slightly terrified. But none of them, not even him could have a consistent group on a changing target taking every shot with a different bow and a different arrow, and thats what lol is.\n\nSo don't expect to be too consistent in Lol, unless you play the same position with the same champ and same items against the same enemy champs played by the same people, every time, you cant expect any proper 'measurable' consistently. \n\nrather than being consistent, the best thing you can do is learn how to act consistently in certain situations, because even though the champs and players may change, there will always be certain situations that happen for example:\nHow to play when your team is way ahead\nHow to play when your team is way behind \nHow to play when the enemy team have a fed as fuck player\nHow to play when your team has a fed as fuck player\nHow to play when the game is even \nHow to play when your team has no vision\nHow to play when your team has lots of vision \nHow to play when your team always loses team fights \nHow to play against a CC heavy team\nthe list goes on and on, but those situations (among many more) will happen time and time again, sometimes it will be Zed thats fed and other times it will be Vayne, but as long as you know how to play in situations where someone is fed then you will stand a better chance at overcoming it. It wont be a consistent situation (a fed vayne with a kayle supp will be different to a fed vayne with a blitz support), but you will know how to act constantly. if that makes and sense.\n\nBuy my highest rank is only S4 so I'm not exactly the most knowledgable.","replies":[{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2016-04-23T04:46:57.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said, an interesting read. However a good archer should be able to hit a target no matter what bow or arrows used (so long as they are good quality) the grouping may be not as good sometimes but the target would be hit. A novice archer may not be able to hit the target at all sometimes and will sometimes shoot quite well which was my experience with archery, one day i shot so accurately that i damaged one of my arrows by hitting it with another and the next day my grouping was awful.\n\nMy goal is to be able to play the majority of my games and look back whether i win or lose and know that i did ok and wasnt the cause of the loss or contributed to the win.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-23T07:03:37.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bows in archery are so different that a lot of people can use one but not the other, the hardest bow to use (apart from non-meta historical bows like the Japanese Yumi, etc) is generally considered to be the longbow. With no tech its much harder to perform the same shot repeatedly and any small mistake is amplified, also wooden arrows (that the longbow uses) are naturally less straight and heavier than carbon ones so they shoot a lot differently that the scoped compound bows with carbon arrows, a lot of compound shooters would struggle with a longbow, just like a lot of purely longbow shooters would struggle with a compound. \n\nIronically however a longbow because it has no sights is actually easier to hit a moving target, because the mind instinctively knows what to do and sights just get in the way, plus they are faster to shoot. \n\nNot all archers (even the good ones) can hit a moving target 100% of the time and certainly not with every bow, even something as slight as changing the weight of the arrows even on the same bow will put a lot of archers off, and anyone with sights will be screwed if that happens as they will need to re-ajust their whole sight settings which takes hours. A recurve/longbow will adjust much easier to arrow weight/size changes, but certainly not enough to be dead accurate on the first shot or two, as they rely heavily on the feel of the bow rather than the tech of aiming it. \n\nA good compound bow user with a scope should hit the (non moving) target every time, and he will be disappointed if he doesn't hit the bullseye, a good longbow archer will be overjoyed just to not miss most of the targets, and have been known to do victory dances when the they hit the bullseye in succession. (which is why i shoot longbow, its just more of a fun attitude, but I'm not very good) So they definitely wouldn't hit the target all of the time even though some of them are a lot better than compound shooters who hit the targets more times, the difference is equipment is huge. \n\nWhen you damage your arrows by hitting it with another one, is called a 'robin hood' because of the legend that he could split an arrow down the middle with another (which i have seen a few times before, although not the whole way down like in the legend) so congrats on doing that! it means you shot very very consistently. \n\nIn terms of lol, just first focus on not feeding, learning how to play round an already quite fed lane opponent without feeding them more is a valuable skill that surprisingly few people know how to do. For now just put in all your effort into playing safe and doing that, and the rest will come naturally over time :)\n\nGood post btw!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2016-04-23T04:52:13.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the Replies :) they have definitely given me something to think about i just don't want to be the reason my team loses and have 1/10/8 type games (which i have done occasionally).
