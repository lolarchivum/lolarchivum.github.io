You shouldn't have to write off 60% of the champions just because they can't build tank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-07T21:12:04.431+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am wildy against the amount of damage in this game, _(honestly there needs to be a 20% damage reduction across the whole board)_.\nAnd for the most part, I disagree with 1-shotting, its nearly impossible to 'counterplay' when Draven flashes out of the fog of war and removes you from this world, before you have time to understand what is happening.\n\nHowever there are some _(very few, but some)_ instances where 1-shotting is acceptable imo.\n\nZoe is one. Unlike champs like Draven and Jarvan, Zoe's entire kit is built around 1-shotting. This means that unlike the other two, either she 1-shots you and you die, or she cant 1-shot you, and she's useless. Her combo requires a lot of setup and is easily countered. Her sleepy trouble bubble gives you enough time to get behind minions or activate any defences you have, e.g. spellshiled/Zhonyas/Self-buff etc. And all parts of her combo have enough clear warning about what she's about to do and where it will be coming from.\n\nSecond is Veigar. Veigar's whole identity is 'that terrifying little shit that pops you.' remove his 1-shot ability and it removes all he is, you cant have an infinitely scaling mage, and expect him not to be able to 1-hit things later in the game. What is balanced about Veigar is that he can 1-shot you, but unlike Draven/Rengo etc. he can do it easily ONCE. After his ult is gone he has to hit his W for any meaningful damage, and its hard for him to do that without his E, and that is both hard to hit and has a lengthy cooldown, so after he has 1-shot you, his damage has a lot of counterplay, meaning your team can easily dispatch him. He cant just jump into a 1v4 and burst down everyone.\n\nThis one I say with a little more reluctance:  Jhin's 4th shot shouldn't be a 1-shot, but it should have enough damage to feel like one.\nIf it was up to me, id make Jhin's basic attacks unable to crit, and any crit chance he has increases the damage of his 4th shot. As it stands now, the 4th shot is definitely stronger, but not enough to truly deter many attackers. It should be that when he has his 4th shot up, even shit like Zed is afraid to go in on him. However this also means that his regular attacks are less powerful, to balance it out. After all, he is more of a burst ADC than a sustained one. And he has to get through his first 3 shots before he has access to his 4th, so its not like he can just press a button and suddenly have it available, which gives champs time to either kill him, or get the fuck out.\n\n________________________\n\nThose are the instances off the top of my head, where 1-shotting is appropriate.\nRengar leaping out of nowhere and putting you through the blender? **NO.**\nDraven killing your entire team with 6 auto attacks? **NO.**\nJarvan pressing R? **NO.**\nKat shunpo/ult to you _(and you dying in the first 0.2 seconds of her ult)_? **NO.**\n\n\nAssassins should be able to 100-0 squishy champs pretty much at any time. However they should have to land **all** their kit in order to do so, _(the number of times I've managed to avoid all Zed's shurikens and still been melted, is ridiculous)_.\n\nSustained damage champs _(with the exception of Jhin's 4th shot as mentioned above)_, should never, under any circumstances, ever be able to 1-shot you.\nAzir/Cassiopeia/Ashe/Vayne/Aurelion Sol/Jax/Kindred/Kog/Nasus/Darius etc etc. their damage is 'sustained' which by definition means they should have to be attacking you for a while in order to kill you.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-08T07:41:00.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what's your opinion on shaco? \nRealistically if a shaco decides to q in and auto you, he's in for the long and short, and if you don't get bursted, likely he will, clone buys a split second, but it certainly isn't a get out of jail free card, and realistically since the clone takes extra damage and shaco is squishy, you'll likely both die in 3 hits anyway, if you try to ult from point blank and escape (not to say ult isn't an amazing utility tool, but it's not an escape).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-08T09:19:44.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he's good, but my main issue with Shaco is the classification of his invisibility.\nHaving him not shown up by red wards makes his ganks insanely strong, and more often than not, he can use his invis a second time, defensively, during the fight to escape, or confuse the target.\n\nI think, his invis should count as 'invisible' when not in combat, but when he is in combat _(within X seconds of dealing/taking damage etc)_ his Q should count as 'camouflage' instead. Allowing him to be seen by red wards and other similar revealing abilities.\n\nThis keeps his ganking potential insanely good, but lets his opponents counterplay his defensive capability during fights.\n\n______________\n\n\nApart from that, Shaco seems relatively balanced to me, he comes in, assassinates a target, causes a little havoc with his ult and traps, and escapes in the confusion. Just what an assassin ought to do.\n\nHe deals a bit too much sustained damage _(considering his high burst)_ for my liking, especially with his crits and ult, but unlike other assassins like Zed or Fizz, he remains very squishy all through the game, so it balances out quite evenly.\n\nOverall, I think he is one of the assassins that portrays the role of 'assassin' very accurately, much like Kassadin, Talon and LB.\nLess of the tanker jump-in-and-wreak-havoc-with-my-AoE-then-pick-off-the-survivors 'fighter-assassins' such as Yasuo/Zed/Fizz/Ekko etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-08T13:30:38.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shaco's q is a fairly long cd, so it really is only either engage or disengage, you can't use it for both. It's really not something you can use twice in a fight. It isn't like a khazix jump, 16s-14s is a considerable cooldown even with the 2.5s refund isn't an escape plan, shaco q will get you in, but your escape plan generally relies on your team. \n\nI don't agree with your statement of shaco can q in, assassinate someone, and then q out, using q twice in a short fight. Escaping (if at all) once you've failed to assassinate someone for a shaco is generally alot less dignified than you're making it seem because q will be on cooldown, and so you've just got to hope you can walk out.\n\nAlso for me shaco embodies a strong ideal of feast or famine. With very subpar base damages and no natural damage steroids or sustain, if shaco falls behind, he really falls behind, however the strength of his gank potential can also make him very very dangerous when ahead, and really difficult to play around. I feel assassins should be the threat of a snowball, but also the risk of falling behind, and have poor scaling into lategame, but a good midgame.\n\nAlso he doesn't have any more consistent damage than any other assassin, as shaco has no damage steroids, his e has about the same damage as Khazix W, and 130% extra damage crit (not a real crit, does less damage than kha passive) on his first backstab, isn't exactly high dps. Overall Shaco's main power comes from being ahead of the item curve.\n\nAlso boxes are hard to pull off, planning where to box to create an opening and where to box to make an exit is very hard and can fall apart if you can't predict enemies.\n\nI know you hate assassins, but I feel you're biased sometimes. Shaco is a game balance issue because he has unhealthy mechanics, if it wasn't for the fact that his abilities do inherently unfair things around his gameplay style, or how his boxes allow him to setup unfair scenarios, statwise he's got some of the worst scaling and dps out of any assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-08T23:07:38.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not quite sure what you want, you asked my what my opinion on Shaco was.\nthe vast majority of it was:\n\n> I think he's good. - Shaco seems relatively balanced to me. - Just what an assassin ought to do. - Overall, I think he is one of the assassins that portrays the role of 'assassin' very accurately. - He remains very squishy all through the game, so it balances out quite evenly. - Less of the tanker jump-in-and-wreak-havoc-with-my-AoE-then-pick-off-the-survivors 'fighter-assassins' such as Yasuo/Zed/Fizz/Ekko etc.\n\nThats about as good a praise from me that any assassin has ever had. And you're still calling me bias?\n\nI don't hate assassins at all. I hate when assassins do multiple jobs _(Vayne being a marksman AND an assassin, or Yasuo being a fighter AND an assassin, or Lee being a tank AND an assassin.)_ because by definition if an assassin is capable of doing another job, then it completely counteracts the weaknesses a true assassin should have.\n\nI have 1 issue with shaco, thats him being able to escape with his invis. _(I probably have more issues with Azir's kit than I do with Shaco's)_. With CDR it has a 5.2 second cooldown. That is easily enough to use it twice in a fight. Thats less time than Zoe's trouble bubble, and we all know how many times she can use that in a fight.\n\nWith the CC from his traps, and the confusion of his ult, Shaco can easily live long enough to use his invis to escape. In fact It happened several times the last game I played against him. Thats just fact, you can argue it as much as you want, but I see it happen.\n\nMany Shacos build crit _(Shiv/IE etc)_, and anyone with AD and crit, has sustained damage! \nBut like I said, Shaco's sustained damage isn't a huge worry because he is so squishy.\n\n________________\n\nI disagree that assassins should be feast or famine.\n\nBy stating that assassins are balanced if they are feast or famine champs, the balance team is essentially saying _\"Its fair if they become unstoppable if they get early kills.\"_ About the class whose entire kit revolves around making it easy to get early kills...\n\nThe problem with being feast or famine is that in order to actually be worth anything in a game, an assassin will always need to be able to kill squishies, even when behind. _(Riot has even said as much, that they will always keep assassins capable of doing their job, even when behind)_\nTherefore if they can always kill their target even when in 'famine', all being in 'feast' does, is make them able to kill even more people (which then makes them not an _'assassin'_ anymore).\n\nI think that assassins should always be able to kill squishes no matter how far ahead/behind, but they should always have large periods of weakness afterwards.\nWhich is why I think assassins like Kassadin, Talon and LB are very balanced, they can devastate squishies very quickly, but after they have done so, they have to wait a significant period of time before being able to do anything else. and THATS the risk assassins should have to take.\n\nThey pick 1 **(ONE)** target, and obliterate them, then the fight basically becomes a 4v4. So the advantage of the assassin is that you make the fight a 4v4 but you get to choose which 1 of the enemy team isn't in the fight. Most assassins these days obliterate a target and still have enough in their kit to make the battle a meaningful 4v5.\n\n____________\n\nThink about how assassins function in real life. They go in, take out a high profile target and then either get caught and executed, or disappear into the night. Allowing the rest of the army to come in and defeat the leaderless enemy force.\nThe assassin doesn't come back wth the army smoking a cigar and duel wielding miniguns. They are sitting either in some seaside resort counting their prize money, or in a shallow Taliban grave in the desert. Either way they have done their job.  Why should league assassins be any different?\n\nIve said I think Shaco does this well, I think he's balanced when you consider the job he is supposed to do, especially when compared with other assassins, Isn't that enough?","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-03-09T00:06:04.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=TEbMtRqu,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-08T23:07:38.304+0000)\n>\n> The assassin doesn&#x27;t come back wth the army smoking a cigar and duel wielding miniguns. \n\nLmao, sounds like an 80's Schwarzenegger film.\nI guess that was the point.\n\nI agree that all damage needs to be reduced, it's just too easy to 100-0, with no counterplay, in this current meta.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-03-08T19:27:14.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also aiming this at say Akali 0 skill shots all point and click massive healing from nowhere and takes 0 effort to kill someone same with talon much like rengar has a point and click q and does unnecessarily insane  amounts damage , both Yasuo and Akali have needed a massive nerf for a long time but riot just doesn't seem to get it. in my opinion, i just don't think they understand the word balance anymore if they took a closer look at Yasuo as a champ and how Akali kills people with such little effort I still don't think they would see whats wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-08T22:28:13.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali is confirmed for a full rework.\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/01/champion-roadmap-january-2018/\n\nRiot announced that they would also give Yasuo a kindred-scale rework to make him less of a c*nt champ so he wouldn't be permabanned. \nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/06/ask-riot-yasuo-gets-banned/\n\nHowever this was announced the same time Azir's rework was, that has since come and gone, and we haven't heard a peep about Yasuo. _(so my hopes aren't high)_","replies":[{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-03-09T15:51:13.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you, ill read through this. i just hope when they dod do this they take whatever he is now and throw it in the trash because right now his kit is busted and its never been changed plus they gave him a buff last yeah he did not need in the slightest","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2018-03-08T06:34:12.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Papa Sesshomaru, I have a confession to make.\nRecently, I have been doing so badly that i have resorted to playing crit zed.
