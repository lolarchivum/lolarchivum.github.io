For this contest we'll offer winners the choice of RP or the tablet, and I'll take a look at cooler prizing options for future!","replies":[{"poster":"TheBioB","date":"2018-01-06T07:11:56.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I THINK THE PRIZE IS SO EXCITING!

BUT WITH SAND PILES ON TOP OF THEIR HEADS AND LITTLE FLOATIES ON THEIR LITTLE ARMIES!!!!!!!!! (pentakill yoricks walkers have spiked arm bands)\n\nIm sure someone with artistic talent could make this happen, I'd also be keen to see if a rioter atleast likes the idea? :D\n\nanyways, good hunting!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bamfudge","date":"2018-01-09T05:27:06.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds hilarious!
