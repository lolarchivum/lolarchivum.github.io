I, along with my clones, also appear in segments on the OPL and are plotting World Domination.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Belquin**\n\nAs the Esports Lead, I&rsquo;m responsible for overseeing the creation of Oceanic LoL esports from grass roots through to Pro.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Perigan**\n\nI&rsquo;m the Head of Esport Audience Engagement, responsible for the strategy and execution of local esports content for our publishing (e.g oce.lolesports.com &amp; social media) and broadcast (the OPL stream).\nI&rsquo;m also still leading the OCE broadcast efforts from our Sydney studio and live events like Rift Rivals, OPL finals, and League of Origin.\n\nDisgusting Sona One-Trick ;)\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Conquisitor**\n\nAs the lead for Community and Social Play, I try to find meaningful ways to bring players together to foster friendly and sportsmanlike communities. My work allows me to work across gaming and non-gaming communities in Oceania.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**CptStupendous**\n\nAs Country Manager, my role has two main components. Firstly I am responsible for building teams and making sure those teams are able to go out and do their very best work for the player. Next to team facilitation is product strategy. I interpret global strategy and translate that to our local operations designed to be specifically created for the Oceanic players.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThere will be two more groups of OCE Rioters joining us on the Boards Monday and Tuesday of next week (10th and 11th of December).","replies":[{"poster":"Taze","date":"2018-12-05T01:00:03.929+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My question is for Belquin\nAs the Esports Lead, I’m responsible for overseeing the creation of Oceanic LoL esports from grass roots through to Pro.\n\n\nQ1: With OOL being removed, there was an article that came out saying for us to not worry about OOL being removed because ESL, PRO teams etc.. would be holding tournaments to replace that side of the scene. Which didn't seem to really happen in 2018 besides communities running their own. Are there any plans for 2019 for these replacements tournaments happening? \n\nQ2: After seeing how esports works, getting a lot roles seems to be a lot about who you know not always about how good you are.

We did try and work with tournament operators even this year to create some opportunities in lieu of the OOL, but haven't really delivered here. There isn't currently plans to focus on an amateur / OOL level competition, but as I mentioned above to BioPanther Fan - its an area we see great value in fostering and are really keen to work with partners / tournament organisers to fill the gap here. \n\nQ2: This one definitely relates to the first one, in that we see value in this and I'd love to have a robust ecosystem at the amateur level to allow for aspiring teams, coaches, staff etc to gather experience. I guess you could say our focus in the grass roots area has been around High School and University as opposed to the amateur competitive space.\n\nThanks for the questions, It's definitely a space the team will need to put some more thought into.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2018-12-03T10:13:07.250+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"for conquisitor: Now that we no longer have Ocean week (RIP), are there are plans for a similar event like it?

The name and the man),\n\nAwesome questions. Specifically in 2018 we wanted to bring in dedicated Play by Play casters for our three live events (Rift Rivals: HiPrain, MEO: PiraTechnics, LoO: Atlus). Each one of those required a different talent. For Rift Rivals, we wanted to use HiPrain as he has been around the EU scene for a while and is a super talent. His name has been floated around a few times and this was a great opportunity for our audience (live and on stream) to feel the hype around Rift Rivals. For the OPL Final, we wanted to move Spawn to colour casting, which is what he's best at, but needed someone with experience and skill to carry a live final. Quickshot in EU was extremely helpful in helping us secure the services of Pira. For the League of Origin, the AFL actually did all the work booking talent, and they identified Atlus, being an Australian and casting the LCK, as their PBP of choice.\n\nWhat I would say for 2019 is - watch this space.  I don't want to spoil anything here, but I'm really excited for the 2019 OPL broadcast.\n\nNichboy has provided us with out of this world entertainment. The OPL will continue to offer as much interaction and entertainment as it did this year, if not more. The OCS is still being determined as to what it looks like, but what I will say is that I thought Hysterics and TGun were sensational on the OCS this year. Their chemistry was {{sticker:sg-lux}}  and anyone watching in Twitch chat would be hard pressed to disagree. I am yet to see them fight...\n\nThat's good feedback on the analysis - we're still building out the show, but that's a great point to consider.\n\n:-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2018-12-06T02:22:08.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BioPanther Fan,\n\nThanks for the question.
