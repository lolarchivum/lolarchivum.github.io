I keep getting told that if you can&#039;t pull yourself out of silver/gold, I&#039;m trash. Can I ask, how many people actually climb out of ELO hell alone? Like, is it possible to do without a partner? &lt;--- genuinely curious\n\nLook at my match history. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve had a game in which one or more of my teammates haven&#039;t just died and died and died and died.\n\nThis is what happens a lot. Either you get someone - refer to either Morgana from last few games - who just feeds and feeds and feeds and feeds. Like, to the point where I just am lost for words. They die once and the floodgates open and they just die over and over again. If I ADC, I will get a support that does not help me farm if I&#039;m put under turret. I mean, is it not the obvious thing to do? Just give those ranged minions a tap for your ADC. It&#039;s all good.\n\nIf we&#039;re ahead, my team will get carried away and start doing the most ridiculous things. OK, cool, we&#039;re ahead. Let&#039;s systematically dismantle these mofos. Easy Peasy. Then you get a Darius and Kayle who are just constantly going 2v5. Got a Kha&#039;zix that tries to steal dragon 5v1.\n\nTHAT LEADS ME TO ANOTHER THING!!! Why do people desperately try to steal the dragon in the worst situations? I mean, if you steal it, cool. You got dragon and gave a kill. Maybe worth. However, the chances of getting that dragon... come on... risk versus reward people. Risk = 1 or more kills + dragon for enemy team, reward = dragon. No, I&#039;m not talking about Elder Dragon.\n\nAnother thing. Chasing and sight. Um... probably don&#039;t chase a Trundle halfway across the map. If you have map hack and you can see their entire team&#039;s whereabouts, go ahead, but obviously you don&#039;t have map hack. So just back off.\n\nUpgrading trinkets. Holy moly... holy moly... holy moly... why not? Why not? Why do supports run around with a Sightstone and yellow trinket? Why not upgrade? Seriously, why not? That goes for most other roles as well. I can&#039;t bear seeing level 18s run around with yellow trinket. Do you know that you don&#039;t  have to facecheck if you upgrade to blue trinket? Do you know that level 2 red trinket can help your team go places undetected? BY THE WAY - UPGRADING IS FREE! JUST HIT LEVEL 9. LOL!\n\nGiving blue to mid... guys... if the enemy Orianna has blue and your Twisted Fate doesn&#039;t have blue, what happens? Probably bye-bye mid turret. Right? Yes, you could camp her, but why not give Twisted Fate his blue and let him defend turret and keep up in CS? Just give your mid the blue guys. They need it to farm and wave clear. If the enemy mid mage doesn&#039;t receive blue, all good. Your mid mage will have a massive advantage.\n\nTHIS ONE MAKES ME CRINGE! Enemy team goes top lane to gank an overextended [Champion]. Me and the rest of the team are in mid lane or very close to it. Suhweeeeet! Mid turret for us, maybe even more. Someone pings dragon. I beg them, no. Mid turret please. Mid turret then dragon will be easier to get. Let&#039;s do this. Get that gold + map pressure. Team goes to dragon. What can I do but follow them? Their mid turret stands, they get top champion, we get dragon buff. This isn&#039;t risk versus reward, lmao. This is like paying $10.00 for a $5.00 bill.\n\nCS. Holy cow. CS is so low. So, so, so, so low. Incredibly low.\n\nOther minute things include;\n\nDon&#039;t go in AFTER they get baron unless they have been seriously compromised. If you discover them at the end stages of baron and they&#039;re all pretty damn healthy and fighting fit, what&#039;s the point? Is there a point of fighting there? Is there something to defend there after baron goes down?\n\nDefending... that thing. &quot;Dude, what are you defending?&quot; Enemy team is pushing. Teammates engage or get engaged upon away from any objective the enemy team is going for. Um... probably use that turret guys. It&#039;s what we&#039;re defending after all, right?\n\nNot buying pink ward against Vayne and other invisible champs.\n\nNot dropping pink ward when ! pops up for Rengar.\n\nChasing beyond ward lines.\n\nNot warding your lane with a pink if you are top/mid.\n\nBeing kill hungry rather than CS hungry in early stages of game. Unless you have pretty much hard countered the enemy champion, farm first, trade damage when opportunity arises. \n\nWhen &quot;Enemy team has slain dragon&quot; comes up and you&#039;re in the bot lane with no help arriving, probably play a bit cautiously. Even if you&#039;re with your support, if you&#039;re extended somewhat, just a nice little backaroony will do, just until you see their team pop up elsewhere.\n\nSUPPORTS! HELP YOUR ADC FARM. Look at minions. If their minions outnumber your minions, you might want to balance it out so that you&#039;re not put under turret for the first 10 minutes of the game. Yes, some situation, you have absolutely no choice. Sometimes the enemy bot lane will just be may more powerful than you in lane, but otherwise, help your ADC farm, not be put under turret. If you are put under turret, help your ADC farm!!! Most of the time, one auto from you + one turret shot + one ADC auto will get ranged minions. Melee minions will be two turret shots and one ADC auto. However, if any enemy minions have got turret and minion aggro, just have a look and see what needs to be done. It will probably be something like minion damage + one turret + one auto from you allows your ADC to get that minion. Either way, if it&#039;s obvious your ADC won&#039;t get it and you&#039;re not sure if an auto from you will help, just auto it. Better gold going to you and not your ADC than going to zip-nada.\n\nTurrets bounce waves!!! TURRETS BOUNCE WAVES!!!\n\nGuys, no matter how far ahead you are, anything less than a 5v5 is foolhardy. Obviously, if you&#039;re ridiculously ahead, you may be able to pull it off, but that&#039;s not too often the case. You are probably giving shutdown gold and they&#039;re at a point where they need gold more than you do. Rather than let your confidence get the better of you, systematically use your much stronger TEAM (THAT MEANS 5 OF YOU TOGETHER) to take objectives, invade their side of the map, set up ambushes, take whatever the hell you want, get picks and then steamroll them when the time is right. THIS IS WHERE LEVEL 2 RED TRINKET COMES IN VERY, VERY HANDY BY THE WAY!\n\nThere is so much more. So, so, so much more. I know you&#039;ll read this and go, &quot;Oh, this boy is silver trash. No need to listen to him. Let&#039;s just do the old, &#039;Dude, you&#039;re in silver&#039;, and move on.&quot; Do yourself a favour and if you don&#039;t know the things I&#039;ve said, put them firmly into practice.\n\nI just asked a Lucian top, \"Hey, you playing for fun or actually playing to win?\" He says, \"To win.\" \n\n-_-;;;;;\n\nSee?

I keep getting told that if you can't pull yourself out of silver/gold, I'm trash. Can I ask, how many people actually climb out of ELO hell alone? Like, is it possible to do without a partner? <--- genuinely curious\n\nLast season I managed to climb my way out of bronze into high silver (before my last week before end of season tilt). This season with the introduction of dynamic queue, it seemed more logical to me to play with as many friends as possible to climb together so that I could ensure that I wouldn't have laggers/afks/toxins/feeders in my team. It was a lot easier to climb with a team than as a solo player, but I have found that a simple duo/trio is perfect for climbing as you don't have to put up with the vsing better premades and can still prey on the lack of comms on the enemy team. \n\n>Look at my match history. I don't think I've had a game in which one or more of my teammates haven't just died and died and died and died... They die once and the floodgates open and they just die over and over again.\n\nSometimes people have bad games and tilt, it happens in almost every game in every elo, you will have somebody that isn't able to play safe and stop dying even if they are trying their hardest. Telling them to \"stop feeding\" isn't helpful at all, and nor is telling them to \"just play safe\" as it is quite a generic statement and it gets frustrating if you are playing \"safe\" but are still dying. \nTilt prevention and playing from behind is something a lot of players need to work on, I totally agree, but it is something that is constantly a work in progress and will be different for every single person.\n\n>If I ADC, I will get a support that does not help me farm if I'm put under turret. I mean, is it not the obvious thing to do? Just give those ranged minions a tap for your ADC. It's all good.\n\nCreep wave manipulation is a skill that doesn't usually come actively into the minds of players in bronze/silver/gold and even sometimes plat. A lot of people don't know how many auto attacks you need to kill a minion under tower when factoring in tower shots. It is something that needs to be practiced, and in some cases clearly communicated. At the beginning of the game, if you are against a botlane that is gonna push you under tower (or even just for the sake of letting your supp know), just mention that if you guys are farming under tower to boop the caster minions once (ofc factoring in allied minion aggro) to help you last hit. \n\n>If we're ahead, my team will get carried away and start doing the most ridiculous things\n\nTake the lead and pull them in. \"Guys, I know we are ahead but if we keep derping instead of taking objectives, we are gonna throw and lose the game\". Usually they will agree and start working together again with less ♥♥♥♥ ups.\n\n>Another thing. Chasing and sight. Um... probably don't chase a Trundle halfway across the map. If you have map hack and you can see their entire team's whereabouts, go ahead, but obviously you don't have map hack. So just back off.\n\nImportant point, and you can try to reign in your team for this. However, it does seem to be pretty ingrained into the mentality for some players who still think \"kills and kda wins games and proves i deserve diamond\", and its something you have accept as probably going to happen and learn to deal with it. Come up with your own strategies of coping with a team that wont listen and keep chasing. My strategy was to team up with a toplane main that loves to split push, so all I had to do was try and co-erce my team into pushing objectives on the opposite side of the map.\n\n>Upgrading trinkets. Holy moly... holy moly... holy moly... why not? Why not? Why do supports run around with a Sightstone and yellow trinket? Why not upgrade? Seriously, why not? That goes for most other roles as well. I can't bear seeing level 18s run around with yellow trinket. Do you know that you don't have to facecheck if you upgrade to blue trinket? Do you know that level 2 red trinket can help your team go places undetected? BY THE WAY - UPGRADING IS FREE! JUST HIT LEVEL 9. LOL!\n\nSupport I agree with, other lanes can be debated. Yellow trinket is still useful for having stealth wards on objectives, that will need to be cleared by a sweeper/pink ward. Blues only take one hit and then you lose vision. It takes enough time to kill a stealth ward that if you are looking at the map you will take notice and rally your team to get there in time to contest. Yellow trinket is also useful in cases where you have a split push and need a ward to tp to. Too often supports have run out of ward charges on sightstone and someone will need to drop a stealth (especially late game where no slot for vision wards) to get that game changing TP. \n\n>Giving blue to mid... guys... if the enemy Orianna has blue and your Twisted Fate doesn't have blue, what happens?\n\nA given in most situations, but you have to also look at why the jungler isn't giving up the buff. Are they needing the gold so they can hit an item powerspike faster? Are they low in exp? Having trouble controlling their mana? \n\n>CS. Holy cow. CS is so low. So, so, so, so low. Incredibly low.\n\nLet's face it- CS is actually a pretty hard skill to master and to maintain consistently. A lot of players neglect it, and by doing so wont actually climb very high. Generally if I feel like someone needs to work on their CS, I will add them after game and link them [this guide](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH). I do it in a non-hostile manner and also complement other things they did well in the game. Most of the time they thank me. \n\nMinute things were pretty on point.\n\n>Guys, no matter how far ahead you are, anything less than a 5v5 is foolhardy. \n\nHonestly, this point depends on a lot of factors. What are your win conditions? What are the enemies? What kind of team comp are you running/ what are they running? What do you think is the skill level of your players (even if your team has the perfect split push comp, is your split pusher not going to be able to do his job well enough) etc. sometimes it is better to 1-4 split push over a 5v5. You just gotta think about it critically and communicate clearly with your team.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-05-31T14:12:00.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good feedback, but I disagree with some of the stuff that you say is not intuitive.

By the time the second fight started I ended the game.\n\nYou need to recognise how both teams are playing. Are they fighting constantly? Help for the shortest amount of time you can, if not just go and farm or take an objective if possible. If your team loses a fight, stand your ground when defending a tower. I couldn't tell you how many times I sit, alone under our inhib turret. Harassing and standing my ground against 3+ enemies. Most of the time in the low brackets people lose confidence and won't dive you. If they dive you, live for as long as possible and take one with you if you can.
