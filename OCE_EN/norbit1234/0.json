When your visible rank matches your relative skill, you will stop climbing and plateau. At this point where rank matches skill, the skill has to improve for the rank to.\n\nFor example, you play a game versing people evenly matched with you and win. Great! You were better than those people so the system is going to assume some improvement. You then verse people slightly higher than those last ones and you lose, ok you must be a touch lower than them. Rinse and repeat.\n\nPlaying against people of your accurate rank your win-rate will sit at 50%, because that's how the system is designed. You don't climb by playing games, you climb by improving, otherwise, the people in Challenger would be the people who play the most games per day, not the people who have the highest skill on the server.\n\nTeams are a factor, yes, but you are the only common factor in all of your games, so over a large enough sample size, the team factor is practically speaking eliminated from the equation.","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-11-17T12:31:16.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **Teams are a factor, yes, but you are the only common factor in all of your games, so over a large enough sample size, _the team factor is practically speaking eliminated from the equation._**\n\nThat is nonsense. League of Legends is a team-oriented game. Your individual play and skill is not relative or a conversion for guaranteed wins. Over a large enough sample size of games, team factor IS and will ALWAYS practically be included in the equation on top of your own personal contribution. \n\nYou also undervalue and not appreciate the fact that as LoL is heavily reliant on team work, the end-goal is to collectively **win with your team**. This also credits those who AFK, grief, intentionally feed or give up purposely in which **unfortunately affects the true individual player's skill in conjunction with MMR and winrate representation.**\n\nThe system does not screen test player's IRL mentality, psychological/mental health and from that point their behaviour in which they portray in a ranked game. An individual could practically be a Plat 1 player however matchmaking is systematically flawed to skew better teams on the enemy side while you're held captive to deal with those on potential losing streaks and negative winrates coupled with behaviour that is common to that of rage and tilt. \n\nYou also fail to acknowledge that you climb having built the confidence from your own skill that has improved while praying to the Riot RNG Gods that matchmaking is actually even and favoured your way in addition to having team mates with strong mental fortitude. Don't discount the fact that these are real factors, and while you're in control of your own gameplay, actions and effort - this does not sway your team member's behaviour and their ability to overwhelmingly surrender from 20 minutes onwards.\n\nNot even a high elo player who is smurfing can completely 1v9, given the circumstances described above. They hope that their team just feeds less and respond to pings so that they can be carried which unfortunately in most cases within low elo iron-gold (majority of the LoL community) listening and learning to be carried is somewhat challenging for those individuals to grasp.\n\nThis is why I do not feel sorry for those in low elo. I also do not feel sorry for those who choose to climb higher knowing the stress that comes with the grind in solo queue. We've all been there once and it can be frustrating however the competitive edge in this game makes it that personal rank is bragging rights for many. \n\nYou may be an Emissary that cheerleads for Riot however your statement on this matter doesn't countenance additional subjective factors on how ranked actually rounds off functioning.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2019-11-19T13:54:57.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Teams are a factor, yes, but you are the only common factor in all of your games, so over a large enough sample size, the team factor is practically speaking eliminated from the equation.\n\nI think Dragon's point is that over a huge amount of games, your individual level of play is what remains consistent. You will get carried some games, you will 1v9 other games, you might have the worst team imaginable in other games, but over a long period of time you will average out to your \"true\" rank.\nThere is a reason why Grandmaster+ players play 8+ hours a day, and lower elos tend to play less, or play more norms.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-20T01:34:34.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much sums it up yes :) The *team* factor, not the *teamwork* factor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-18T08:40:14.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said that teamwork as a skill is not relevant or will be cancelled out. What I said was the bad/good/average *teammates* will all balance out over time. The \"team factor\" I was referring to was the team factor that the OP was talking about, not teamwork as a skill.\n\nAs far as AFKs and the like, it's a valid point but it doesn't affect MMR, because MMR is a *relative* representation of skill. That is it only has value when compared to the MMR of others, the number itself is meaningless.  Everyone else experiences all tose same hiccups so it all equalises.\n\nIt doesn't screen mentality because it doesn't have to. The system is designed to represent your average skill as the best representation of where you sit. You aren't going to be judged by your worst or your best games, but the average of all your best, worst, and everything in-between games. Someone who regularly plays with a bad mental state will only punish themselves in the long run.","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-11-21T03:28:02.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll agree to disagree with your follow up comment on AFKs and the like. AFKs + the lot contribute to losses in which the true MMR of an individual who is caught with these team mates falters with potentially an MMR (+/-) of their actual skill representation (even over time)\n\nAs for behaviour screening, it was a passing point. \n\nThe system is not perfect and still puts together teams where it may seem fit/balanced etc although there are discrepancies which Riot have mentioned still exist; however try to make it as fair as possible with matchmaking even if it looks unfair for one side. This isn't made up.\n\nUltimately Riot needs to improve on a lot of things with their ranked system in regards to AFKS, remakes and so on. One individual could be a pretty tilt-free positive, blazé person when playing in solo queue and still be managed to be put with teams below their individual skill level and go on a losing streak + still be punished in the long run.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2019-11-17T05:12:37.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what happens if im losing then do i get put with better people or people worse then especially since im getting put with bronze people and im s1 ive had 700 games ive seen the same trend and its fucking not fare and the sad thing is i get put with BOTS explain whats the cause of this ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-17T06:40:33.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Visible rank and MMR won't always match because MMR catches up to true skill quickly (to maintain matchmaking integrity) and visible rank catches up slowly (to create the progression and encourage consistency to maintain a rank). \n\nIf you're getting matched with/against visible Bronze, then it's because either their MMR is higher than their rank or yours is lower than your rank (or some combination of the two). Basically, for whichever reason, your MMR matches theirs and so you are placed in their games.\n\nIf you are at a maintained rank and start losing, you'll start getting placed with and against lower MMR people. If you are where you are meant to be then the system expects you to start winning these games to maintain your rank. If you start losing them, then it stands to reason the MMR you reached was too high for you to maintain and so you will slowly drop. If you win them as the system expects then great, you have maintained your rank. Again, the reverse is also true.\n\nThere is a decent amount of short-term wiggle room to account for the general discrepancy in skill that a human will experience. Maybe you were cold when you played a game and your physical reaction time I slower. Maybe you're distracted and you aren't as present. Maybe you're super focused and are hyper-aware. There are hundreds of factors that go into a player's skill and the only way to equalise all of them is time and large sample sizes.\n\nVisible rank is something that becomes more accurate over time, so the less games played, the less accurate visible rank will be since that player could well be halfway through a climb or fall.\n\nAs for bots, there are practically speaking no bots in ranked. Only a tiny percentage of bots even make it to level 30. This is why you see them in co-op vs AI and low level+MMR ARAMs (and the rare normal) and nowhere else, and the only reason some of them make it that far is because bots are banned in waves to obscure detection methods, not instantaneously upon detection.\n\nLooking at your recent games, it's pretty clear you've hit your plateau. For every loss streak, you pretty much have a matching win streak. Your overall win-rate would indicate that you're either pretty much spot on where you should be, or just a touch above it. The hurdle from Silver to Gold is also bigger than the hurdle from Bronze to Silver (and this trend continues into the upper ranks).\n\n___\n\nIf you want my (basic) advice, read on, if not, just ignore this last part.\n\nConsistency is key. Most of your wins you perform consistently well, but in losses your scores drop very quickly. Some of this is unavoidable by the nature of a losing game, but learning how to play from behind is an important skill that will carry you far.\n\nWarding. A super important skill for everyone but especially so for Jungle and Support. Supports have access to free wards but jungles only have their trinkets (and often Red trinket is the way to go). This means there is a massive extra interest in Red wards for junglers to control vision, and many games you are forgetting to buy any (I'm guilty of this too). Top lane also has limited wards and no Support presence on their side of the map, so again vision control becomes very important.\n\nYour CS is impressive (even in your losses) so kudos for that one! There's always room for improvement of course, but you're pretty consistently above the average for your rank.\n\nOn the flip side, generally speaking your kill participation is quite low. Some games you do really well but again see that consistency note. Of course, this is a trickier one to nail down because there are a wide variety of reasons for low KP and some of them are unavoidable. Most of them ultimately come down to macro though. Knowing when to rotate, when to engage with your team and when to hold off, when to start stuff on your own or move to group etc etc.\n\nTake all that with a grain of salt though. I didn't watch replays, simply made suggestions based on the average of various stats. Some points will be more relevant than others and how to tailor it all to your playstyle depends largely on you.","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2019-11-18T06:26:59.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If thats the case how do i play with people that is so shitt and derank me further i have lost so many promotional games its not funny with 700 RANK GAMES may i ask you how the fuck do i deal with this shit its a team game GREAT but what do i do when somebody wants to feed intent may i say ff at 15 cause we are behind in a fucking rank game MMR decides the teams im with you say how can that be when im getting them all the fucking time an as i derank its get much worse and theres no way out it because it just continues to happening people make no fucking effort, i dont play for a few days come back on and it continues to FUCKEN HAPPEN IM SO SICK OF IT NOW ITS FUCKING BULLSHIT how can i play with people who know how to play the game its so fucken annoying playing with people who just came from there promotional games then just decide to feel ok lets feed or intent or much worse fucken AFK HOOWWWW????? im so fucking tilted i dont deserve this shit__","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-18T08:57:04.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But have you actually de-ranked?\n\nSo far as I can tell you're pretty consistently maintaining that Silver 1 rank. You're highest end of season rank is Gold 5, last season was Silver 2. The ranks shifted a bit with the addition of Iron but Gold mostly stayed where it was (intentionally). You haven't climbed, but you also haven't dropped.\n\nThere will obviously be a degree of fluctuation if you continue to play games, but generally not more than a division or two. \n\nBelieve me, I understand the frustration of people being toxic, or afking or saying bullshit like \"sorry guys gotta go\" 10 minutes into a  *ranked game*. Especially this time of the season where the stakes are so much higher things tend to be exacerbated.\n\nThe best advice I can offer you, is that letting the tilt get to you this much hurts you *far* more than it hurts the people who cause it. We just don't play as well when we are tilted. The short version I suppose is don't bring old beef and leftover tilt into the new game.\n\nMost of those people who are doing badly, aren't doing so on purpose, and aren't doing so because they don't belong in your game. Your own scores can attest to some pretty shocking stats when in an overall losing game, and they can also attest to some games just really not going your way. \n\nThis applies to *everyone*. Me, you, Fred from down the road. Everyone experiences this, and to expect everyone else to play their perfect game every time when we ourselves cannot achieve (because it's impossible) that is only going to create grief for all involved.\n\nAs far as afks, toxics, genuine intent feeders, etc, report them, know that in the substantial Silver population you aren't likely to see them again and move in. They're really not worth your effort.\n\nFrom an academic perspective, I would suggest you take a google on Negativity Bias. It's a powerful psychological quirk and it can really cost you some sanity if you aren't aware of it.\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, I would suggest that you take a step back and evaluate what it is you care about most in League. Ranked is hugely important to many players and with good reason, but at the end of the day this is still a game, and if your experience with it is more negative than positive, something isn't right.","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2019-11-19T09:17:12.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well firstly im trying to get better but of course fucking not with people who feed lanes and then im an easy kill in the game or in every game in that perspective secondly i know losing is part of the game but losing all the time and 5 or 10 games in a ROW is bull shit i know mmr comes into factor but being part of a game where everybody does there own thing and being a team game i dont see shit happening together is ultimate retarded and thirdly how am i suppose to evaluate what im doing wrong when everytime the teams just wants to feed after dieng once am i intended to be put in with tilted people, people doing bad especially looking up the history of some people paired with in my team are bloody horrible or is it cause LEAGUE OF LEGENDS itself dosent wanna see people like me climb especailly with the hard grind and long HOURS i do every fucking year with this game same shit different year and its only getting worse in conclusion \"negative \" you say of course im fucking pissed off, \"got a serious problem\" you say of course i have a problem its fucking unfair seeing stupid people being put in my team i know i cant get the best teams but why put me with fucking idiots maybe pass a message on the fucking creators fix the rank system ASAP because its completely fucking STUPID being put with retards","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-17T05:47:54.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NORBIT1234,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=AvuXWLZF,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-11-17T05:12:37.807+0000)\n>\n> So what happens if im losing then do i get put with better people or people worse then especially since im getting put with bronze people and im s1 ive had 700 games ive seen the same trend and its fucking not fare and the sad thing is i get put with BOTS explain whats the cause of this ?\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/wPkMrL9H-what-the-fuck-is-up-with-rank-losing-1-game-then-lose-fucking-10-games-and-put-with-people-who-afk?comment=0001","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-17T06:11:49.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"howcome making multiple threads is allowed but refreshing dead ones that have relevant links and info isn't?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-17T06:45:00.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because this one was borderline where the content was similar but not the same so we erred on the side of not deleting.\n\nAs far as refreshing posts goes, we don't stop people from posting new threads with old content (even if you were to link to that old post and quote the relevant info you want to discuss), but we lock those threads because more often than not the OP and most of the commenters are no longer active or have already had the discussion.\n\nWhere there is value in starting a new discussion with new people, reviving old threads often results in one or two comments and the thread itself stays dead, hence why we lock them.\n\nAlso worth noting that neither of these (unless the spam is especailyl egregious) results in any form of punishment, it's only a simple deletion.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-18T17:59:24.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=AvuXWLZF,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2019-11-17T06:45:00.316+0000)\n>\n> Because this one was borderline where the content was similar but not the same so we erred on the side of not deleting.\n> \n> As far as refreshing posts goes, we don't stop people from posting new threads with old content (even if you were to link to that old post and quote the relevant info you want to discuss), but we lock those threads because more often than not the OP and most of the commenters are no longer active or have already had the discussion.\n> \n> Where there is value in starting a new discussion with new people, reviving old threads often results in one or two comments and the thread itself stays dead, hence why we lock them.\n> \n> Also worth noting that neither of these (unless the spam is especailyl egregious) results in any form of punishment, it's only a simple deletion.\n\nmkay tenk yu","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-20T02:34:29.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a 3rd day of testing on unnecessary splitters, noobs, afks, griefers, and tilters (more trolls), it showed up even worse.
