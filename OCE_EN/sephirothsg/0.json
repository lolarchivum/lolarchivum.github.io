I remember hearing a lot of complaints at the time that people didn't get in because once the award had been achieved they stopped counting the points.  \n\nStill this year was a more evenly run event, the 2015 was their first effort and they didn't expect the response. If i remember correctly Riot posted a lot of surprise at the fact we got the points so quickly as it was not anywhere near the average games at the time.\n\nAnyway, Well done guys, I'll have to visit the reef before sea life covers most of the plates.\n\n~Tribalmind","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCG LittleKaz","date":"2016-04-11T11:36:23.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was on OCE server at the time, did I earn the points in time?\nI was super sad to discover I was not on the statue, I don't normally play normal matchmade games but I remember working hard during the event to play the needed games!\nI know I have no 2016 points (was moving at the time QQ).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarySkarner","date":"2016-04-11T08:57:49.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My name isn't on the Nautilus Statue?
