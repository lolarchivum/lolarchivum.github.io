I understand not getting any ranked rewards for being gold because I&#039;m honour level 0 or whatever I am, but having my border I got taken away from last season? I&#039;m a person who&#039;s had at least  10 perm banned accounts that were level 30+, at least 20 accounts between level 1-30 that got a 14 day suspension that I&#039;ve given up on, but that&#039;s in the past for me, this season I&#039;ve had maybe 1 or 2 chat restrictions on 1 account and 2 14 days on 2 separate accounts, now that may sound really bad to all of you but knowing my history with toxicity in this game that&#039;s a MASSIVE improvement, in season  7 I got probably at least 3 accounts lvl 30+ perm banned, many 14 day suspensions, many chat restrictions, you name it I&#039;ve probably been punished for it.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m not here to brag about my toxicity or anything, there is a point I&#039;m getting to, the point is this, wasn&#039;t the 14 day suspension/chat restriction already the punishment? I haven&#039;t been punished on this account for at least 3 months. I served my 14 days, I played my 30 games chat restricted, now further down the line, after I haven&#039;t made any mistakes, gotten any punishments or anything like that, not only am I not going to receive my Orianna skin but I also get what I earned through blood sweat and fucking tears taken away from me, why? I literally took a level 1 account, grinded it all the way to gold 5 in 4-6 days because I had just got my other main perm banned and I&#039;m a Graves main so I needed to get the skin and there was only 10 days or something left of the season. I&#039;ve NEVER had an account last as long as this one, I&#039;ve been trying my hardest to stay cool and not get tilted or angry at my teams, I&#039;ve put my past of toxicity and inting in the past and I&#039;ve been trying my very hardest to reform but in the end it means nothing because this fucking honour system takes all year to grind it out to level 5.\r\n\r\nYou know what stuff like this does? It makes me want to run it down, it makes me want to flame my teams, it makes me not want to reform because I&#039;m seeing all my effort be for nothing. This is extremely disheartening and it&#039;s made me mad enough to post this entire essay knowing full well that nobody at riot cares, nor will anything be done about it, take away my end of season rewards even though I haven&#039;t had a punishment in at least a quarter of a year, take away my ability to get a champion faster than once a month even though I play 10 games a day because I can&#039;t get any key shards for all these chests, but what&#039;s the point of taking away my border? This company is fucking disgraceful and if it wasn&#039;t the most popular MOBA I wouldn&#039;t play it, fuck you riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Yikes Bud","date":"2018-11-22T12:26:58.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a similar problem, but mine is i haven't received my boarder at the end of the season.

But not handing out rewards based off Honor levels is a no-go, and I am certain many, many others agree with me. I can finally see why many players felt the Honor system wasn't a good choice, regardless of how well of a deterrent it tries to be against bad behavior.\n\n_I'll try to elaborate more as to why I feel this way_\n\nThis system is literally taking away potentially an entire 12 months of work and preparation away from someone, only from a minor punishment & **one** bad game that resulted in said punishment, because it dropped their Honor to 0 or 1 so close to the end of the season.\n\nThis is obviously an imbalance on a scale of morality/ethics, tipped in a large favor of punishment and disregard for the player with how long Riot and the community knows it can take just to go up a single honor level.\n\nRiot should be withholding or restricting such rewards, only in the instance of the abusive player **currently** serving out a punishment **when** the ranked season ends, because it would be better by not having to deal with further, unnecessary repercussions after the punishment was served so close to seasons end.\n\nIt's kind of like reading the fine print at a dealers contract, but still getting surprised by a shady car dealer, which is an analogy that holds weight _**considering ranked borders were not explicitly listed as something that Honor levels below 2 would be exempt from, as thats why I landed here after having to search it up!**_\n\nThese are rewards for achieving a Rank, not simply rewarding for bad behavior (if anyone dares bring that crap up fyi). A years worth of work for merely a border, at least, holds more weight than a single bad game of abusive behavior, but I guess that's human nature - negativity seems to flow more than positivity and an optimistic handling of the bad behavior. A criminal for example can have committed their crime and served a sentence, but to further deny them certain welfare benefits or employment is an affront to their progress. The same can be said as a player of League of Legends in relation to its punishment & rewards systems.\n\n**You having _rightfully_ earned your hard-worked-for rank at the end of the season, in my opinion, is completely irrelevant to how a player behaves and the punishments they can already be issued that can handle _and_ deter future bad behavior.** Just do mutes, suspensions and bans, and then remove the Honor system and bring back the old honoring system; it was working just fine.\n\n_Unless of course, someone wants to just run up here and say, \"Then dont act bad when playing the game\", lol.. SMH, they obviously dont understand with that line of thinking._\n\nIn short, if you wanted to punish someone, all you had to do was issue the previously mentioned chat restrictions, bans, and suspensions, but Riot thinks it necessary to go even farther by literally disqualifying people at _least_ the rank borders they rightfully earned.\n\nIf you think that's a necessary punishment, you are incorrect, for that is why chat mutes/restrictions, bans and suspensions already existed for; it's not morally sound to try and play nanny, like how Jagex ruined Runescape. You can't even banter or playfully tease, or even defend yourself in an argument against someone, no matter how heated it becomes, without being threatened or outright punished.\n\nI've defended myself against many a player in-game while they go off on a lousy tirade about how \"bad\" of a player I was, only to have them mute me because I was using sound logic. That same manner of defending myself is what lead up to this 'punishment', if that's what you would prefer it to be called. I was just punished because I didn't make it sound eloquent, and 'nice'.\n\nWhat does rank have anything to do with behavior? Do not try to connect the two.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSide note, I guess it's not that bad, considering I can just as easily refuse to allow end-of-season rewards and ill-minded players to define me and how well I know I play the game, which kind of nullifies or voids the punishment anyway, outside of literal account suspensions and bans. Being hardstuck where you don't belong is tough guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-23T11:14:41.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">The punishment, was already handled and dealt with.\n\nThere's two things I think are key here. First of all, chat restrictions only drop you to Honour 1, so if you were dropped to 0 it's because you were already below H2, in other words, not your first punishment. This is in essence what the honour system is designed to reflect -consistency.\n\nSecondly, Riot have acknowledged that the punishment for receiving a chat restriction (which are generally for relatively minor offences) close to the end of the season is too harsh, especially in comparison to previous seasons, and so have taken steps to both alleviate that and measure the effect it has had: https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/LePhAybx-2018-end-of-season-rewards-and-honor\n\n>considering ranked borders were not explicitly listed as something that Honor levels below 2 would be exempt from, as thats why I landed here after having to search it up!\n\nBorders have always fallen the umbrella of 'ranked rewards', they have been considered such for years. I felt it was rather self explanatory given, as you say yourself, they are a reward you receive for playing ranked, in much the same way no-one expects Riot to explicitly state every skin they've ever created when referring to 'skins' in an official capacity, but perhaps some clarification is due there.\n\n>if you wanted to punish someone, all you had to do was issue the previously mentioned chat restrictions, bans, and suspensions\n\nIf this was true then permanent suspensions wouldn't have to exist. If everyone received a restriction and went \"oh, they don't allow this here\" and, whether they agree with the rule or not, accept that they have agreed to follow them, then there would be no need for permanent suspensions. \n\nYou will never make every individual fit the same mould, and Riot don't have the luxury of catering to individuals, they have to use essentially catch-all methods. Loss of ranked rewards is such a significant deterrent *because* it has such meaning to players. Many of the players who are problematic because they couldn't give two shits about the other people playing the game, *do* care about their rank and the rewards and recognition that go with it.\n\nIf a deterrent means nothing to the individual in question, it's not a very good deterrent.\n\n>What does rank have anything to do with behavior? Do not try to connect the two.\n\nBut they *are* connected. They are connected inherently by the fact that this *is not* a solo experience. League of Legends is a *team game* so yes, your treatment of other players and your rank are explicitly linked.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-27T00:18:04.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't argue with that, when my whole team shit talks me and then blames me when they are all playing like shit and then I lose mmr because of that.

Being below honour 2 makes you ineligible for *all* ranked rewards. You don't have to be Honour 5, which takes a large chunk of the season because it's meant to be a season long accomplishment (honour is about consistency). You do have to be Honour 2.\n\nI'm not sure what more I can say. It's essentially about rewarding positive (or at least neutral) play, and not encouraging negativity. Loss of ranked rewards is a heavy blow for a lot of players, and that's pretty much the point. If you struggle with your behaviour, mute all and move your chat off screen, consider using a program to unbind your enter key while you are in game.","replies":[{"poster":"ÎII","date":"2018-11-22T14:52:45.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know you don't have to be honour 5, and like I said I don't struggle with my behaviour, I'm reformed, thanks for your useless response though chief :)","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-23T01:16:31.909+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the part Seras Dragon may have left unaddressed is why your border from the 2017 season is gone.\nBorders are an indicator of your ranked performance in your most recent season.
