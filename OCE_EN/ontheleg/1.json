me to flame. They to leash me at lvl 1 jg, then they intentionally fed bot lane for the fun of it, then they start typing in all chat that i should be banked for refusing to gank them which inadvertently lead to me flamming and getting quite upset. Bot lane then preceeded to follow me around and take my jg camps whenever i didnt have smite, making the game 3 v 5 with bot lane trolling. How come people like that are not punished and i am for calling them &quot;%%%%s&quot; or telling them to &quot;fuck off&quot; because they are following me around everywhere?\r\n\r\nIn Game number 3, i was playing with mates and flamming at them just as a joke, we do it all the time. However other people on the team decided to report me because they didnt understand the context of my flamming as being a joke with people ive known for 6 or more years.  You can clearly tell im talking to my mates in the first few likes where i am specifically naming some of my friends names to 2 other mates in game because they asked me where he went. Why should i get banned for having a joke with my mates?\r\n\r\nGame number 2 is the only bannable thing out of these 3 texts. Yes what i said was extremely offensive to any asian people and to others even witnessing that stuff. I agree it was completely wrong and i do ask for a forgiveness, i have learnt from my lessons and i understand that i shouldnt say anything of those sorts. I shouldnt even say the word fuck to be honest in the chat as it does seem to be offensive to some league of legends players and the community. I will do anything just to get my account back and i mean anything, if it means one last chance and im perma banned then im fine with that, if it means doing some community work ill do that too, please help :(. Im really sorry.\r\n\r\nThank you for spending your time reading this. If there is anything you can do please help :).","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-22T00:34:02.129+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, your attitude is toxic to the point of creating an extremely negative experience for everyone on your team purely because of how you felt towards others. Game 1; no issues with the ban Game 2; game 2... no comment needed. Game 3; On your next account, perhaps let people now \"These are my friends, its how we get along\" \n\nLearn your lesson, remake. Realise that maturity and reason is the answer, not returning toxic attitude. Be above it, not under it. Regardless of others triggering your anger or not. It's up to you with how you respond. And you responded with racism, language i assume is like c**t not many four letter words in australia that offends anyone. So i guess it's that. We're in Oce, fuck isn't a swear word here. But considering that it is open to all ages, you are expected not to use excessive profanity just to emphasize a point. \n\nYou've brought it on yourself. I hope the lesson is learnt and when you make a new account, you won't continue this sort of behavior. Initiated by others or not. In saying that, it is up to you to also report people whom are unsportsmanlike and toxic. \n\n\nThe most toxic thing in this community is people do not accept responsibility for their actions... Quick to claim any glory, fast to deny wrong doing. \n\nYou have to be in a position that is above that to feel you have any credible reason to complain. You haven't, you're both in the wrong, but mostly from the games shown and text shown. Your own actions regardless have earned you the punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-22T01:45:48.458+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Game one\n**TL;DR**\n* Didn't help team\n>* Blamed/trashtalked your laners\n\nActually,[ not helping your team IS reportable behaviour](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q4). \nCalling your teammates intentional feeders and trolls is not seeing a positive atmosphere.

You likened someone's life to an insult. If you aren't playing in a full premade, you should't be saying this kind of stuff in chat. It is incredibly toxic and players not in on the joke will report you for it.

Which is what it looks like happened to you. \n\nIf you believe the ban was in error, you can send in a support ticket to appeal your case (**your ban was fully justified so that will not get you your account back**).
