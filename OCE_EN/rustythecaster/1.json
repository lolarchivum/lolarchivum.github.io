For those of you tuning in for the first time, the OOL is the semi-pro ladder for teams looking to qualify for the Oceanic Challenger Series and one day shoot for qualification into the Oceanic Pro League.\n\nBelow you can find how to join the second split of OOL action.\n\n**_The week starting the 6th of June, the second split of the Oceanic Open Ladder (OOL) will officially commence. The two day tournament will take place every fortnight, Saturday and Sunday . There will be four tournaments total throughout the duration of the OOL, with one playoff week to round it out and crown the winners. Winners will get their shot at making it into the Challenger League (OCS), and as such, eventually the Oceanic Pro League (OPL)._**\n\nLast split we saw 2 of our top teams, Abyss Black &amp; Sin Fighto, qualify into the Oceanic Challenger Series (OCS) to compete for their shot into the OPL. The breeding grounds of the OOL saw **69 unique teams** competing throughout, with **29 of those playing in more than 1 week**, consecutively or not.\n\nThis will be an opportunity for anybody to enter,** with a natural edge towards the most competitive and consistent players and teams.**  Every second weekend will see the action resume, with dates available on our Leagues Page, or our OOL Battlefy Website (Where you also sign up).\n \n**How can I sign up?**\n\nYour Path to Pro can  be found [on Battlefy here!](https://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder)\nThe first two weeks are available now, with the rest to be added per tournament completion.\n \n**What is the schedule?**\n\nWeek 1 Tournament (June 11 ~ June 12)\nWeek 2 Tournament (June 25 ~ June 26)\nWeek 3 Tournament (July 9 ~ July 10)\nWeek 4 Tournament (July 23 ~ July 24)\nWeek 5 Playoff Tournament  (August 6 ~ 7)\nPromo/Relo (August 27 ~ 28)\n \n**Is there still Prizing?**\n\nPrizes shown are per player:\n\n**1st** &ndash; 3200 RP + Triumphant Ryze\n**2nd** &ndash; 2800 RP\n**3rd** &ndash; 2100 RP\n**4th** &ndash; 1100 RP\n**5th-8th** &ndash; 800 RP\n**9th-16th** &ndash; 500 RP\n\n**How do I qualify to the OCS?**\n\nYour way to qualifying into the Challenger Series is by accruing points. The points system will be decided on placements in both days of action. \n\n**Preliminaries (Day 1) Points**\n\n1st &ndash; 20 points\n2nd &ndash; 15 points\n3rd &ndash; 10 points\n4th &ndash; 5 points\n5th &ndash; 0 points\n\n**Playoffs (Day 2) Points**\n\n1st Place &ndash; 90 points\n2nd Place &ndash; 60 points\n3rd Place &ndash; 40 points\n4th Place &ndash; 30 points\n5 ~ 8th Place &ndash; 20 points\n9th ~ 16th Place &ndash; 10 points\n17th ~ 32nd Place &ndash; 5 points\n\nFor those who need to find the rules for competing within the OOL, they can be found here!\n[Rules!](http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com.s3.amazonaws.com/public/riot-oce/2016OOLRulesv1.0.pdf)\n\nFurther details or confirmation on dates, prizes  and structure, can be found on our league page below!\n[Leagues Page!](http://oce.lolesports.com/articles/oceanic-open-ladder-54687)\n\nIf that doesn&rsquo;t quite cut it, the Battlefy website once again has all of your needs fulfilled.\n[OOL Website!](https://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder)\n \nThanks a bunch and best of luck on the Rift.
