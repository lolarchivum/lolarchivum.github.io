Bronze is practically 'normals' elo, but if you make any mistakes you are SET ON FIRE.\n\nAs a newly entered plat summoner, I can tell you the time I was first unranked and in Bronze. I was put into Bronze 2, but quickly fell through the floor to Bronze 5. I stayed here a lot. I was bad. Basically, my tip is you can't trust ANYONE else on your team in Bronze or Silver to be good/make right decisions/communicate etc. EXPECT TROLLS! You have to improve yourself and your gameplay and carry your team, and ultimately carry yourself out of elo hell.\n\n~More helpful tips: be ready to fill. Don't be some douchebag who can only play one role or feed. You can announce your prefered role, but that might be someone else's preferred role, who picks before you, and you will have to deviate to another role.\n~When filling, practice champs for every role, and know certain matchups/counterpicks. You don't have to counterpick every single time, having champions you know well and are good at will be better than some counterpick you've never played before.\n~Upgrade your trinkets at level 9! Yes, even in Plat, people don't seem to think upgrading trinkets is important, IT'S GAMECHANGING. Having one stinky base ward trink is not enough: upgrade that for a mere 250g and you have a 2 charge Sightstone that recharges without having to go b.\n~Map awareness. Call out flash timers, call out where the enemy jungler was last seen. Use pings, but don't ever spam them. You'll get yourself ignored and reported at the end of the game.\n\nThose are just a few tips, there are a tonne more, but ultimately as I've said, at that low elo you need to carry yourself out. You'll have a load of crappy games, trust me, but you'll get lucky and climb through the ranks at some point. Also, when next season clocks around, don't play ranked right at the start - there are a bunch more trolls and bad players on at the start checking out the fresh season that will screw your games up. I was Silver at the start of this season and couldn't climb out due to this.\n\nHope I've helped mate, I know the feeling, and good luck! {{champion:254}}","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-01T14:12:55.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NxnjaHD,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1VvVqm5J,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-09-01T01:16:29.867+0000)\n> Hope I've helped mate, I know the feeling, and good luck! {{champion:254}}\n\nGood tips, thank you, but as you know, if you don't get your preferred lane or champion, or someone who can actually carry, you are pretty fucked.\n\nI play top or jungle a lot, I can Mid quite well and do OK at AD, but have always, and I mean ALWAYS sucked ass as support, no matter how much in the past I tried it, I just can't do it.\n\nThat said, I win my lane a lot, most of the time I ignore the other lanes if I am top unless my lane partner roams. More times than not I will keep my lane partner pushed and force ganks, yet more times than not, my team also loses their lane and start going ape shit.\n\nMy last game was the same, I won top as Gnar Vs. Rammus, really quite easy and avoiding their Udyr ganks was a piece of cake, he tried about 6 times in ¬15 minutes while I had 1 gank for 1 kill.\n\nin the meantime mid and bot both lost lane and while mid had a lot of kills, he was also dying a lot, 14/16 by end game and was toxic from about 10 minutes to the end, roughly half an hour of non stop shit talk.\n\nIf I don't get my lane and champion choice, and get a few early kills and CS, I can only hope my team does or no matter how well I play, I just can't carry. I have tried the Jungle path in the past, just focus on jungle as much as I can and while it worked well for myself, again if your team falls over, not much you can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Tonnkka","date":"2015-09-03T01:14:13.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I feel ya mate. It's a massive disadvantage in higher elo compared to lower elo's when a lane goes really bad. It topples the balance of the game, and when teamfights come around more often than not they come out on top due to a fed lane that they had.\n\nMore often than not, when I'm not in bot lane, they go extremely bad. When I am in bot lane, we do well, buuut they're jungler ganks more than our jungler ganks, or better yet mid lane rotates down and we weren't given ample warning. Or what is even BETTER is when they're jungler, AND mid laner gank us, or jungler and top lane tp's in. Eugh it's a pain in the ass.\n\nWell, from what you've said, keep practicing Support, perhaps in normals. It's not particularly hard, and there is lots of tips to come with that, but it is definately a carry role. Maybe try picks such as Leona, Soraka, Nautilus etc.\n\nJust keep practicing, practice makes perfect! ~And just ignore shit talk, it exists in every elo and they just do it to piss you off, and that reduces your gameplay capability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-08-31T20:38:05.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I'm only in Silver, but if I could offer up a tip on how I got to S5 from B5, take one champion you love, preferably a versatile one that can carry a game, and then learn the fuck outta that champ and pick that champ as much as possible and then carry yourself on said champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-01T14:14:18.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My 2 best are Yi jungle and Garen top, GG to me.

One of the best low elo solo queue carries in this meta tbh. Garen in this meta is also great! But, if you wanted champs in multiple roles... Kayle is pretty good! I was something of a Kayle main last season and I loved playing her, she can go top, jungle and mid comfortably. And she CAN bot lane too, just requires lot of practice. Another great one is Wukong. Top lane and Jungle Wu are very common and very strong, but, mid lane Wukong, is actually fucking terrifying man. Yasuo can both top and mid and if you really wanted to, you could even jungle him. Nidalee, top, jungle and mid. Cho, can top, jungle and mid. And, this would require an insane amount of practice, but Lulu can go in every single role and wreck. Top, mid and support Lulu are very common, but Jungle Lulu and AD Carry Lulu are not, but, are actually pretty good if played right.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EzPzRitopls","date":"2015-08-31T20:03:43.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm S1 on this account, I was being placed with plat 5+ and being the only silver in the game and 2 leagues/ranks below they felt the need to blame me for their stuff ups.
